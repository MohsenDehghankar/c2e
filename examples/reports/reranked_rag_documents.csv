40mg/day dosage of folic acid and 2mg/day dosage of vitamin B12 does not affect chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.,folic acid AND vitamin B12 AND chronic kidney disease AND progression,"31629573,30781775","[PMID: 31629573] In populations with folic acid fortification or supplementation, the main nutritional determinant of total homocysteine levels is vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (B12) status. We aimed to evaluate the modifying effect of B12 levels on the association between folic acid treatment and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. A post hoc analysis of an interventional trial. This is a post hoc analysis of 1,374 hypertensive adults with mild to moderate CKD and B12 measurements at baseline from the kidney disease substudy of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT), conducted in 20 communities in Jiangsu province in China, a region with low folate consumption. Assignments to a double-blinded daily treatment of enalapril, 10mg, and folic acid, 0.8mg; or enalapril, 10mg, alone. The primary outcome was progression of CKD (defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30% and to a level of<60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> if baseline eGFR was≥60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>; or a decrease in eGFR≥50% if baseline eGFR was<60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>; or kidney failure). Mean baseline eGFR in this study was 86.1±20.5 (SD) mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. Median treatment duration was 4.4 years. Among participants with higher baseline B12 levels (≥248pmol/L), compared to enalapril alone, enalapril-folic acid treatment was associated with an 83% reduction in the odds of the primary outcome (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.40). However, among those with baseline B12 levels<248pmol/L (metabolic B12 deficiency), there was no significant group difference in the primary outcome (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.51-2.85). The interaction between B12 level and folic acid treatment was significant (P = 0.001). The analysis is post hoc and event rate is low. Folic acid treatment was associated with a greater reduction in the odds of CKD progression among patients with mild to moderate CKD and higher B12 levels.

[PMID: 30781775] Patients affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) experience a huge cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular events represent the leading causes of death. Since traditional risk factors cannot fully explain such increased cardiovascular risk, interest in non-traditional risk factors, such as hyperhomocysteinemia and folic acid and vitamin B12 metabolism impairment, is growing. Although elevated homocysteine blood levels are often seen in patients with CKD and ESRD, whether hyperhomocysteinemia represents a reliable cardiovascular and mortality risk marker or a therapeutic target in this population is still unclear. In addition, folic acid and vitamin B12 could not only be mere cofactors in the homocysteine metabolism; they may have a direct action in determining tissue damage and cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this review was to highlight homocysteine, folic acid and vitamin B12 metabolism impairment in CKD and ESRD and to summarize available evidences on hyperhomocysteinemia, folic acid and vitamin B12 as cardiovascular risk markers, therapeutic target and risk factors for CKD progression.",2
A breast cancer patient's capacity to metabolize tamoxifen influences treatment outcome.,breast cancer AND tamoxifen AND metabolism AND treatment outcomes,"41031251,40705465,40645971","[PMID: 41031251] <b>Background:</b> Tamoxifen resistance remains a major clinical challenge in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, contributing to recurrence and poor prognosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), including MALAT1, UCA1, CYTOR, GAS5, and HOTAIR, have emerged as key regulators of endocrine resistance. Curcumin, a polyphenol with anticancer properties, modulates lncRNA expression, and its bioavailable formulation, NanoCurcumin, enhances therapeutic efficacy. This study evaluates the effects of NanoCurcumin in combination with tamoxifen on lncRNA expression and resistance mechanisms in ER+ breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> Plasma levels of the selected lncRNAs were assessed via qRT-PCR in luminal breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen alone or in combination with NanoCurcumin oral soft gels for 6 months. Bioinformatics analysis of MALAT1 expression was performed using the GEO database. In vitro, MALAT1 expression was evaluated in breast cancer (MCF7) and normal breast (MCF10) cell lines via qRT-PCR. Tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells were generated through prolonged treatment, and the effects of NanoCurcumin on MALAT1 expression were analyzed over 4 months. <b>Results:</b> In clinical samples, NanoCurcumin significantly reduced MALAT1 expression (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and trended toward decreased UCA1, CYTOR, and HOTAIR while increasing GAS5 expression. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed MALAT1 upregulation in tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. In vitro, MALAT1 was significantly elevated in MCF7 cells compared to MCF10 and increased over time with tamoxifen treatment alone. NanoCurcumin reversed this trend, sustaining low MALAT1 levels and mitigating resistance. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that NanoCurcumin mitigates tamoxifen resistance by downregulating MALAT1, offering a novel epigenetic strategy to enhance endocrine therapy efficacy. Further studies should explore lncRNA-targeted interventions to improve treatment outcomes in ER+ breast cancer.

[PMID: 40705465] BACKGROUNDEndocrine therapy (ET) with tamoxifen (TAM) or aromatase inhibitors (AI) is highly effective against hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive) early breast cancer (BC), but resistance remains a major challenge. The primary objectives of our study were to understand the underlying mechanisms of primary resistance and to identify potential biomarkers.METHODSWe selected more than 800 patients in 3 subcohorts (Discovery, n = 364, matched pairs; Validation 1, n = 270, Validation 2, n = 176) of the West German Study Group (WSG) ADAPT trial who underwent short-term preoperative TAM or AI treatment. Treatment response was assessed by immunohistochemical labeling of proliferating cells with Ki67 before and after ET. We performed comprehensive molecular profiling, including targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and DNA methylation analysis using EPIC arrays, on posttreatment tumor samples.RESULTSTP53 mutations were strongly associated with primary resistance to both TAM and AI. We identified distinct DNA methylation patterns in resistant tumors, suggesting alterations in key signaling pathways and tumor microenvironment composition. Based on these findings and patient age, we developed the Predictive Endocrine ResistanCe Index (PERCI). PERCI accurately stratified responders and nonresponders in both treatment groups in all 3 subcohorts and predicted progression-free survival in an external validation cohort and in the combined subcohorts.CONCLUSIONOur results highlight the potential of PERCI to guide personalized endocrine therapy and improve patient outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATIONWSG-ADAPT, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01779206, retrospectively registered 01-25-2013.FUNDINGGerman Cancer Aid (Grant Number 70112954), German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Grant Number 01ZZ1804C, DIFUTURE).

[PMID: 40645971] Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC), a distinct subtype of breast cancer, is hallmarked by E-Cadherin loss, slow proliferation, and strong hormone receptor positivity. ILC faces significant challenges in clinical management due to advanced stage at diagnosis, late recurrence, and development of resistance to endocrine therapy - a cornerstone of ILC treatment. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying endocrine resistance in ILC, ILC cell lines (MDA-MB-134-VI, SUM44PE) were generated to be resistant to tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. The tamoxifen-resistant (TAMR) cells exhibit a 2-fold increase in tamoxifen IC<sub>50</sub> relative to parental cells. Metabolomics and RNA-sequencing revealed deregulation of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, purine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism in TAMR cells. Among the fifteen commonly dysregulated genes in these pathways, low argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1) expression was identified in the TAMR cells and was significantly correlated with poor outcome in ILC patients, specifically in the context of endocrine therapy. Our study reveals methylation-mediated silencing of ASS1 in TAMR cells as a likely mechanism of downregulation. Demethylation restored ASS1 expression and correspondingly reduced tamoxifen IC<sub>50</sub> toward parental levels. Nucleic acid biosynthesis is augmented in TAMR cells, evidenced by an increase in nucleotide intermediates. Both TAMR cell lines demonstrated increased expression of several nucleic acid biosynthesis enzymes, including PAICS, PRPS1, ADSS2, CAD, and DHODH. Furthermore, CAD, the key multifunctional protein of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, is differentially activated in TAMR cells. Treating TAMR cells with Decitabine, a demethylating agent, or Farudodstat, a pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor, markedly augmented the efficacy of tamoxifen. Collectively, our study unveils ASS1 downregulation as a novel mechanism underlying acquired tamoxifen resistance in ILC and establishes a metabolic link between ASS1 and nucleic acid biosynthesis. Restoring ASS1 expression or inhibiting pyrimidine biosynthesis reinstated tamoxifen sensitivity. ASS1 could be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in tamoxifen-resistant ILC patients, warranting further investigation.",3
A deficiency of folate increases blood levels of homocysteine.,folate deficiency AND homocysteine AND relationship AND homocysteine elevation,"40354985,40156756,39571660","[PMID: 40354985] Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), one of the most common pregnancy complications, adversely affects maternal and fetal health. This study investigated the impact of vitamin D3 (VD3) deficiency or supplementation on placental long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) metabolism, one-carbon cycle metabolites, inflammation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and birth outcomes in a GDM rat model. Wistar rats were divided into five groups: Control (1000 IU VD3/kg diet), Vitamin D Deficient (VDD, 0 IU VD3/kg diet), GDM (1000 IU VD3/kg diet + GDM), VD3 supplementation with 1500 IU (VDS-1500 +GDM), and VD3 supplementation with 10,000 IU (VDS-10,000 +GDM). GDM was induced using a high-fat, high-sugar diet and streptozotocin. Diets were provided from weaning through pregnancy. Only the VDS-10,000 +GDM group achieved sufficient serum 25(OH)D levels (>30 ng/ml). 10,000 IU/kg VD3 supplementation reduced gestational weight gain and improved fetal/placental weight ratios. It reduced the levels of FBS, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR, while increased HOMA-IS. It regulated calcium homeostasis by decreasing parathyroid hormone and increasing phosphorous levels. It normalized one-carbon metabolites, reducing homocysteine and increasing folate levels. Both doses of VD3 supplementation mitigated oxidative stress, reducing malondialdehyde levels, which was higher in GDM and VDD groups. It restored LCPUFA profiles, increasing arachidonic acid and decreasing n-6 linoleic acid levels. High-dose VD3 reduced elevated plasma and placental TNF-α levels and downregulated IL-6 mRNA in the GDM group, while IL-6 protein levels remained comparable. The protein and mRNA levels of both VEGF and VEGF-R1 were higher in GDM group. 10,000 IU VD3 reduces VEGF levels whereas, 1500 IU VD3 reduces VEGF-R1 levels. High-dose VD3 supplementation (10,000 IU/kg) during pregnancy effectively improved vitamin D status and positively influenced placental metabolic pathways, oxidative stress, inflammation, and angiogenesis, thereby improving pregnancy outcomes in GDM.

[PMID: 40156756] Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by clinical heterogeneity and may be associated with cerebral folate deficiency (CFD). Among the causes, folate receptor alpha autoantibodies (FRAA) and variants of the SLC19A1 gene are commonly highlighted. The aim of this study was to analyze the rs1051266 variant of the SLC19A1 gene in patients with ASD and CFD and to determine its relationship with clinical and laboratory parameters. The study included 227 children with ASD, 156 of whom had CFD. FRAA detection, genotyping of the rs1051266 variant, and folate metabolism marker measurement (homocysteine, vitamins B9, B12, B6) were performed. FRAA binding was detected in 39.2% of ASD patients, blocking FRAA in 3.5%, and a specific soluble folate receptor in 13.2%. The 80GA genotype was the most common (46.3%), and homocysteine levels tended to be moderately elevated (upper quartile - 7.0). Significant correlations were found between homocysteine levels and vitamins B9, B12, and B6 (p < 0.05) and between verbal impairments and vitamin B12 (p = 0.043). In ASD and CFD patients, the 80GG genotype was more frequent (p = 0.03) and vitamin B12 levels were elevated (p = 0.021). In the ASD group, correlations were found between the 80AA genotype and demyelination (p = 0.020) and between homocysteine levels and demyelination (p = 0.042). In conclusion, the rs1051266 variant of the SLC19A1 gene modifies the clinical course of ASD. Patients with ASD and CFD exhibited high variability in folate metabolism markers. These findings underline the need for further research on folate transport genetics for personalized prevention and treatment strategies for ASD and CFD.

[PMID: 39571660] 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, MIM #607093) is a key enzyme in the folate cycle that catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF), a critical step for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease and the most common congenital defect in folate metabolism. A deficiency in MTHFR results in elevated serum homocysteine levels. In this study, we evaluated a patient diagnosed with epilepsy and elevated homocysteine levels, who carried compound heterozygous variants c.781-6G>A and c.1316T>C in the MTHFR gene. We primarily focused on the unreported non-canonical splicing variants c.781-6G>A in this patient and identified several complex splicing variant patterns. The c.1316T>C variant results in a substitution of leucine at position 439 with proline and this variant has been previously reported and is considered pathogenic. Our study mainly utilized RNA-seq and TA cloning to reveal the complex splicing patterns exhibited by this non-canonical splicing variant. Additionally, this finding was confirmed through in vitro experiments. This provided deeper insights into the underlying reasons for the patient's disease manifestation. Furthermore, despite apparently normal circulating folate and vitamin B12, we found two family members to exhibit mildly elevated homocysteine levels. While these individuals did not present overt clinical symptoms, the potential harm associated with high homocysteine levels should not be overlooked. This study not only provides additional genetic evidence for the clinical diagnosis of the patient but also broadens our understanding of the clinical manifestations of MTHFR deficiency.",3
A diminished ovarian reserve does not solely indicate infertility in an a priori non-infertile population.,diminished ovarian reserve AND infertility AND reduced ovarian reserve AND fertility potential,"40801036,40691107,40611296","[PMID: 40801036] This study compared pregnancy outcomes after frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) in infertile women aged <40 years with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) versus normal ovarian reserve (NOR), incorporating exploratory analysis of potential endometrial aging factors. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the data of 1,362 patients aged <40 years who underwent FET between January and December 2024. Patients were categorized into two groups: the DOR (anti-Müllerian hormone [AMH] < 1.1 ng/mL, n = 136) and NOR (AMH ≥ 1.1 ng/mL, n = 1,226) groups. Pregnancy outcomes were compared after adjusting for confounding factors using inverse probability weighting. Additionally, exploratory immunohistochemical analysis of p16 expression was performed using endometrial samples from 16 patients (n = 8 per group). After weighting, the clinical pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the DOR group than in the NOR group (47.0% vs. 58.3%, P = 0.040; odds ratio = 0.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.98). Exploratory analysis revealed that the expression of p16 was significantly higher in the endometrial cells of patients with DOR than in those of patients in the NOR group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, a trend toward lower clinical pregnancy rates was observed with higher p16 expression. These exploratory findings suggest that reduced pregnancy rates in young women with DOR may involve endometrial aging mechanisms; however, the preliminary nature and limited sample size for molecular analysis necessitate cautious interpretation and warrant validation in larger and well-controlled cohorts.

[PMID: 40691107] A growing body of evidence demonstrates that androgens play crucial roles in female reproductive physiology. Androgen receptor (AR) expression appears at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and other female reproductive organ or tissue such as uterus, placenta and immune system. Via AR-mediated mechanisms, androgens regulate key reproductive processes including follicular development, embryo implantation, placental formation, and pregnancy maintenance. AR knockout models suffer from considerable reproductive defects characterized by defective follicular development, reduced ovulation, decreased fertility, even premature ovarian failure. Clinically, low maternal serum testosterone correlates with diminished ovarian reserve and adverse pregnancy outcomes. These findings establish that a critical threshold of androgen is essential for successful pregnancy. While androgen excess has long been associated with follicular dysfunction and endometrial abnormalities leading to infertility and miscarriage, emerging evidence indicates that insufficient androgen similarly compromise female reproductive function. This review synthesizes fundamental discoveries and clinical evidence elucidating androgen's multifaceted effects on female reproduction. Collectively, we underscore the physiological significance of optimal androgen signaling and the pathological consequences from androgen deficiency across reproductive process.

[PMID: 40611296] Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), a common female disease, results in reduced fertility and menstrual disorders. Patients without timely treatment often suffer from infertility, ovarian insufficiency, premature ovarian failure and early onset or worsened perimenopausal symptoms caused by estrogen fluctuation or deficiency. However, there is a lack of effective methods to improve ovarian reserve function. Here, we report a case of a 13-year-old female with 2-year menstrual disorder. The anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels were test twice, with interval of 2 months, yielding results of 0.41 ng/mL and 0.50 ng/mL, respectively. Colour Doppler ultrasound examination showed that there were 4-6 antral follicles bilaterally. The patient was diagnosed with DOR. She was treated with Heyan Kuntai capsule (HYKT) combined with hormonal therapy (HT). Post treament, her AMH level, follicle stimulating hormone level and AFC normalized. Discontinuation of HYKT and continuation of HT alone for 5 months proved ineffective. Consequently, HYKT in combination with HT was continued, leading to normal ovarian reserve function restoration. No adverse reactions were observed during the 4-year follow-up. This case highlights the importance of including DOR as a diagnostic consideration in adolescents with menstrual disorders during clinical evaluation. AND combining HYKT with HT might contribute to potential improvements in ovarian function in DOR patients.",3
A high microerythrocyte count protects against severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.,Microerythrocyte AND Thalassemia AND Anemia severity AND Protective effect,"41187351,41187335,41187335","[PMID: 41187351] Epidemiological studies of large groups of nuclear industry workers offer a significant opportunity to increase our understanding of the long-term effects on health of the protracted accumulation of dose received at a low dose rate from many discrete exposures to ionising radiation. The effects of such extended aggregation of doses form an important part of the everyday concerns of radiological protection against low-level exposures. For more than half a century, databases of nuclear workers have been assembled, and the numbers of workers currently included in studies, together with the numbers of deaths among them that have now occurred, are capable of generating reasonably precise risk estimates that should provide meaningful comparisons with those obtained from other studies, such as of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, constructing, updating and maintaining these large databases, linking workers to occupational dose databases and to registers of deaths (and other outcomes, such as incident cancers) and their causes, and analyses of these data that endeavour to take account of other influential factors (such as smoking) are far from straightforward. A critical review of recent nuclear worker studies illustrates the difficulties in reliably interpreting reported statistical associations between rates of cancer and cumulative occupational doses because of the real possibility of distortions produced by biases, confounding and/or the interplay of radiation with other risk factors. This doesn't mean that studies of nuclear workers should be abandoned, far from it, but it does mean that appropriate effort needs to be expended on these studies before confident conclusions about the levels of risks from radiation exposure can be drawn from them. Unexpected findings should be examined in depth to gain a proper understanding of their origin, including the impact of doses from intakes of radionuclides upon dose-responses derived using doses from external sources of radiation.

[PMID: 41187335] DNA nanostructure-enabled functional constructs have shown potential to improve healthcare outcomes by offering advanced disease diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Translating this potential of DNA nanostructure-based constructs to real life applications relies on maintaining and enhancing the structural integrity and functions of the surface-anchored moieties. In this study, we explored the possibility of utilizing choline dihydrogen phosphate (CDHP) solution, an aqueous solution of ionic liquid, to assemble DNA nanostructures of different sizes and complexities with enhanced biostability and ligand binding affinity. We show successful formation of the DNA nanostructures in aqueous CDHP solution using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and circular dichroism (CD). Biostability assays reveal that the aqueous CDHP solution may provide passive protection to DNA nanostructures against DNase I and human serum for up to 48 h. We also demonstrate that this enhanced biostability arises both from the structural conformation imparted during CDHP-mediated folding and from the presence of free CDHP ions in the solution. Notably, removal of free ions reduced the passive protection effect, but did not eliminate it, indicating the contribution of both folding and surrounding free ions. Using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we show that the presence of aqueous CDHP solution can enhance the binding of aptamer-functionalized DNA nanostructures to specific receptors on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Our strategy of using ionic liquid solution for one-pot preparation with enhanced stability and functionality offers a robust, simpler and faster alternative for DNA nanostructure-based constructs.

A mutation in HNF4A leads to an increased risk of developing diabetes by the age of 14 years.,HNF4A mutation AND diabetes AND genetic predisposition AND pediatric,"33251707,27486234,33565752","[PMID: 33251707] Heterozygous pathogenic variants in HNF4A cause hyperinsulinism, maturity onset diabetes of the young type 1, and more rarely Fanconi renotubular syndrome. Specifically, the recurrent missense pathogenic variant c.253C>T (p.Arg85Trp) has been associated with a syndromic form of hyperinsulinism with additional features of macrosomia, renal tubular nephropathy, hypophosphatemic rickets, and liver involvement. We present an affected mother, who had been previously diagnosed clinically with the autosomal recessive Fanconi Bickel Syndrome, and her affected son. The son's presentation expands the clinical phenotype to include multiple congenital anomalies, including penile chordee with hypospadias and coloboma. This specific pathogenic variant should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Fanconi Bickel Syndrome when genetics are negative or the family history is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance. The inclusion of hyperinsulinism and maturity onset of the diabetes of the young changes the management of this syndrome and the recurrence risk is distinct. Additionally, this family also emphasizes the importance of genetic confirmation of clinical diagnoses, especially in adults who grew up in the premolecular era that are now coming to childbearing age. Finally, the expansion of the phenotype to include multiple congenital anomalies suggests that the full spectrum of HNF4A is likely unknown.

[PMID: 27486234] HNF4A mutations cause increased birth weight, transient neonatal hypoglycemia, and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The most frequently reported HNF4A mutation is p.R114W (previously p.R127W), but functional studies have shown inconsistent results; there is a lack of cosegregation in some pedigrees and an unexpectedly high frequency in public variant databases. We confirm that p.R114W is a pathogenic mutation with an odds ratio of 30.4 (95% CI 9.79-125, P = 2 × 10(-21)) for diabetes in our MODY cohort compared with control subjects. p.R114W heterozygotes did not have the increased birth weight of patients with other HNF4A mutations (3,476 g vs. 4,147 g, P = 0.0004), and fewer patients responded to sulfonylurea treatment (48% vs. 73%, P = 0.038). p.R114W has reduced penetrance; only 54% of heterozygotes developed diabetes by age 30 years compared with 71% for other HNF4A mutations. We redefine p.R114W as a pathogenic mutation that causes a distinct clinical subtype of HNF4A MODY with reduced penetrance, reduced sensitivity to sulfonylurea treatment, and no effect on birth weight. This has implications for diabetes treatment, management of pregnancy, and predictive testing of at-risk relatives. The increasing availability of large-scale sequence data is likely to reveal similar examples of rare, low-penetrance MODY mutations.

[PMID: 33565752] The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular basis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) by targeted-gene sequencing of 20 genes related to monogenic diabetes, estimate the frequency and describe the clinical characteristics of monogenic diabetes and MODY in the Trakya Region of Turkey. A panel of 20 monogenic diabetes related genes were screened in 61 cases. Illumina NextSeq550 system was used for sequencing. Pathogenicity of the variants were assessed by bioinformatics prediction software programs and segregation analyses. In 29 (47.5%) cases, 31 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the <i>GCK, ABCC8, KCNJ11, HNF1A, HNF4A</i> genes and in 11 (18%) cases, 14 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the <i>GCK, RFX6, CEL, PDX1, KCNJ11, HNF1A, G6PC2, GLIS3</i> and <i>KLF11</i> genes were identified. There were six different pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and six different VUS which were novel. This is the first study including molecular studies of twenty monogenic diabetes genes in Turkish cases in the Trakya Region. The results showed that pathogenic variants in the <i>GCK</i> gene are the leading cause of MODY in our population. A high frequency of novel variants (32.4%-12/37) in the current study, suggests that multiple gene analysis provides accurate genetic diagnosis in MODY.",3
A single nucleotide variant the gene DGKK is strongly associated with increased risk of hypospadias.,hypospadias AND single nucleotide variant AND DGKK gene AND risk association,"40335670,25327554,21113153","[PMID: 40335670] X-chromosome variants contribute significantly to hypospadias risk but have not been fully elucidated in the Chinese population. Here we aim to assess how X-chromosome variants contribute to hypospadias susceptibility in the Chinese population. We recruited 1,073 boys with hypospadias and 5,150 controls in a southern Chinese population. Single-variant and gene/pathway-based association analyses were conducted for the distal and proximal hypospadias. Haplotype analysis was performed on top susceptibility genes. Additionally, we performed a multi-ancestral comparison between the East Asian and European populations. We performed an X-chromosome-wide association study on 987 patients and 4,761 controls that met quality control standards. We confirmed DGKK variants as multi-ancestral susceptibility loci for distal hypospadias (lead SNP: rs5961181, P = 1.82 × 10<sup>- 7</sup>), but not for the proximal subtype. Distinct association signals were identified for distal hypospadias (DGKK-CCNB3-AKAP4, PNPLA4, AR-OPHN1, TAF7L, IL1RAPL1) and proximal hypospadias (SMIM10L2A, PRR32 and Xq28 gene cluster). Pathway analysis revealed that distal hypospadias is associated with male gamete generation, epithelial cell polarity, and lipid/sterol metabolism, while proximal hypospadias is linked to amino acid metabolism and gastrulation. Except for DGKK, all candidate genes showed population-favored associations compared to European studies. Haplotype analysis of DGKK, PNPLA4, OPHN1 and IL1RAPL1 showed increased risk for specific risk haplotypes (OR ranged from 4.35 to 6.25). Our findings highlight the importance of X chromosome variants in hypospadias etiology and reveal subtype- and population-specific genetic architecture. Our results improve the understanding of genetic susceptibility for hypospadias risk and provide insights into risk prediction and personalized prevention strategies in hypospadias management.

[PMID: 25327554] To investigate whether diacylglycerol kinase κ (DGKK) is a susceptibility gene for hypospadias in the Han Chinese population as has been suggested by previous publications. A case-control study involving 466 patients with hypospadias and 402 healthy subjects was conducted to assess the relationship between DGKK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and hypospadias risk in the Han Chinese population. The 466 hypospadias patients were further divided into mild, moderate and severe subgroups for analysis. Six SNPs (rs1934179, rs4143304, rs9969978, rs1934188, rs4826632 and rs4599945) were marginally associated with mild and moderate hypospadias [odds ratios (ORs) > 1, P = 0.05 to P < 0.1), whereas no significant relationship was seen with the severe cases (ORs >1, P > 0.1). After correcting for multiple testing, it was determined that neither individual SNPs nor individual haplotypes were associated with hypospadias. To evaluate this relationship in multiple populations, we performed a meta-analysis on six SNPs, using combined data from our present results and those of previous studies of different races (including 1966 patients and 2492 controls). Six SNPs (rs1934179, rs4143304, rs9969978, rs1934188, rs7063116 and rs1934190) were significantly associated with mild/moderate hypospadias (ORs >1, P < 0.05), and rs1934179 was significantly associated with severe hypospadias (OR > 1, P < 0.05). DGKK gene variants do not appear to play a major role in hypospadias susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. Our meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that DGKK is a common risk gene for hypospadias, particularly in cases of mild or moderate hypospadias in Caucasian populations.

[PMID: 21113153] Hypospadias is a common congenital malformation of the male external genitalia. We performed a genome-wide association study using pooled DNA from 436 individuals with hypospadias (cases) and 494 controls of European descent and selected the highest ranked SNPs for individual genotyping in the discovery sample, an additional Dutch sample of 133 cases and their parents, and a Swedish series of 266 cases and 402 controls. Individual genotyping of two SNPs (rs1934179 and rs7063116) in DGKK, encoding diacylglycerol kinase κ, produced compelling evidence for association with hypospadias in the discovery sample (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, P = 2.5 × 10⁻¹¹ and OR = 2.3, P = 2.9 × 10⁻⁹, respectively) and in the Dutch (OR = 3.9, P = 2.4 × 10⁻⁵ and OR = 3.8, P = 3.4 × 10⁻⁵) and Swedish (OR = 2.5, P = 2.6 × 10⁻⁸ and OR = 2.2, P = 2.7 × 10⁻⁶) replication samples. Expression studies showed expression of DGKK in preputial tissue of cases and controls, which was lower in carriers of the risk allele of rs1934179 (P = 0.047). We propose DGKK as a major risk gene for hypospadias.",3
A strong bias in the phage genome locations where the spacers were derived has been observed in many CRISPR subtypes that confer the immunity to phage.,CRISPR AND spacer acquisition AND phage genome location AND CRISPR subtype diversity,"30905291,30157725,41186426","[PMID: 30905291] We investigated the diversity of CRISPR spacers of Thermus communities from two locations in Italy, two in Chile and one location in Russia. Among the five sampling sites, a total of more than 7200 unique spacers belonging to different CRISPR-Cas systems types and subtypes were identified. Most of these spacers are not found in CRISPR arrays of sequenced Thermus strains. Comparison of spacer sets revealed that samples within the same area (separated by few to hundreds of metres) have similar spacer sets, which appear to be largely stable at least over the course of several years. While at further distances (hundreds of kilometres and more) the similarity of spacer sets is decreased, there are still multiple common spacers in Thermus communities from different continents. The common spacers can be reconstructed in identical or similar CRISPR arrays, excluding their independent appearance and suggesting an extensive migration of thermophilic bacteria over long distances. Several new Thermus phages were isolated in the sampling sites. Mapping of spacers to bacteriophage sequences revealed examples of local acquisition of spacers from some phages and distinct patterns of targeting of phage genomes by different CRISPR-Cas systems. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The ecology and evolution of prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems'.

[PMID: 30157725] CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against invading genetic elements, such as plasmids, bacteriophages and archaeal viruses. They consist of cas genes and CRISPR loci, which store genetic memories of previously encountered invaders as short sequences termed spacers. Spacers determine the specificity of CRISPR-Cas defence and immunity can be gained or updated by the addition of new spacers into CRISPR loci. There are two main routes to spacer acquisition, which are known as naïve and primed CRISPR adaptation. Naïve CRISPR adaptation involves the de novo formation of immunity, independent of pre-existing spacers. In contrast, primed CRISPR adaptation (priming) uses existing spacers to enhance the acquisition of new spacers. Priming typically results in spacer acquisition from locations near the site of target recognition by the existing (priming) spacer. Primed CRISPR adaptation has been observed in several type I CRISPR-Cas systems and it is potentially widespread. However, experimental evidence is unavailable for some subtypes, and for most systems, priming has only been shown in a small number of hosts. There is also no current evidence of priming by other CRISPR-Cas types. Here, we used a bioinformatic approach to search for evidence of priming in diverse CRISPR-Cas systems. By analysing the clustering of spacers acquired from phages, prophages and archaeal viruses, including strand and directional biases between subsequently acquired spacers, we demonstrate that two patterns of primed CRISPR adaptation dominate in type I systems. In addition, we find evidence of a priming-like pathway in type II CRISPR-Cas systems.

[PMID: 41186426] There has been a resurgence and ongoing outbreak of avian influenza since early 2024. Avian influenza, caused by influenza A viruses, poses significant threats to both avian populations and public health due to its zoonotic potential. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, such as the H5N1 and H7 subtypes, has a high mortality rate. Traditional detection methods, i.e., virus isolation and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), are reliable for diagnosis but time-consuming and labor-intensive. Rapid and accurate detection of avian influenza A viruses is crucial to prevent widespread outbreaks and minimize economic losses. Field-ready and point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, such as lateral flow assays (LFAs) offer a rapid, early, and large-scale approach for detecting avian influenza A virus infections. Early detection in HPAI management is a key factor in improving treatment effectiveness and reducing the negative impact on animal health. This minireview introduces the principles and techniques of current field-ready and POC diagnostics, emphasizing LFAs for HPAI detection. It also outlines and compares their development, applications, and availability in the market. Notably, advanced techniques such as LFAs-integrated clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) have expanded HPAI diagnostic capabilities and have also been reviewed. CRISPR-based LFAs use guide RNA to detect viral sequences, activating Cas enzymes that generate a visible signal on test strips, enabling a rapid and sensitive detection method. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review summarizing LFA-based HPAI diagnostics in the context of the 2024 resurgence, offering timely insight into their potential roles in outbreak preparedness and response.",3
ALDH1 expression is associated with poorer prognosis for breast cancer primary tumors.,ALDH1 AND expression AND breast cancer AND prognosis,"41179319,40943144,40414980","[PMID: 41179319] The role of catenin β interacting protein 1 (<i>CTNNBIP1</i>), a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, in luminal A and B breast cancer stem cells treated with hormone therapy is unknown. This study investigated the relationship between <i>CTNNBIP1</i> and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A3 (<i>ALDH1A3</i>) expression and its impact on disease-specific survival in luminal A and B breast cancer. Given that high protein kinase ζ (<i>PKCζ</i>) expression, together with elevated <i>CTNNBIP1</i> or <i>ALDH1A3</i>, is linked to poor prognosis in luminal B tumors, we also examined their combined influence.

[PMID: 40943144] Multiple markers exist for breast cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are believed to represent the phenotypes of various CSC types and/or states. The relationship between each CSC subpopulation/state and the primary hallmarks of cancer has not been sufficiently clarified. In this study, six CSC markers (CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>, CD24, Ep-CAM, ALDH1, CD10, and BMI1) were assessed in a surgical cohort of 73 breast cancer patients. The expression of a single or multiple CSC markers was correlated with clinicopathological parameters, including markers of immune evasion, proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and survival. All CSC phenotypes, except for CD10, correlated with markers indicative of higher proliferation. The CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup> phenotype correlated with markers of EMT and PD-L1 expression, unlike ALDH1<sup>hi</sup>. Both Ep-CAM<sup>hi</sup> and CD24<sup>hi</sup> breast cancer were associated with indicators of immune evasion, including PD-L1 expression, and the infiltration of FOXP3+ and PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). While the CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>, Ep-CAM<sup>hi</sup>, and ALDH1<sup>hi</sup> phenotypes correlated with shorter overall survival (OS), CD24<sup>hi</sup> correlated with reduced disease-free survival (DFS). Interestingly, among all tested CSC markers, the CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>-ALDH1<sup>hi</sup> combination phenotype correlated with the worst DFS (HR 2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.014 in univariate/multivariate analysis) and OS (<i>p</i> < 0.001, HR 6.4 in univariate and 5.4 in multivariate analysis). A side-by-side comparison of multiple CSC markers demonstrated the differential linkage of CSC phenotype/state with distinct features of breast cancer. This comparison demonstrates the advantage of the CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>-ALDH1<sup>hi</sup> combination marker for prognostication, especially after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the future, distinct markers of CSCs can hopefully be leveraged to trace/monitor different disease characteristics or treatment outcomes.

[PMID: 40414980] Interleukin-33 (IL-33) plays multifaceted roles in tumor progression, but its autocrine regulation of breast cancer stemness and metastasis via the Wnt pathway remains unclear. Here, we investigated the IL-33/ST2 axis in breast cancer using CRISPR/Cas9, single-cell RNA sequencing, and murine models (orthotopic 4T1 and spontaneous MMTV-PyMT). Elevated IL-33 levels correlated with aggressive subtypes and poor prognosis. IL-33 overexpression enhanced proliferation, migration, and cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression (CD44, ALDH1) in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas ST2 knockdown via CRISPR or adeno-associated virus (AAV) attenuated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, reducing CSC frequency. Mechanistically, IL-33 activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote stemness, which was reversed by the Wnt inhibitor XAV-939. Single-cell analysis revealed that IL-33 overexpression skewed the immune microenvironment toward immunosuppression, while ST2 knockdown restored antitumor immunity. Our findings establish an IL-33-Wnt axis as a critical driver of breast cancer aggressiveness and propose AAV-mediated ST2 silencing as a novel therapeutic strategy. Targeting this axis may offer dual benefits by suppressing stemness and enhancing immune surveillance, warranting clinical exploration for advanced breast cancer.",3
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation reduces inflammation-related fibrosis in the lungs.,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) AND activation AND inflammation-related fibrosis AND lung,31302199,"[PMID: 31302199] Mineralocorticoid receptor activation of the epithelial sodium channel in endothelial cells (ECs) (EnNaC) is accompanied by aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated arterial relaxation. Recent data support enhanced activity of the alpha subunit of EnNaC (αEnNaC) mediates this aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and associated endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation. There is mounting evidence that diet induced obesity diminishes expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which would be expected to lead to impaired downstream eNOS activation. Thereby, we posited that enhanced EnNaC activation contributes to diet induced obesity related increases in stiffness of the endothelium and diminished NO mediated vascular relaxation by increasing oxidative stress and related inhibition of AMPKα, Sirt1, and associated eNOS inactivation. Sixteen to twenty week-old αEnNaC knockout (αEnNaC<sup>-/-</sup>) and wild type littermate (EnNaC<sup>+/+</sup>) female mice were fed a mouse chow or an obesogenic western diet (WD) containing excess fat (46%) and fructose (17.5%) for 16 weeks. Sodium currents of ECs, endothelial stiffness and NO mediated aortic relaxation were examined along with indices of aortic oxidative stress, vascular remodeling and fibrosis. Enhanced EnNaC activation-mediated WD-induced increases in sodium currents in isolated lung ECs, increased endothelial stiffness and impaired aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (10<sup>-9</sup>-10<sup>-4</sup> mol/L). These abnormalities occurred in conjunction with WD-mediated aortic tissue oxidative stress, inflammation, and decreased activation of AMPKα, Sirt1, and downstream eNOS were substantially mitigated in αEnNaC<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Importantly, αEnNaC<sup>-/-</sup> prevented WD induced increases in endothelial stiffness and related impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation as well as aortic fibrosis and remodeling. However, EnNaC signaling was not involved in diet-induced abnormal expression of adipokines and CYP11b2 in abdominal aortic perivascular adipose tissue. These data suggest that endothelial specific EnNaC activation mediates WD-induced endothelial stiffness, impaired eNOS activation, aortic fibrosis and remodeling through increased aortic oxidative stress and increased inflammation related to a reduction of AMPKα and Sirt 1 mediated eNOS phosphorylation/activation and NO production.",1
ART substantially reduces infectiveness of HIV-positive people.,ART AND HIV AND transmission reduction AND HIV infectivity,"41063233,40666737,40642734","[PMID: 41063233] This study examines the prevalence of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Mizoram, Northeast India, with a focus on age-group transmission routes and gender-specific prevalence. According to data from the ART Plus Centre at Civil Hospital Aizawl (January-December 2023), men were more likely to be infected with HIV, with the 26-35 age group being the most affected. Heterosexual transmission and intravenous drug use (IDU) were shown to be the most common modes of transmission. Gender and age variations were identified by statistical analysis using SPSS<sup>®</sup> (V 27.0), highlighting the need for focused interventions. To effectively combat the HIV epidemic in this area, gender-specific policies, harm reduction strategies, and stigma reduction measures are essential.

[PMID: 40666737] Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. The virus disrupts maternal-fetal immunity through immune dysregulation, placental barrier impairment, and altered antibody transfer, thereby increasing the risk of vertical transmission. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the immunological and clinical factors influencing MTCT. It highlights how maternal immune exhaustion, placental inflammation, and suboptimal ART timing contribute to transmission. While widespread use of ART has reduced MTCT rates, persistent challenges include late ART initiation, HIV drug resistance, co-infections, and transmission through breastfeeding. Emerging strategies-such as maternal immune modulation, monoclonal antibody therapies, and tailored ART regimens-show potential for further risk reduction. To effectively minimize MTCT, comprehensive prevention approaches are essential. These should combine medical interventions with maternal nutrition support, co-infection management, and safe breastfeeding practices under ART coverage. A multifaceted strategy is key to protecting both maternal and infant health.

[PMID: 40642734] People who inject drugs (PWID) face a significantly higher risk of HIV infection than the general population. Effective prevention for this group depends on combining several strategies: needle and syringe programs (NSPs), opioid agonist therapy (OAT), antiretroviral therapy (ART), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), overdose prevention, and changes to structural and policy environments. This narrative review draws on evidence published between 2000 and 2024, including systematic reviews, clinical trials, surveillance reports, and global health guidelines. Programs that offer high coverage of NSPs and OAT have consistently been shown to reduce HIV incidence. ART helps lower viral load and prevents transmission, while both daily and long-acting PrEP offer additional protection for those at risk. However, access remains limited, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, due to criminalization, stigma, and a lack of investment in harm reduction services. Outcomes vary widely by region. In places like Portugal and Canada, where policies support decriminalization and integrate harm reduction into routine care, HIV incidence among PWID has dropped significantly. In contrast, countries that maintain punitive drug laws, such as Russia, continue to struggle with sustained epidemics. Reducing HIV transmission in this population will require expanding access to proven interventions, integrating services more effectively, and reforming policies that act as barriers to care. Priorities moving forward include scaling up NSP and OAT, addressing gender-based inequities, reducing stigma, and aligning national policies with international harm reduction standards.",3
Activated Cdk5 phosphorylates the ATM protein in response to DNA damage.,Cdk5 AND ATM protein AND phosphorylation AND DNA damage,"28477132,25928429,19151707","[PMID: 28477132] The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) plays a central role in coordinating the DNA damage responses including cell cycle checkpoint control, DNA repair, and apoptosis.

We previously showed that Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) is activated by DNA damage and directly phosphorylates ATM at serine 794 in postmitotic neurons. Phosphorylation at serine 794 precedes and is required for ATM autophosphorylation at serine 1981, and activates ATM kinase activity. Cdk5-ATM pathway plays a crucial role in DNA damage-induced neuronal injury. This chapter describes protocols used in analyzing ATM phosphorylation by Cdk5 in CGNs (cerebellar granule neurons) and its effects on neuronal survival.

[PMID: 25928429] Previous study revealed that the protective effect of TIGAR in cell survival is mediated through the increase in PPP (pentose phosphate pathway) flux. However, it remains unexplored if TIGAR plays an important role in DNA damage and repair. This study investigated the role of TIGAR in DNA damage response (DDR) induced by genotoxic drugs and hypoxia in tumor cells. Results showed that TIGAR was increased and relocated to the nucleus after epirubicin or hypoxia treatment in cancer cells. Knockdown of TIGAR exacerbated DNA damage and the effects were partly reversed by the supplementation of PPP products NADPH, ribose, or the ROS scavenger NAC. Further studies with pharmacological and genetic approaches revealed that TIGAR regulated the phosphorylation of ATM, a key protein in DDR, through Cdk5. The Cdk5-AMT signal pathway involved in regulation of DDR by TIGAR defines a new role of TIGAR in cancer cell survival and it suggests that TIGAR may be a therapeutic target for cancers.

Activated Cdk5 regulates DNA damage-induced neuronal death.,Cdk5 AND regulation AND DNA damage AND neuronal death,"21057871,19151707,17611284","[PMID: 21057871] Recently, it was reported that in a 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model, neuronal cell death is associated with the cdk5-mediated hyperphosphorylation of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), a transcription factor that is critically required for neuronal survival. In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of cdk5-mediated MEF2D down-regulation on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PC12 cell death. 6-OHDA was found to significantly increase nitric oxide (NO) production and to induce apoptosis in a time-dependent manner in PC12 cells. Furthermore, 6-OHDA was found to markedly reduce MEF2D levels under conditions that could induce PC12 cell apoptosis. In addition, PC12 cell death and MEF2D degradation by 6-OHDA were prevented by the cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine, but roscovitine could not restore the 6-OHDA-induced inactivation of Akt. These results suggest that the cell death and MEF2D degradation caused by 6-OHDA are dependent on cdk5 activity. On the other hand, roscovitine enhanced the 6-OHDA-induced activations of ERK1/2 and JNK, but reduced the 6-OHDA-induced activation of p38. These results suggest that PC12 cell death by 6-OHDA appears to be regulated by the down-regulation of MEF2D via some interaction between cdk5 and MAP kinase.

[PMID: 17611284] Huntingtin is an antiapoptotic protein that becomes toxic when its polyglutamine stretch is expanded, resulting in Huntington's disease (HD). Protein context and posttranslational modifications regulate huntingtin toxicity. Identifying signaling pathways that act on huntingtin is, therefore, key to understanding huntingtin function in normal and pathological conditions. We show here that huntingtin is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at serines 1181 and 1201. Phosphorylation can be induced by DNA damage in vitro and in vivo. The state of huntingtin phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of neuronal cell death. Absence of phosphorylation of huntingtin at serines 1181 and 1201 confers toxic properties to wild-type huntingtin in a p53-dependent manner in striatal neurons and accelerates neuronal death induced by DNA damage. In contrast, phosphorylation at serines 1181 and 1201 protects against polyQ-induced toxicity. Finally, we show in late stages of HD a sustained DNA damage that is associated with a decrease in Cdk5/p35 levels. We propose that wild-type huntingtin is a component of the DNA damage response signal in neurons and that the Cdk5/DNA damage pathway is dysregulated in HD.",3

Brefeldin A stimulated significant ER stress in mouse skin melanoma cells, but rapamycin contributed to the maintenance of cell homeostasis by inducing autophagy, which was confirmed by the presence of autophagy-related structures and significantly smaller sizes of the rough ER cisterns in the group of mice receiving both rapamycin and brefeldin A. Brefeldin A-induced ER stress triggered apoptosis of tumor cells. Moreover, simultaneous stimulation of autophagy and ER stress in tumor cells promoted cytoprotective selective autophagy (reticulophagy) aimed at resolving ER stress, which may be a mechanism underlying the development of chemoresistance in skin melanoma.

[PMID: 24625979] Apoptotic cell death is an integral part of cell turnover in many tissues, and proper corpse clearance is vital to maintaining tissue homeostasis in all multicellular organisms. Even in tissues with high cellular turnover, apoptotic cells are rarely seen because of efficient clearance mechanisms in healthy individuals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, two parallel and partly redundant conserved pathways act in cell corpse engulfment. The pathway for cytoskeletal rearrangement requires the small GTPase CED-10 Rac1 acting for an efficient surround of the dead cell. The CED-10 Rac pathway is also required for the proper migration of the distal tip cells (DTCs) during the development of the C. elegans gonad. Parkin, the mammalian homolog of the C. elegans PDR-1, interacts with Rac1 in aged human brain and it is also implicated with actin dynamics and cytoskeletal rearrangements in Parkinsons's disease, suggesting that it might act on engulfment. Our genetic and biochemical studies indicate that PDR-1 inhibits apoptotic cell engulfment and DTC migration by ubiquitylating CED-10 for degradation.

Active Ly49Q induces neutrophil polarization.,Active Ly49Q AND Ly49Q receptor AND neutrophil polarization AND immune response,"29712775,20153219","[PMID: 29712775] Pulmonary infection is a frequent pathology associated with excessive neutrophil infiltration. Ly49Q, an ITIM domain-bearing receptor expressed on different leukocytes, has been recently reported to impact neutrophil migration and polarization. Utilizing a murine model of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae-</i>induced pulmonary infection in combination with additional in vivo and in vitro assays, we show that Ly49Q is critically involved in different steps of the leukocyte adhesion cascade. Ly49Q deficiency is associated with a reduced rolling velocity, impaired crawling capacity, and diminished transmigration. We show that overactivation of the neutrophil β<sub>2</sub> integrins Mac-1 and LFA-1 is responsible for increased adhesion and reduced neutrophil transmigration, resulting in a strongly impaired immune defense against pulmonary infection. Structure function analysis in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that different domains of Ly49Q are important for its function. In summary, Ly49Q regulates integrin activation and neutrophil recruitment and is required for an adequate immune response in pulmonary infection.

[PMID: 20153219] Neutrophils rapidly undergo polarization and directional movement to infiltrate the sites of infection and inflammation. Here, we show that an inhibitory MHC I receptor, Ly49Q, was crucial for the swift polarization of and tissue infiltration by neutrophils. During the steady state, Ly49Q inhibited neutrophil adhesion by preventing focal-complex formation, likely by inhibiting Src and PI3 kinases. However, in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, Ly49Q mediated rapid neutrophil polarization and tissue infiltration in an ITIM-domain-dependent manner. These opposite functions appeared to be mediated by distinct use of effector phosphatase SHP-1 and SHP-2. Ly49Q-dependent polarization and migration were affected by Ly49Q regulation of membrane raft functions. We propose that Ly49Q is pivotal in switching neutrophils to their polarized morphology and rapid migration upon inflammation, through its spatiotemporal regulation of membrane rafts and raft-associated signaling molecules.",2

This study aims to reveal the intrinsic role mechanism of sustainable transformation of pharmaceutical enterprises in high-quality innovation development. Based on the relevant data of China's A-share pharmaceutical listed companies from 2015 to 2022, the study establishes a fixed effect model and a mediation effect model, empirically examines the impact of ESG performance on the innovation of pharmaceutical listed companies, and deeply explores the role mechanism of R&D personnel investment and government subsidies in it. The study finds that: (1) ESG performance significantly enhances firms' innovation inputs and green innovation outputs; (2) this facilitating effect is more substantial among non-state-owned firms and firms in the eastern region; (3) good ESG performance has a more pronounced facilitating effect on innovation inputs of large firms, while it has a more prominent effect on the green innovation outputs of small and medium-sized firms; and (4) the mechanism analysis indicates that internal R&D personnel investment and external government subsidies play a significant mediating effect between ESG performance and corporate innovation. This study provides new empirical evidence for understanding the mechanism of ESG performance on corporate innovation in Chinese pharmaceutical companies. It provides theoretical support for proactively promoting the sustainable transformation and deepening the development of green innovation in Chinese pharmaceutical companies. In addition, there are important policy implications for promoting the sustainable transformation of pharmaceutical companies: the establishment of differentiated ESG incentive policies, the improvement of R&D talent training mechanisms, and the optimization of government subsidy allocations, focusing on supporting green innovation by companies with excellent ESG performance.

[PMID: 41186780] The widespread use of pesticides such as deltamethrin (a pyrethroid) and acetamiprid (a neonicotinoid) has sparked concerns regarding their effects on human health, particularly their potential role in carcinogenesis. This study investigated the cytotoxic, molecular, and functional effects of these pesticides, individually and in combination, on the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line. This model was chosen to specifically investigate estrogen recpetor (ER)-independent mechanisms due to its expression of targets such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER); however, it does not reflect normal mammary cell responses. Cytotoxicity was assessed via XTT assays, migration was analyzed using wound-healing assays, and gene expression changes in AhR, PPARγ, and Caspase-3 were measured using RT-qPCR. Molecular docking was performed to predict pesticide-protein interactions, and in silico toxicity assessments using ProTox-II supplemented the in vitro results by predicting toxicity profiles relevant to public health. Both pesticides exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity, and their combination produced an additive effect on cell viability. Importantly, suppression of cell migration and downregulation of AhR and PPARγ expression reflected toxic stress responses at high pesticide concentrations, rather than therapeutic or anti-cancer potential. While apoptosis-related gene expression (Caspase-3) was increased, this effect did not reach statistical significance. Molecular docking supported strong interactions with key pathways related to xenobiotic metabolism and apoptosis. These findings emphasize that, at high and non-environmentally relevant concentrations, deltamethrin and acetamiprid induce additive cytotoxic effects and disrupt molecular processes in a mechanistic cancer model. The results highlight the need for further investigation using normal cell systems and environmentally relevant exposures to clarify real-world risk and biological mechanisms, and should not be interpreted as evidence of therapeutic activity. This study underscores the mechanistic relevance of pesticide exposure in environmental toxicology rather than any potential therapeutic application.

[PMID: 41187121] Environmental, social and governance performance is an important driver for companies to achieve innovative and high-quality development, and the relationship between sustainable development and corporate innovation is one of the key concerns of pharmaceutical companies. This study aims to reveal the intrinsic role mechanism of sustainable transformation of pharmaceutical enterprises in high-quality innovation development. Based on the relevant data of China's A-share pharmaceutical listed companies from 2015 to 2022, the study establishes a fixed effect model and a mediation effect model, empirically examines the impact of ESG performance on the innovation of pharmaceutical listed companies, and deeply explores the role mechanism of R&D personnel investment and government subsidies in it. The study finds that: (1) ESG performance significantly enhances firms' innovation inputs and green innovation outputs; (2) this facilitating effect is more substantial among non-state-owned firms and firms in the eastern region; (3) good ESG performance has a more pronounced facilitating effect on innovation inputs of large firms, while it has a more prominent effect on the green innovation outputs of small and medium-sized firms; and (4) the mechanism analysis indicates that internal R&D personnel investment and external government subsidies play a significant mediating effect between ESG performance and corporate innovation. This study provides new empirical evidence for understanding the mechanism of ESG performance on corporate innovation in Chinese pharmaceutical companies. It provides theoretical support for proactively promoting the sustainable transformation and deepening the development of green innovation in Chinese pharmaceutical companies. In addition, there are important policy implications for promoting the sustainable transformation of pharmaceutical companies: the establishment of differentiated ESG incentive policies, the improvement of R&D talent training mechanisms, and the optimization of government subsidy allocations, focusing on supporting green innovation by companies with excellent ESG performance.",3
Active caspase-11 protein promotes pyroptosis.,Caspase-11 AND Promotes AND Pyroptosis AND Scientific Articles,"40827894,40028711","[PMID: 40827894] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a severe pulmonary condition characterized by widespread alveolar injury and inflammatory cascade activation. While alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells are recognized as critical mediators in ARDS pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms underlying their dysfunction remain incompletely understood. This study investigated the regulatory role of the P2rx7-Panx1 signaling axis in orchestrating alveolar macrophage pyroptosis and subsequent exosome-mediated ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS. The study utilized both an in vivo ARDS mouse model and in vitro systems comprising MH-S alveolar macrophages and MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells. P2rx7-Panx1 interaction was characterized through Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation studies. The functional consequences of P2rx7 and Panx1 depletion were assessed through comprehensive analyses of cell viability, inflammatory cytokine profiles, oxidative stress parameters, and protein expression patterns. LPS exposure induced significant upregulation and enhanced interaction of P2rx7 and Panx1 in alveolar macrophages both in vivo and in vitro. Selective knockdown of either P2rx7 or Panx1 significantly attenuated LPS-induced macrophage pyroptosis, as evidenced by reduced cell death, diminished NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 activation, and decreased IL-1β/IL-18 secretion, with dual knockdown exhibiting synergistic protection. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated macrophages induced ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells through P2rx7-dependent exosome release, while P2rx7 blockade effectively prevented this exosome-mediated epithelial cell ferroptosis. This study elucidates a novel mechanism whereby the P2rx7-Panx1 axis synergistically regulates LPS-induced alveolar macrophage pyroptosis through caspase-11-dependent pathways. Moreover, P2rx7 functions as a critical modulator of exosome release from alveolar macrophages, thereby promoting ferroptotic death of alveolar epithelial cells. These findings identify the P2rx7-Panx1 signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target in ARDS treatment.

[PMID: 40028711] Endothelial pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory programmed cell death, promotes endothelial inflammation and is a pivotal process in the initial stage of acute lung injury (ALI). Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a gasotransmitter primarily dependent on cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, plays a protective role during ALI. Nonetheless, the modulatory role and precise molecular mechanism of endothelial endogenous CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S in the pathogenesis of ALI remain elusive. Herein, we prepared an ALI mouse model using intratracheal administration of LPS (5 mg/kg), and lung injury was assessed by evaluating pulmonary edema, inflammatory response, and endothelial pyroptosis. In this model, H<sub>2</sub>S production from pulmonary tissues declined in a time-dependent manner, accompanied by a compensatory elevation of CSE protein levels. Treatment with the H<sub>2</sub>S donor (NaHS) attenuated pulmonary edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, endothelial pyroptosis, and reduced serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Meanwhile, the inducible deletion of CSE in endothelial cells exacerbated these changes. The blocking effect of CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S on endothelial pyroptosis (evidenced by caspase-11 activation and GSDMD-NT formation) was also confirmed in cultured pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs). Mechanistically, H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated regulation of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) expression and activation (via sulfhydration) contributed to the modulatory process. Collectively, we uncovered that endothelial endogenous CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S alleviates endothelial pyroptosis by activating SIRT1, thereby preventing LPS-induced acute lung injury.",2

The development of an in vitro endometrial cell culture system that mimics in vivo architecture, cellular morphology, and physiological responses would facilitate a greater understanding of the mechanisms of complex canine uterine diseases and reduce the need for in vivo research. Three-dimensional organoid cell cultures may provide an innovative approach for studying uterine pathologies in the bitch. Unlike traditional two-dimensional monolayer cell culture systems, organoids can be grown long-term whilst maintaining the structure, phenotype, and function of their organ of origin. Here we report the generation and characterization of canine endometrial organoids via immunohistochemistry (IHC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and RT-qPCR and demonstrate their responsiveness to exogenous steroid hormones mimicking the estrous cycle. Furthermore, gene expression of key inflammatory markers was upregulated in endometrial organoids derived from bitches with CEH compared to organoids derived from healthy tissue. Findings highlight canine endometrial organoids as a valuable model to study both normal uterine physiology and disease-related processes in dogs. Organoids are cells that are grown three-dimensionally in the laboratory that retain similar functions to the organ from which the cells were collected. Organoids were used here to study the female dog reproductive tissue without the need for live animals, which saves time and money and improves animal welfare. We developed a three-dimensional model of the dog uterus that responds to reproductive hormones and maintains its normal structure. In addition, we used diseased canine tissue to replicate cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), a condition that affects pregnancy and can lead to the serious disease of pyometra in which the uterus is infected and filled with pus. In future studies, this validated model can be used to study how CEH develops and to test new treatments for the disease.

[PMID: 41186745] The Mongolian Gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) diverged from rats/mice around 45 million years ago and developed adaptations to extreme temperatures and water scarcity. Another feature of the Mongolian Gerbils is their social monogamy similar to that of prairie voles. These observations suggest that there are potential differences in the Mongolian Gerbil brain that are distinct from that of rats and mice. The goal of the present study is to establish the extent to which the neuromeric organization of the brain is conserved in the Mongolian Gerbil and to gain insights on how evolutionary expansion and diversification of brain regions occur across species. Our data shows that the multineuromeric origin of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive processes in the Mongolian Gerbil is similar to that in mice and rats, spanning from the diencephalon, midbrain, and the rostral hindbrain. There are also observable anatomical differences. However, most of the components characteristic of these neuromeres are identifiable in the Mongolian gerbil, closely mirroring those found in mice and rats. Together, these findings suggest that the conserved neuromeric organization likely stems from a restricted genetic toolset that began in the Muridae family 45 million years ago, and that a profound reorganization of the fundamental structural plan delineating the neuromeric segmentation is not required for the emergence of diverse functionality among species of phylogenetically related families. Future studies are needed to establish how the genetic programs within each neuromeric unit are influenced by environmental factors that ultimately impact the size of the neuromeric derivatives and their functional connectivity.

[PMID: 41187091] SUMOylation - a protein post-translational modification (PTM) related to ubiquitylation - involves the reversible covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to proteins. During the conjugation and deconjugation cycle, SUMO is recognised and positioned by various enzymes through specific non-covalent interactions. This review discusses the core interactions with the SAE2 subunit of the SUMOspecific heterodimeric E1 enzyme SAE1:SAE2, the SUMO E2 enzyme UBC9 and the SUMO-specific proteases of the SENP family and USPL1. We describe the evolutionary origins of these interactions and their structural basis; moreover, as SUMO:enzyme interactions are generally similar in their overall outline to those between ubiquitin and its specific enzymes, we highlight these similarities, as well as the differences. All of the mentioned interactions use a similar surface on SUMO, which is distinct from the groove that binds SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), meaning that while the enzyme interactions are mutually exclusive, each is compatible with simultaneous SIM binding. This review is accompanied by another in the same issue that focuses on interactions with SUMO E3 ligases and downstream effectors of SUMOylation, together providing comprehensive coverage of the non-covalent interactions formed by SUMO proteins.",3

Aggravated inflammation is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation.,NLRP3 inflammasome AND Inflammation AND Aggravated AND Activation,"40977728,41008252,40751797","[PMID: 40977728] Chronic endometritis (CE) is a persistent inflammatory disorder of the endometrium, associated with infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and implantation failure. Diagnosis primarily depends on hysteroscopy and immunohistochemistry, while microbial dysbiosis and antibiotic resistance pose significant challenges to effective management. The pathogenesis of CE involves microbial infections that induce immune dysregulation through TLR/NLR signaling pathways, metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, miRNA-mediated inflammatory responses, and DNA methylation alterations. The activation of pro-inflammatory mediators and the NLRP3 inflammasome further aggravates endometrial dysfunction. Treatment typically includes oral antibiotics and intrauterine therapies, although their efficacy is variable. Probiotics have demonstrated potential in restoring microbial balance. This review outlines the inflammatory mechanisms underlying CE and recent therapeutic advancements, highlighting potential targets for improving treatment outcomes.

[PMID: 41008252] Secondary liver injury (SLI) is the most common complication in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and it is susceptible to environmental factors, including diet patterns. As a food-brightening agent, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs) are inevitably consumed by IBD patients. Currently, there are a few studies on TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs exposure to SLI in colitis mice. In this study, a SLI model was built using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) free-drinking for 7 days after pre-exposure to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. The changes in the pathological results and liver function indicators suggested that high-dose TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs only exhibited a slight injury in the liver. With further analysis, we found that pre-exposure to high-dose TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs in mice with SLI led to an increase in intestinal permeability and hepatic LPS content, along with increased inflammatory cytokines and an anti-oxidative system imbalance. Subsequently, accumulated LPS and ROS overproduction activated the NOD-like receptor family pyrin-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, inducing hepatic cell pyroptosis. To provide compelling evidence, NLRP3 gene-deficient mice were used, and the results showed that the absence of NLRP3 improved liver function, alleviated hepatic inflammation, and reduced hepatic oxidative injury in SLI mice with TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs exposure. In summary, these results confirmed the critical role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the TiO<sub>2</sub> NP-aggravated progression of SLI. Our study provided a comprehensive evaluation of foodborne nanoparticles on IBD complications, hoping that more studies can focus on IBD complications affected by environmental factors.

[PMID: 40751797] Neuronal cell death is considered the symbol of early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but the mechanism was still unclear. DDX3X, a member of the DEAD-box helicase family, has a major effect on immune inflammation by mediating RNA metabolism. Recent studies report that DDX3X regulates the balance of NLRP3 inflammasome and stress granules in stress conditions, but the role of DDX3X in SAH is still unknown. Therefore, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the role and mechanism of DDX3X in SAH. Western blot and immunofluorescence showed that SAH promoted DDX3X expression, especially in the cortical neurons. After upregulation of DDX3X, the NLRP3 inflammasome was activated and autophagy was inhibited, resulting in neurological dysfunction and damage to the blood-brain barrier. Further rescue experiments confirmed that DDX3X aggravated neuronal pyroptosis and inhibited autophagy via the NLRP3 inflammasome after SAH. Hence, DDX3X might be a potential therapeutic target for early brain injury of SAH.",3
Amitriptyline is an effective treatment for chronic tension-type headaches.,Amitriptyline AND Chronic AND Tension-Type Headaches AND Efficacy,"25931277,23943730,25499091","[PMID: 25931277] This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in 2005 on selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for preventing migraine and tension-type headache. The original review has been split in two parts and this review now only regards tension-type headache prevention. Another updated review covers migraine. Tension-type headache is the second most common disorder worldwide and has high social and economic relevance. As serotonin and other neurotransmitters may have a role in pain mechanisms, SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been evaluated for the prevention of tension-type headache. To determine the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs and SNRIs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the prevention of episodic and chronic tension-type headache in adults. For the original review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2003, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1994 to May 2003), and Headache Quarterly (1990 to 2003). For this update, we revised the original search strategy to reflect the broader type of intervention (SSRIs and SNRIs). We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10) on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to November 2014), EMBASE (1980 to November 2014), and PsycINFO (1987 to November 2014). We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles and searched trial registries for ongoing trials. We included randomised controlled trials comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with any type of control intervention in participants 18 years and older, of either sex, with tension-type headache. Two authors independently extracted data (headache frequency, index, intensity, and duration; use of symptomatic/analgesic medication; quality of life; and withdrawals) and assessed the risk of bias of trials. The primary outcome is tension-type headache frequency, measured by the number of headache attacks or the number of days with headache per evaluation period. The original review included six studies on tension-type headache. We now include eight studies with a total of 412 participants with chronic forms of tension-type headache. These studies evaluated five SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine) and one SNRI (venlafaxine). The two new studies included in this update are placebo controlled trials, one evaluated sertraline and one venlafaxine. Six studies, already included in the previous version of this review, compared SSRIs to other antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, sulpiride, mianserin). Most of the included studies had methodological and/or reporting shortcomings and lacked adequate power. Follow-up ranged between two and four months.Six studies explored the effect of SSRIs or SNRIs on tension-type headache frequency, the primary endpoint. At eight weeks of follow-up, we found no difference when compared to placebo (two studies, N = 127; mean difference (MD) -0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.95 to 2.03; I(2)= 0%) or amitriptyline (two studies, N = 152; MD 0.76, 95% CI -2.05 to 3.57; I(2)= 44%).When considering secondary outcomes, SSRIs reduce the symptomatic/analgesic medication use for acute headache attacks compared to placebo (two studies, N = 118; MD -1.87, 95% CI -2.09 to -1.65; I(2)= 0%). However, amitriptyline appeared to reduce the intake of analgesic more efficiently than SSRIs (MD 4.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 8.84; I(2)= 0%). The studies supporting these findings were considered at unclear risk of bias. We found no differences compared to placebo or other antidepressants in headache duration and intensity.SSRIs or SNRI were generally more tolerable than tricyclics. However, the two groups did not differ in terms of number of participants who withdrew due to adverse events or for other reasons (four studies, N = 257; odds ratio (OR) 1.04; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.60; I(2)= 25% and OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.38; I(2)= 0%).We did not find any study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with pharmacological treatments other than antidepressants (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non-drug therapies (e.g. psycho-behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture). Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or venlafaxine (a SNRI) as preventive drugs for tension-type headache. Over two months of treatment, SSRIs or venlafaxine are no more effective than placebo or amitriptyline in reducing headache frequency in patients with chronic tension-type headache. SSRIs seem to be less effective than tricyclic antidepressants in terms of intake of analgesic medications. Tricyclic antidepressants are associated with more adverse events; however, this did not cause a greater number of withdrawals. No reliable information is available at longer follow-up. Our conclusion is that the use of SSRIs and venlafaxine for the prevention of chronic tension-type headache is not supported by evidence.

[PMID: 23943730] Patients often present with chronic facial pain despite normal nasal endoscopy and sinus computerized tomography. Such pain has increasingly been recognized as being of neurological origin with one of the commonest underlying causes being mid-facial segmental tension-type pain (MFP) which is a version of tension headache in the face. Descending serotonergic neuronal projections are known to modulate pain and intra-platelet serotonin levels are an accepted model reflecting central intra-neuronal serotonin. 1.To determine whether low-dose amitriptyline significantly changes whole blood serotonin compared to a surrogate placebo in patients with chronic MFP 2. To determine whether the addition of pindolol, a beta blocker with serotonin receptor blocking properties further alters blood serotonin. Sixty-two patients were randomized to three treatment groups a) amitriptyline , b) amitriptyline with pindolol, and c) loratadine as surrogate placebo. Whole blood serotonin was taken before and after 8 weeks of treatment. Serotonin was also measured in 40 age-matched healthy controls. There was a significant reduction in blood serotonin levels in the amitriptyline with pindolol group. A non-significant reduction was seen in the amitriptyline group, with no change in serotonin levels in the surrogate placebo group. A comparison of change in serotonin with change in pain frequency and intensity scores is presented. Women in the control group had significantly higher serotonin levels than men. Women with tension-type facial pain who failed to respond to treatment had significantly lower blood serotonin than women in the control group. When linked to the clinical response this study provides evidence that the serotonergic system is involved in the modulation of chronic MFP. Serotonin levels are sex-dependent and related to treatment response.

[PMID: 25499091] Post-traumatic headache is one of the most common symptoms occurring after mild traumatic brain injury in children. This is an expert opinion-based two-part review on pediatric post-traumatic headaches. In part II, we focus on the medical management of post-traumatic headaches. There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of therapies specifically for pediatric post-traumatic headaches. Thus, the algorithm we propose has been extrapolated from the primary headache literature and small noncontrolled trials of post-traumatic headache. Most post-traumatic headaches are migraine or tension type, and standard medications for these headache types are used. A multifaceted approach is needed to address all the possible causes of headache and any comorbid conditions that may delay recovery or alter treatment choices. For acute treatment, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories can be used. If the headaches have migrainous features and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are not effective, triptans may be beneficial. Opioids are not indicated. Medication overuse should be avoided. For preventive treatments, some reports indicate that amitriptyline, gabapentin, or topiramate may be beneficial. Amitriptyline is a good choice because it can be used to treat both migraine and tension-type headaches. Nerve blocks, nutraceuticals (e.g. melatonin), and behavioral therapies may also be useful, and lifestyle factors, especially adequate sleep hygiene and strategies to cope with anxiety, should be emphasized. Improved treatment of acute post-traumatic headache may reduce the likelihood of developing chronic headaches, which can be especially problematic to effectively manage and can be functionally debilitating.",3
An M2-like phenotype in brown adipose tissue macrophages is quickly induced by cold exposure.,M2-like macrophage AND brown adipose tissue AND cold exposure AND induction,41186624,"[PMID: 41186624] Breast cancer is the leading cancer type that is reported in women worldwide, with its 2.3 million annual incidence and 685,000-related deaths (WHO, 2023). Although genetic mutations have proven to be major driving agents of tumorigenesis, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly being considered as the definitive indicator of disease progression, metastasis, immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. It is an active, diverse cellular webwork of substances cancer-related fibroblasts, (CAFs), tumor-related macrophages, (TAMs), regulatory T cells, (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cancer-related adipocytes; (CAAs). These cellular processes interact reciprocally with not only malignant cells through paracrine communication but also through the composition of the extracellular matrix, (ECM). Recent research indicates that CAFs produce pro-invasive factors i.e. TGF-B and HGF whereas TAMs tend to be M2-like and secret VEGF and IL-10 to encourage angiogenesis and immune subversion. Cytokines, chemokines, ECM proteins, and tumor-derived EVs are non-cellular factors serving to alter cellular phenotypes and facilitate construction of metastatic niche. Besides oncogenic microRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-10b) that is released in exosome, hypoxia-mediated activation of HIF-1a induces both neovascularization and metabolic reprogramming. The repolarization of TAM (e.g. CSF1R inhibitors) and depletion of CAF and inhibition of EV pathway are also being explored as therapeutic mechanisms against TME resistance and are in preclinical and clinical development. In particular, the combination procedures with immunomodulation and TME disruption have demonstrated some success in conquering resistance in TNBC models. Therefore, it is paramount to understand how the surrounding tissue, the immune system, the immune system, and other elements behave over time and space as cofounding partners of tumors, in a way that would create better precision and clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients.",1
Anthrax spores remain deadly until affected areas are decontaminated.,anthrax spores AND deadly AND decontamination AND persistence,"41187153,41187132,41187131","[PMID: 41187153] Wild mushroom poisoning represents a significant public health challenge in China, with the highest mortality rate globally. Despite extensive prevention campaigns, consumption behaviors persist, particularly among university students who may be influenced by social media and peer pressure. This study applied Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to investigate psychological factors influencing wild mushroom consumption intentions among Chinese university students and identify key predictors for targeted intervention development. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 216 Chinese university students. The PMT model included threat appraisal (perceived severity, susceptibility, benefits, costs) and coping appraisal (response efficacy, self-efficacy, response costs). Behavioral intention was assessed through scenario-based consumption likelihood measures. Structural equation modeling was used to test the theoretical model. The PMT model demonstrated good fit (χ²/df = 2.14, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.073, SRMR = 0.065) and explained 42.3% of the variance in wild mushroom consumption intentions (R² = 0.423, 95% CI [0.35, 0.49]). Perceived benefits emerged as the strongest positive predictor (β = 0.385, 95% CI [0.27, 0.50], p < 0.001), while self-efficacy was the strongest negative predictor (β = -0.298, 95% CI [-0.42, -0.18], p < 0.001). Traditional threat appraisal components (severity and susceptibility) showed minimal predictive effects. Response costs also significantly predicted consumption intentions (β = 0.156, 95% CI [0.04, 0.27], p < 0.01). PMT provides a valuable framework for understanding wild mushroom consumption behavior among Chinese university students. The dominance of perceived benefits and self-efficacy as predictors suggests that effective interventions should address positive outcome expectations while building confidence in avoidance behaviors. These findings indicate that effective interventions must move beyond traditional risk communication to address the complex interplay of perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and social factors driving consumption decisions, with implications for developing culturally-tailored, multi-component prevention strategies.

[PMID: 41187132] The global rise in overweight and obesity poses significant public health challenges, contributing to premature mortality and preventable disabilities. Moreover, efforts to increase reproductive autonomy through the promotion of modern contraceptive methods are underway, with persisting concerns regarding their potential influence on weight gain. This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with overweight and obesity and to examine the mediating role of hormonal contraceptive usage among Ghanaian women of reproductive age. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using secondary data from the 2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, which involved 6,181 women aged 20 years and above. The data was cleaned and analysed with Stata Corp version 18. Associations between overweight/obesity and various sociodemographic factors were assessed, and survey-adjusted logistic regression model was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios. Survey-adjusted mediation analysis was performed via structural equation modelling to evaluate the indirect effects of hormonal contraceptives use on the relationships between the independent variables and BMI. The analysis revealed that factors such as age, highest educational attainment, marital status, religion, residential status, region, nature of employment, and wealth quintile were significantly associated with high BMI with the exception of contraceptive usage. The results of the mediation showed that, hormonal contraceptives had no significant indirect role on the relationship between high BMI and its covariates. The study revealed several determinants of high BMI, however, hormonal contraceptives neither directly nor indirectly influenced high BMI. Whereas, there is the need to integrate weight management counselling into family planning for general well-being, there is the need to intensify education to dispel misconception about the weight gain associated with the usage of hormonal contraceptives to maximize the uptake of contraceptives and improve the overall health of women in Ghana.

[PMID: 41187131] To identify predictors of extension of the injection interval beyond 8 weeks at the 24-month visit after switching to brolucizumab in aflibercept-resistant polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Retrospective observational study. 17 eyes of 16 patients with persistent or recurrent exudation on aflibercept were switched to intravitreal brolucizumab and managed with a treat-and-extend (T&E) regimen with a minimum 8-week interval after loading. The primary outcome contrasted extension (>8 weeks) versus non-extension (≤8 weeks) at month 24. Prespecified predictors were early central choroidal thickness (CCT) change from baseline to the switch visit (A0 to A1; ≥ 40% reduction) and pachychoroid. Associations were tested with Fisher's exact tests and Firth-penalized logistic regression with the event defined as extension. At 24 months, 6 of 17 eyes (35%) achieved extension. A ≥ 40% early CCT reduction occurred in 0 of 6 extension eyes versus 7 of 11 non-extension eyes (Fisher exact two-sided P ≈ 0.035). In the Firth model (event = extension), < 40% CCT reduction strongly predicted extension (odds ratio 38.5; profile-likelihood 95% CI 2.0-10,000; LR P = 0.004). Non-pachychoroid showed the same direction with wide CIs (odds ratio 14.3; 95% CI 0.99-2,174; LR P = 0.006). Model fit was significant (LR χ² = 15.19, P = 0.0005) and discrimination was good (apparent AUC ≈ 0.97). We prespecified a parsimonious two-predictor model to limit overfitting; adding age, sex, prior photodynamic therapy, or number of prior aflibercept injections did not materially change coefficients or improve AICc (ΔAICc < 2). Eyes without marked early choroidal thinning (<40% CCT reduction at A1) were more likely to extend, whereas marked thinning (≥40%) signaled difficulty extending under T&E regimen after switching to brolucizumab. Given the small sample and few events, estimates should be interpreted cautiously and considered hypothesis-generating, and warrant prospective external validation studies.",3

We aimed to conduct a study to compare the efficacy of cinnarizine and amitriptyline in pediatric migraine prophylaxis. In a randomized, double-blind trial, patients aged 4-17 years with migraine who were eligible for prophylaxis enrolled. The primary outcome was a reduction response rate of ≥50% with <i>p</i> < 0.005 with respect to headache characteristics. The secondary outcome was migraine disability assessment. We evaluated patients every four weeks for three months: T1: week 4, T2: week 8 and T3: week 12. The safety profile was also assessed. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to each group. However, 43 patients completed the trial. Headache frequency decreased in amitriptyline group more effectively in T1 (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Amitriptyline was more successful in reducing the headache duration in all three periods (<i>p</i> < 0.005). There was no significant difference in severity improvement and reducing disability score between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.005). No serious adverse events were observed. Both medications are effective in ameliorating migraine headaches and related disabilities. However, amitriptyline appears be a preferable option over cinnarizine, given its faster onset of action, efficacy in reducing headache duration and longer-lasting effects.<b>Trial Registration:</b> The study was registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) under the code IRCT-20191112045413N1.

[PMID: 39327755] To evaluate the effectiveness of nortriptyline regimen and migraine dietary/lifestyle modifications on dizziness and stress levels in patients diagnosed with vestibular migraine (VM). A total of 35 patients diagnosed with definite VM based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders were included in this intervention study. Patients self-selected to receive either nortriptyline regimen alone (10-40 mg daily with biweekly escalation) (group A, n = 17) or migraine dietary/lifestyle modifications alone (group B, n = 18). Main outcome measures were dizziness severity and stress level measured by the visual analog scale (VAS). At 4-week post-treatment, dizziness decreased from 6.0 ± 2.5 to 4.2 ± 3.4 (p = 0.069) in group A and from 8.7 ± 1.5 to 3.6 ± 3.0 (p < 0.001) in group B. VAS for stress changed from 5.5 ± 1.3 to 5.4 ± 2.9 (p = 0.93) and from 6.9 ± 3.2 to 5.0 ± 2.7 (p = 0.025) in groups A and B, respectively. The δ values of the VAS score for dizziness were 1.8 ± 3.7 and 5.1 ± 3.1 and the δ values of the VAS score for stress were 0.06 ± 2.9 and 1.9 ± 3.3 in groups A and B, respectively. Quality of life (QOL) improved in 88% patients in group A and 94% patients in group B. Nortriptyline, at a maximum dose of 40 mg, effectively alleviates patient symptoms, while a migraine diet and lifestyle modifications notably reduce vertiginous symptoms and stress levels in VM patients in 4 weeks. Both interventions are equally effective in ameliorating the QOL of patients. The ideal treatment for patients would likely need to include both medication and diet/lifestyle changes.

[PMID: 40252602] Migraine is a common neurological disorder in children, significantly impacting quality of life and academic performance. The kynurenine pathway, a major metabolic route of tryptophan, plays a critical role in neuroinflammation and neurotransmission, yet its involvement in pediatric migraine remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate alterations in kynurenine pathway metabolites in children with migraine and assess their correlation with headache frequency and severity. A case-control study was conducted including pediatric patients diagnosed with migraine (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 48). Serum levels of tryptophan (TRP) and its kynurenine pathway metabolites-including kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA)-were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS) scores were used to evaluate the functional impact of migraine. Statistical analyses included comparisons between groups and correlation assessments between metabolite levels and clinical parameters. KYN, KYNA, and the KYN/TRP ratio were significantly higher in the migraine group compared to controls (p < 0.05). KYNA/3-HK ratios showed a negative correlation with headache frequency and PedMIDAS scores, whereas 3-HK levels were positively correlated with PedMIDAS scores. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified KYN as a potential biomarker for distinguishing migraine patients from controls, with a sensitivity of 86.7 % and specificity of 45.8 % at a cutoff value of 1415. This study is the first to evaluate kynurenine pathway metabolites in pediatric migraine. The findings suggest that alterations in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, particularly increased KYN and KYNA levels, may serve as compensatory mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology. Future studies should explore the therapeutic implications of targeting the kynurenine pathway in pediatric migraine treatment.",3
Antimicrobial agents are less effective due to the pressure of antimicrobial usage.,antimicrobial resistance AND overuse of antibiotics AND pressure of antimicrobial use AND reduced efficacy of antimicrobials,"40084881,33156838,24646082","[PMID: 40084881] Antibiotic resistance, driven by misuse and overuse of antibiotics, is one of the greatest threats against human health. The antimicrobial pressure during prolonged antibiotic treatment of chronic bacterial infections selects for resistance. While antibiotic combinations may reduce resistance emergence, antibiotic-tolerant persister cells can serve as a reservoir for resistance development. Therefore, targeting these cells with anti-persister drugs might provide a novel strategy for resistance prevention. In this study, we conducted 42 days of adaptive laboratory evolution using <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> exposed to rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, daptomycin, and vancomycin, alone or in combination with the anti-persister drug mitomycin C. We monitored antibiotic susceptibility daily and assessed phenotypic changes in growth and biofilm formation in evolved strains. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations linked to antibiotic resistance and phenotypic shifts. Rifampicin resistance developed within a few days, while ciprofloxacin and daptomycin emerged in approximately 3 weeks. Treatments with vancomycin or mitomycin C resulted in minimal changes in susceptibility. While combination therapy delayed resistance, it did not fully prevent it. Notably, the combination of rifampicin with mitomycin C maintained rifampicin susceptibility throughout the long-term evolution experiment. Sub-inhibitory antibiotic treatments selected for both previously characterized and novel mutations, including unprecedented alterations in the nucleotide excision repair system and azoreductase following mitomycin C exposure. The delayed resistance development observed with combination therapy, particularly mitomycin C's ability to suppress rifampicin resistance, suggests potential therapeutic applications. Future studies should evaluate the clinical efficacy of anti-persister drugs in preventing resistance across different bacterial pathogens and infection models.

[PMID: 33156838] Development of drug resistance in opportunistic pathogens is one of the major healthcare challenges associated with infection management. Combination therapy has many advantages due to the simultaneous action of two drugs on two separate cellular targets. However, selection of the drugs should offer safety and synergistic interaction against most of the strains. Here, the efficacy of antibiotics in combination with quercetin, a natural flavonoid capable of targeting quorum sensing was tested against biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains previously isolated from catheter associated urinary tract infection. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility pattern, synergistic effect of quercetin with selected antibiotics (levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, gentamycin, tobramycin and amikacin) was tested at the fractional concentrations of MIC by the checkerboard method and the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICi) was calculated to estimate the synergistic effect. Effect of the synergistic combinations were further tested using time-kill assay, and against biofilm formation and biofilm cell viability. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using Human Embryonic Kidney 293T cells (HEK-293T) using the effective drug combinations with respective controls. The biofilm formation and biofilm cell viability were drastically affected with quercetin and selected antibiotics combinations with ≥80% inhibition. In vitro infection studies showed that all the strains could exert significant cell killing (68 to 85%) and the drug combinations decreased the infection rate significantly by reducing the cell killing effect of P. aeruginosa (p<0.05). The synergistic effect of quercetin is attributed to its quorum sensing inhibitory properties. These findings indicate that quercetin along with existing antibiotics can potentiate the treatment against P. aeruginosa infection and may reduce the selection pressure due to antibiotic overuse.

[PMID: 24646082] Antibiotics are the medical wonder of our age, but an increasing frequency of resistance among key pathogens is rendering them less effective. If this trend continues the consequences for cancer patients, organ transplant patients, and indeed the general community could be disastrous. The problem is complex, involving abuse and overuse of antibiotics (selecting for an increasing frequency of resistant bacteria), together with a lack of investment in discovery and development (resulting in an almost dry drug development pipeline). Remedial approaches to the problem should include taking measures to reduce the selective pressures for resistance development, and taking measures to incentivize renewed investment in antibiotic discovery and development. Bringing new antibiotics to the clinic is critical because this is currently the only realistic therapy that can ensure the level of infection control required for many medical procedures. Here we outline the complex process involved in taking a potential novel antibiotic from the initial discovery of a hit molecule, through lead and candidate drug development, up to its entry into phase I clinical trials. The stringent criteria that a successful drug must meet, balancing high efficacy in vivo against a broad spectrum of pathogens, with minimal liabilities against human targets, explain why even with sufficient investment this process is prone to a high failure rate. This emphasizes the need to create a well-funded antibiotic discovery and development pipeline that can sustain the continuous delivery of novel candidate drugs into clinical trials, to ensure the maintenance of the advanced medical procedures we currently take for granted.",3
Autologous transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells has better graft function than induction therapy with anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibodies.,autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplantation AND graft function AND induction therapy AND anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibodies,"41186829,41186643,41186530","[PMID: 41186829] Given the high risk of relapse for Philadelphia-negative (Ph-negative) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is often recommended following first complete remission (CR1) in high-risk patients. However, in the era of measurable residual disease (MRD) testing, allo-HCT may not be indicated for patients with standard-risk disease. Here we review the use of allo-HCT and other consolidative approaches for standard- and high-risk Ph-negative ALL, based on MRD following induction therapy. Allo-HCT is strongly indicated for patients with high-risk Ph-negative ALL, especially those who are MRD positive at end of induction. Ongoing trials using cellular and immune therapies such as blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have shown promising results in deepening response and decreasing relapse. Further, these agents have demonstrated overall manageable safety profiles. The role for allo-HCT following CR1 in patients with standard risk Ph-negative ALL is evolving with advances in therapeutic approaches. MRD is emerging as a critical prognostic factor regardless of treatment strategy, thus questioning the necessity of transplant in MRD-negative patients. With the advances in safety and accessibility of allo-HCT as well as novel therapeutics, overall outcomes in ALL continue to improve.

[PMID: 41186643] Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) lacks consistent biomarkers to monitor treatment response and predict survival. Metabolically active extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying tumor-specific KRAS mutations offer promise as disease-specific biomarkers. Informed by genomic profiling of tumor tissue, plasma samples were prospectively collected from 44 patients, with confirmed KRAS-mutated PDAC, undergoing neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) followed by surgery between 2019 and 2021. Samples were obtained at diagnosis, post-NAT, and 1 month post surgery. EVs were isolated using lipid nanoprobe technology, and EV-associated KRAS mutations were detected using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Patients were grouped on the basis of temporal changes in EV-associated KRAS mutation allele frequency (MAF): no KRAS detected (ND), decreasing MAF (DD), and increasing MAF (ID). Among 44 patients, 29 (65.9%) were ND, 8 (18.2%) DD, and 7 (15.9%) ID. Detectable EV-associated KRAS MAF was found in 21%, 30%, and 50% of patients with stages I, II, and III PDAC. No significant differences were noted in demographic or clinical variables (p > 0.05). The ND group had the longest restricted mean disease-free survival (rmDFS: 31.2 months), followed by DD (27.8 months) and ID (9.8 months; p = 0.010). Similarly, restricted mean overall survival (rmOS) was longest in the ND (40.3 months), followed by DD (35.7 months) and ID (17.7 months; p = 0.012). On multivariable analysis, increasing EV-KRAS MAF (ID group) independently predicted inferior rmDFS [hazard ratio (HR): 6.14; p = 0.001] and rmOS (HR: 6.95; p = 0.002). Temporal increase of EV-KRAS MAF is a significant predictor of reduced DFS and OS in PDAC. Integrating EV-KRAS mutation allele frequency dynamics analysis with current biomarkers such as carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) could improve treatment monitoring and survival prognostication.

[PMID: 41186530] Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the management of hepatocellular carcinoma. Landmark trials, including IMbrave150 and HIMALAYA, have established combination ICI therapies as the standard of care for advanced HCC. Beyond these indications, ICIs are now being explored as neoadjuvant therapies for liver transplantation, offering potential benefits in downstaging tumors and serving as bridging therapies for patients outside traditional transplant eligibility criteria. While early evidence from case reports and trials highlights promising oncologic and survival outcomes, the current understanding of ICI use before LT introduces new, unexplored challenges. Allograft rejection, safety concerns regarding immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and the effective management of the complex interplay between immunosuppression and immune therapy represent ongoing themes of discussion. The tumor microenvironment and immunomolecular profiles, which critically influence ICI efficacy, remain the true cornerstones of patient stratification yet to be fully understood. Additionally, the lack of reliable biomarkers and the limitations of current radiologic criteria complicate treatment planning and response evaluation. Overcoming these obstacles requires multidisciplinary collaboration, refined patient selection strategies, and robust clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of ICIs in this context. This review aims to provide an up-to-date summary of the ever-evolving role of ICIs in LT strategies, offering a comprehensive overview of proposed therapeutic protocols, their oncologic and safety profiles, and the integration of emerging biological insights into clinical practice.",3
B cells go though plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2.,B cells AND plasmablast differentiation AND antibody production AND EBI2 expression,"41186818,41186316,41184864","[PMID: 41186818] T cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major obstacle to effective immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The molecular mechanisms underlying T cell exclusion remain poorly understood. This study identifies RANBP1 as an oncogenic factor in TNBC and investigates its role in modulating T cell infiltration and tumor progression. Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing were used to assess immune cell infiltration associated with RANBP1 expression. RANBP1 protein levels were evaluated in 87 TNBC tumor and adjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess overall survival. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to explore the RANBP1/miR-769-5p/PRUNE2 pathway. scRNA-seq identified 10 cell types in the TNBC TME. High RANBP1 expression correlated with increased tumor cells, B cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells, and reduced T cells. Cell-cell communication was enhanced in the high-RANBP1 group. TCGA and GSE65194 data confirmed decreased CD4⁺ T cells and Tregs in high-RANBP1 tumors. RANBP1 was significantly upregulated in TNBC and associated with poor prognosis. Functional studies showed that RANBP1 promotes TNBC cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, RANBP1 upregulates oncogenic miR-769-5p, which suppresses PRUNE2, a tumor suppressor that normally inhibits TNBC progression. RANBP1 shapes an immunosuppressive microenvironment in TNBC by reducing T cell infiltration through the miR-769-5p/PRUNE2 axis. These findings reveal a novel immune escape mechanism and suggest that targeting RANBP1 may enhance immunotherapy efficacy in TNBC.

[PMID: 41186316] Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a common symptom and may be an early sign of systemic sclerosis (SSc). To identify biomarkers distinguishing whether RP is associated with definitive SSc, we used phosphospecific flow cytometry to measure phosphorylated (p) signalling molecules [signal transducers and activators of transcription (pSTAT3, pSTAT6, pSTAT4), pSmad2/3, nuclear factor-κB (pNF-κB)] in peripheral blood leucocytes of RP patients undergoing nailfold videocapillaroscopy. Leucocyte subsets (CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells) were identified by surface markers, and phosphorylation was measured after cytokine or lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Medical records were reviewed 9-10 years later, comparing RP subjects who developed SSc (SSc<sup>+</sup>, n = 8) with those who did not (SSc<sup>-</sup>, n = 17) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 8). SSc<sup>+</sup> patients had significantly higher constitutive pSmad2/3 levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than SSc<sup>-</sup> or HCs (p = 0.005 and p = 0.034). SSc<sup>+</sup> and SSc<sup>-</sup> had higher stimulated pSTAT3(pY705) levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than HCs (p = 0.001 and p = 0.026). SSc<sup>+</sup> had higher stimulated pSTAT6 levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with HCs (p = 0.017) and in CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells compared with SSc<sup>-</sup> and HCs (p = 0.006 and p < 0.001). SSc<sup>+</sup> had higher stimulated pSTAT4 levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with SSc<sup>-</sup> and HCs (p = 0.004 and p = 0.037) and in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with SSc<sup>-</sup> (p = 0.007). No significant differences were found in pNF-κB and pSTAT3(pS727) levels. The results give insights into the pathogenesis of SSc. Smad2/3, STAT3(pY705), STAT6, and STAT4 pathways may serve as novel SSc biomarkers.

[PMID: 41184864] Chemokines and their receptors play a pivotal role in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) and modulating immune responses by orchestrating immune cell recruitment, spatial positioning, and facilitating cell-cell interactions. However, the exact mechanisms underlying chemokine signaling across different cell populations within the TME remain poorly understood. In this study, we utilized multiple-omics approaches to explore the relationship between CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, CD8<sup>+</sup> exhausted T (Tex) cells, and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy response, as well as the role of chemokine signaling in the formation of CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophage and CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cell niches. We found that CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages were closely associated with ICB outcomes in melanoma. Additionally, combination therapy with a CCR1 antagonist and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced tumor burden in melanoma mouse models, which was attributed to the substantial depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cells. Further, CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages were found to co-localize with CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cells in human melanoma tissue, and the CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophage-CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cell niche was correlated with ICB treatment response in mice. Importantly, the CCR1-CCL3 axis was identified as a critical mediator in the formation of this niche. Overall, our study underscores the spatial relationship between CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cells in ICB therapy, providing a promising strategy to overcome ICB resistance in melanoma.",3

The structures of the compounds were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis using HRESIMS, 1D/2D NMR, and comparison with reported data. All isolated glycosides were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against HeLa and HepG2 cell lines. Among these, cynapanoside K (4) exhibited antiproliferative effects on HeLa cells by inducing apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle arrest. Mechanistic studies revealed that 4 downregulated Bcl-2, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 protein expression while activating Caspase-9, suggesting mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways contribute to its cytotoxic activity. This study expands the chemical diversity of bioactive C<sub>21</sub> steroidal glycosides and provides insights into their potential antitumor mechanisms.

[PMID: 40614544] Among female cancers, breast cancer is the most prevalent type with a high tendency for metastasis, which makes it compelling to develop new therapeutic modalities in the battle against this disease. For this purpose, a new series of theophylline-based derivatives was designed as dual STAT3/NF-B signaling pathway inhibitors. The most active three compounds (12a, 12b and 17b) exhibited potent inhibition of both STAT3 and NF-κB activation in 4 T1 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.22-8.21 μM. They also exerted considerable anticancer activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.53 to 7.68 μM in 4 T1, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. These compounds demonstrated their ability to inhibit breast cancer cell migration, and invasion in scratch and transwell assays, respectively. As a consequence of STAT3 inhibition, compound 12a was able to induce apoptosis via its effects on key apoptotic regulators; caspases-3,9, Bax and Bcl-2. Besides, western blotting of 12a-treated MDA-MB-231 cells confirmed decreased expression of STAT3, p-STAT3, Bcl-xl, c-Myc and NF-κB. Moreover, compound 12a reduced tumor volume in a comparable manner to 5FU in an Ehrlich solid carcinoma model. Docking of these compounds into the active sites of STAT3 and NF-κB revealed adequate binding patterns, providing further support for their effectiveness. Hence, these compounds proved to possess structural determinants that could be further tuned into more potent anticancer agents for breast cancer.

[PMID: 41028090] Natural plant active compounds can be applied to treat infected wounds due to their antibacterial and antioxidant properties. However, because of their degradable nature, these compounds must be coated in polymeric structures, such as chitosan (CS). Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are incorporated into CS to enhance its mechanical properties. This study investigated the effects of hydrogels prepared from CS/SWCNTs and linalool (CS/SWCNTs/Lin) on the treatment of infected wounds in a mouse model. The physicochemical properties of the prepared structures were examined, along with in vitro release, cytotoxicity, and antibacterial properties. Wound contraction, total bacterial count, histopathological parameters, and the expressions of BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2), Beclin-1, Caspase-3, c-Myc, Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), P53, superoxide dismutase (SOD), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and collagen type I (COL-1A), as well as serum concentrations of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were investigated. The physicochemical properties confirmed the successful synthesis of the structures, and CS/SWCNTs reduced the rapid release of linalool within the first 24 h. The results also confirmed the safety and antibacterial properties of the structures. The administration of hydrogels significantly reduced the total bacterial count and edema, accelerated the wound healing process, and increased the expression of Beclin-1, BCL-2, Caspase-3, c-Myc, GPx, SOD, P53, TGF-β, and collagen 1A, as well as the serum concentration of TAC compared to control groups. In summary, CS/SWCNTs/Lin hydrogels accelerated the wound healing process by influencing the expression of apoptotic molecules and antioxidant factors in an infected wound model in mice.",3
BRCA 1 mutation carriers' risk of breast and ovarian cancer depends on where the mutation is located.,BRCA1 mutation AND mutation location AND breast cancer AND ovarian cancer,"41057936,40419811,38544832","[PMID: 41057936] Inherited mutations in BRCA1 are among the primary causes of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Genetic testing has identified numerous pathogenic and benign mutations in BRCA1, but also thousands of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) with unclear functional consequences. Accurate cancer risk prediction for carriers of these VUS requires functional assays to assess their pathogenicity. In this study, we analyzed 16 BRCA1 VUS detected at the Hereditary Cancer Genetic Counseling Laboratory in Salamanca, Spain, with the goal of providing additional data to guide their reclassification. Since homologous recombination (HR) is the primary tumor-suppressive function of BRCA1, we employed two complementary HR repair assays to evaluate HR efficiency. The first, an already established assay, uses a HeLa-DR cell line harboring an HR reporter cassette and involves silencing endogenous BRCA1 followed by complementation with the VUS under study. The second, developed in this work, is also based in complementation assays that restore the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene, and employs a breast cancer cell line with a similar HR reporter system (HCC1937-HR) that lacks BRCA1 expression, allowing direct complementation. Both assays consistently identified five VUS (p.V11G, p.H888Y, p.G1201S, p.Q1395R, and p.F1734L) as pathogenic due to significantly reduced HR efficiency, whereas the remaining 11 VUS were benign in terms of HR function. Notably, two pathogenic variants (p.H888Y, p.G1201S) were located outside the known functional domains of BRCA1. The five HR-deficient variants were further evaluated for their sensitivity to ionizing radiation, which confirmed the deleterious impact on DNA repair for variants p.V11G, p.H888Y, p.G1201S and p.F1734L. Sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib revealed hypersensitivity only in cells expressing p.V11G and p.F1734L, suggesting variant-specific mechanistic effects with potential therapeutic relevance. In conclusion, recombination-based functional assays complemented with sensitivity assays are effective tools for assessing the pathogenicity of BRCA1 VUS and can provide valuable information to support clinical decision-making. We propose that these assays can be completed within a timeframe compatible with clinical needs, offering critical insights for genetic counseling and personalized treatment strategies.

[PMID: 40419811] Tatars and Bashkirs are large and closely related ethnic communities that reside in the territory of the Russian Federation but have managed to preserve their national identity through the course of history. This study included 446 Tatars, 53 Bashkirs, and 26 women of mixed Tatar-Bashkir ethnicity. Germline DNA analysis was performed for 349 breast cancer (BC) patients with clinical features of hereditary disease (family history, or young onset (</= 50 years), or BC bilaterality, or triple-negative receptor status (lack of expression of ER, PgR, and HER2) and 176 subjects with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). BRCA1 pathogenic variants (PVs) were detected in 63 women; surprisingly, five Slavic founder alleles accounted for 30 (48%) of the BRCA1 PVs. The genuine Tatar BRCA1 allele, c.5161C > T, was observed in 11 subjects. Among 27 women with BRCA2 PVs, six and five women were carriers of the c.-39-1_-39del and c.468dup variants, respectively. The loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) test confirmed the pathogenic nature of the c.-39-1_-39del [rs758732038] allele, which is located in the 5'UTR of BRCA2. Analysis of other BC-associated genes revealed single instances of PVs affecting PALB2, TP53, ATM, RAD51, and RAD51D genes. Tatars and Bashkirs, which are ethnically and religiously separated from Russians, carry an unexpectedly high proportion of Slavic BRCA1/2 founder alleles. The identification of recurrent Tatar/Bashkir BRCA2 pathogenic 5'UTR variant c.-39-1_-39del calls for a systematic analysis of regulatory regions of cancer-predisposing genes in patients with missing heritability.

[PMID: 38544832] <i>BRCA1/2</i> genes are part of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathways in charge of error-free double-strand break (DSB) repair. Loss-of-function mutations of <i>BRCA1/2</i> genes have been associated for a long time with breast and ovarian cancer hereditary syndrome. Recently, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have revolutionized the therapeutic landscape of <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutated tumors, especially of <i>BRCA1/2</i> high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), taking advantage of HR deficiency through the synthetic lethality concept. However, PARPi efficiency differs among patients, and most of them will develop resistance, particularly in the relapse setting. In the current proposal, we aim to review primary and secondary resistance to PARPi in HGSC owing to <i>BRCA1/2</i> alterations. Of note, as several mechanisms of primary or secondary resistance to PARPi have been described, <i>BRCA1/2</i> reversion mutations that restore HR pathways are by far the most reported. First, the type and location of the <i>BRCA1/2</i> primary mutation have been associated with PARPi and platinum-salt sensitivity and impact the probability of the occurrence and the type of secondary reversion mutation. Furthermore, the presence of multiple reversion mutations and the variation of allelic frequency under treatment underline the role of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in treatment resistance. Of note, circulating tumor DNA might help us to detect and characterize reversion mutations and ITH to finally refine the treatment strategy. Importantly, forthcoming therapeutic strategies, including combination with antiangiogenics or with targeted therapies, may help us delay and overcome PARPi resistance secondary to <i>BRCA1/2</i> reversion mutations. Also, progression despite PARPi therapy does not preclude PARPi rechallenge in selected patients.",3

Here, we report the case of an 87-year-old woman treated with low-dose prednisolone and methotrexate for polymyalgia rheumatica, incidentally diagnosed with small miliary nodules in her lungs on chest computed tomography without any symptoms. Moreover, the patient reported being full of energy. The acid-fast bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction test from various sites, including the transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, were negative; however, the histology of the TBLB specimen revealed epithelioid granuloma without acid-fast bacteria. One and a half months later, she was admitted to our hospital with fever and somnolence. The cerebrospinal fluid culture test was positive for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</i> and the patient was diagnosed with miliary TB complicated by tuberculous meningitis. This report suggests that although systemic symptoms usually accompany miliary TB, patients can be asymptomatic, and careful follow-up is important when suspected.

[PMID: 41128098] In 2023, an estimated 1.3 million children (aged 0-14 years) became ill with tuberculosis, and 166,000 children (aged 0-15 years) died from the disease. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) is a molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic test that detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2020 and last updated in 2022. Parts of the current update informed the 2024 WHO updated guidance for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra for detecting pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance in children (aged 0-9 years) with presumed tuberculosis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and three trial registers without language restrictions to 6 October 2023. For study design, we included cross-sectional and cohort studies and randomized trials that evaluated Xpert Ultra in HIV-positive and HIV-negative children aged birth to nine years. Regarding specimen type, we included studies evaluating sputum, gastric, stool, or nasopharyngeal specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis); cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis); and fine needle aspirate or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis). Reference standards for detection of tuberculosis were microbiological reference standard (MRS; including culture) or composite reference standard (CRS); for stool, we considered Xpert Ultra in sputum or gastric aspirates in addition to culture. Reference standards for detection of rifampicin resistance in sputum were phenotypic drug susceptibility testing or targeted or whole genome sequencing. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the tailored QUADAS-2 tool, judging risk of bias separately for each target condition and sample type. We conducted separate meta-analyses for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance. We used a bivariate model to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. This update included 23 studies (including 9 new studies since the previous review) that evaluated detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (21 studies, 9223 children), tuberculous meningitis (3 studies, 215 children), lymph node tuberculosis (2 studies, 58 children), and rifampicin resistance (3 studies, 130 children). Seventeen studies (74%) took place in countries with a high tuberculosis burden. Overall, risk of bias and applicability concerns were low. Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (microbiological reference standard) Sputum (11 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 75.3% (95% CI 68.9% to 80.8%; 345 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 95.9% (95% CI 92.3% to 97.9%; 2645 children; high-certainty evidence). Gastric aspirate (12 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 69.6% (95% CI 60.3% to 77.6%; 167 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 91.0% (95% CI 82.5% to 95.6%; 1792 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Stool (10 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 68.0% (95% CI 50.3% to 81.7%; 255 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 98.2% (95% CI 96.3% to 99.1%; 2630 children; high-certainty evidence). Nasopharyngeal aspirate (6 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 46.2% (95% CI 34.9% to 57.9%; 94 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 97.5% (95% CI 95.1% to 98.7%; 1259 children; high-certainty evidence). Xpert Ultra sensitivity was lower against CRS than against MRS for all specimen types, while the specificities were similar. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis Meta-analysis was not possible for lymph node tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis due to low study numbers. Interpretation of results For a population of 1000 children, where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis: In sputum: • 112 would be Xpert Ultra positive, of whom 75 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (true positives) and 37 would not (false positives). • 888 would be Xpert Ultra negative, of whom 863 would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (true negatives) and 25 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives).

Detection of rifampicin resistance Three studies with 76 children evaluated detection of rifampicin resistance (sputum only); two of these studies reported no cases and one reported rifampicin resistance in two children. Xpert Ultra sensitivity was moderate in sputum, gastric aspirate, and stool specimens. Nasopharyngeal aspirate had the lowest sensitivity. Xpert Ultra specificity was high against both MRS and CRS. We were unable to determine the accuracy of Xpert Ultra for detecting tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance due to a paucity of data.

[PMID: 41128098] In 2023, an estimated 1.3 million children (aged 0-14 years) became ill with tuberculosis, and 166,000 children (aged 0-15 years) died from the disease. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) is a molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic test that detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2020 and last updated in 2022. Parts of the current update informed the 2024 WHO updated guidance for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra for detecting pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance in children (aged 0-9 years) with presumed tuberculosis.

Bariatric surgery increases rates of colorectal cancer.,bariatric surgery AND colorectal cancer AND surgical outcomes AND risk factors,"40002265,39136945,34275110","[PMID: 40002265] <b>Introduction</b>: Obesity is a chronic disease associated with increased risk for several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The majority of CRC cases are associated with modifiable risk factors. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is a proven, durable, and successful intervention for obesity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of MBS on CRC risk through measures of association, such as relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR). <b>Methods</b>: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Embase was conducted to identify systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses examining the relationship between obesity treated with MBS and CRC incidence. The PICO framework guided inclusion criteria, and three independent reviewers screened articles using Rayyan software. Quality assessment was performed using AMSTAR2. <b>Results</b>: Of 1336 screened articles, 10 SR met inclusion criteria, encompassing 53,452,658 patients. Meta-analyses consistently showed a significant reduction in CRC risk following MBS in patients with severe obesity. Risk reductions were reported by Liu et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.32-0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.01), Chierici et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.28-0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.018), Wilson et al. (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.003), and Pararas et al. (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. For colon cancer, Liu and Chierici both reported an RR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.46-1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.2444) with significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 89%). A trend towards reduced rectal cancer risk (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.40-1.39, <i>p</i> = 0.3523) was noted but limited by fewer studies. Sex-specific analyses revealed protective effects in both sexes, with a more pronounced impact in females (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.37-0.79, <i>p</i> = 0.0014). <b>Conclusions</b>: This umbrella review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of MBS on CRC risk, highlighting a consistent protective association. The findings also indicate a potential risk reduction for both colon and rectal cancer, with a more pronounced effect observed among females compared to males. Given the profound implications of MBS on cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, further high-quality, long-term studies are essential to deepen our understanding and optimize its role in cancer prevention and patient care.

[PMID: 39136945] Bariatric surgery is associated with decreased risk of obesity-related cancer and cardiovascular disease but is typically reserved for patients younger than 60 years. Whether these associations hold for patients who undergo surgery at older ages is uncertain. To determine whether bariatric surgery is associated with a decreased risk of obesity-related cancer and cardiovascular disease in patients who underwent surgery at age 60 years or older. Population-based cohort study of patients from Denmark, Finland, and Sweden who underwent bariatric surgery at age 60 years or older without previous malignant neoplasm or cardiovascular disease between 1989 and 2019. Each patient who underwent surgery was exactly matched to 5 patients with nonoperative treatment for obesity of the same country, sex, and age at the date of surgery. Data were analyzed in December 2023. Receiving treatment for obesity, including bariatric surgery and nonoperative treatments. The main outcome was obesity-related cancer, defined as a composite outcome of breast, endometrial, esophageal, colorectal, and kidney cancer, identified from the national cancer registries. The secondary outcome was cardiovascular disease, defined as a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage, identified from the patient registries. Multivariable Cox regression provided hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs adjusted for diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease, and frailty. In total, 15 300 patients (median [IQR] age, 63 [61-65] years; 10 152 female patients [66.4%]) were included, of which 2550 (16.7%) had bariatric surgery at age 60 or older and 12 750 (83.3%) had nonoperative treatment. During a median (IQR) of 5.8 (2.8-8.5) person-years of follow-up, 658 (4.3%) developed obesity-related cancer and 1436 (9.4%) developed cardiovascular disease. The risk of obesity-related cancer (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64-1.03) and cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-1.01) were similar among who underwent surgery and those who did not. Gastric bypass (1930 patients) was associated with a decreased risk of obesity-related cancer (71 patients [3.7%]; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.97) and cardiovascular disease (159 patients [8.2%]; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99) compared with matched controls (9650 patients; obesity-related cancer: 442 patients [4.6%]; cardiovascular disease: 859 patients [8.9%]). This cohort study found that bariatric surgery in older patients is not associated with lower rates of obesity-related cancer and cardiovascular events, but there was evidence that gastric bypass may be associated with lower risk of both outcomes.

[PMID: 34275110] The impact of pre-bariatric surgery BMI on the incidence of colorectal adenomas in the post-operative period is unknown. Here we aim to evaluate the incidence of colorectal adenomas after bariatric surgery and to assess super morbid obesity (SMO) as a risk factor for post-operative colorectal adenomas. An inception cohort of 1639 patients that underwent bariatric surgery between 2011 and 2019 in a referral center was retrospectively analyzed. SMO was defined as BMI > 50.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the influence of pre-operative BMI on the primary outcome. A total 381 patients (23.2% of the cohort) underwent colonoscopy and included in the analysis. Mean age was 51.1 years (± 10.6) with mean BMI of 42.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (± 6.2), and 49 patients (12.9%) had SMO. Median time to colonoscopy was 3.5 years. One hundred nine patients (28.6%) had colorectal polyps, and 38/109 (34.8%) had advanced adenoma. Two patients had colorectal cancer (CRC). Pre-procedural SMO was associated with diagnosis of colorectal polyp (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.9, p < 0.001) and advanced adenomas (HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.0-8.9, p < 0.001) upon adjustment to previously reported risk factors of CRC. Pre-procedural SMO is associated with increased risk of colorectal adenomas after bariatric surgery compared to obese and morbidly obese individuals. Pre-operative BMI should be incorporated into post-operative screening plan in this population.",3

Obesity is strongly associated with many types of cancer. Few studies have examined the relationship between bariatric surgery and cancer risk. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing bariatric surgery between 2005 and 2012 with follow-up through 2014 using data from a large integrated health insurance and care delivery systems with 5 study sites. The study included 22,198 subjects who had bariatric surgery and 66,427 nonsurgical subjects matched on sex, age, study site, body mass index, and Elixhauser comorbidity index. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were used to examine incident cancer up to 10 years after bariatric surgery compared to the matched nonsurgical patients. After a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, we identified 2543 incident cancers. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery had a 33% lower hazard of developing any cancer during follow-up [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60, 0.74, P < 0.001) compared with matched patients with severe obesity who did not undergo bariatric surgery, and results were even stronger when the outcome was restricted to obesity-associated cancers (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.51, 0.69, P < 0.001). Among the obesity-associated cancers, the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44, 0.77, P < 0.001), colon cancer (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36, 0.97, P = 0.04), endometrial cancer (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.67, P < 0.001), and pancreatic cancer (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22, 0.97, P = 0.04) was each statistically significantly lower among those who had undergone bariatric surgery compared with matched nonsurgical patients. In this large, multisite cohort of patients with severe obesity, bariatric surgery was associated with a lower risk of incident cancer, particularly obesity-associated cancers, such as postmenopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and colon cancer. More research is needed to clarify the specific mechanisms through which bariatric surgery lowers cancer risk.

[PMID: 41187376] There is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of current hospital-based follow-up after treatment for gynaecological cancers. Moreover, patients often report their aftercare needs are unmet. In an era of increasing pressure on healthcare resources - alongside a growing emphasis on patient-empowerment and appropriate care - it is time to reconsider current follow-up practices for gynaecological cancer survivors. This has led to a growing body of research exploring new approaches to follow-up care in gynaecologic oncology. In this scoping review, we aim to explore these alternative follow-up approaches and evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to current follow-up care. The methodological framework for scoping studies by Arksey and O'Malley's was used, further guided by the PRISMA-ScR checklist. A literature search on follow-up care for gynaecological cancers was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid) and Cochrane Library. Included studies employed a comparative method, allowing assessment of alternative approaches relative to current follow-up. Data were charted according to the TIDieR checklist and guide for better reporting of interventions. Eighteen articles were included, identifying three categories of alternative follow-up strategies: nurse-led follow-up, reduced follow-up and patient-initiated follow-up. Across all categories, these approaches showed similar - and sometimes improved - effect on oncological outcomes, quality of life, and/or patient satisfaction, without increased costs and healthcare use. Follow-up care can be delivered in alternative ways, without compromising on patient experiences or oncological safety. This offers the possibility of more cost-effective and resource-efficient healthcare. These findings support the feasibility of using alternative follow-up strategies in gynaecological oncological care.",3
Bariatric surgery leads to positive outcomes in mental health.,bariatric surgery AND mental health outcomes AND mental health benefits AND psychological well-being,"38237524,38302857,32477191","[PMID: 38237524] This study aimed to describe longitudinal trajectories of Total Weight Loss (%TWL), and mental and physical health related quality of life (HRQOL), as well as to identify preoperative psychological predictors of these trajectories. A prospective observational study including Dutch patients treated with metabolic and bariatric surgery (n = 420, age 44.8 ± 10.3 years, 78.6% females) was performed. Trajectories of %TWL and HRQOL from screening to 1-, 2-, and 3-years post-surgery were described using growth mixture modelling. Multivariable and lasso regression models were used to identify predictors. Three trajectories described %TWL, varying in the degree of first-year weight loss. No pre-surgical psychological factors were associated with %TWL trajectories. We identified four physical and five mental HRQOL trajectories. Approximately 25-30% of patients exhibited patterns of initial improvements followed by decline, or persistently low levels of HRQOL. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with these unfavourable physical HRQOL trajectories (OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.04-1.39), adjusted for confounders. Unfavourable mental HRQOL trajectories were predicted by depressive and anxiety symptoms, neuroticism, insecure attachment, and maladaptive coping. In contrast, self-esteem, extraversion, and conscientiousness were associated with favourable mental HRQOL trajectories. Psychological factors did not predict weight loss, but they significantly impacted patient's HRQOL after metabolic and bariatric surgery. A subgroup with unsuccessful HRQOL after surgery was identified, who would benefit from tailored preoperative counselling to optimize surgery outcomes. Metabolic and bariatric surgery may not be universally beneficial for all patients, challenging the conventional approach to surgical interventions for severe obesity and advocating for a more nuanced, individualized assessment of potential candidates.

[PMID: 38302857] The health benefits of bariatric surgery are well documented; however, the occurrence of weight-regain after surgery, along with the development of mental health difficulties poses a question of how contemporary psychology could assist to prepare people living with obesity prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. This research explored individuals' (in the immediate pre-operative and post-operative population) attitudes, beliefs and experiences towards obesity and their journey to bariatric surgery. Seventeen adult participants (males n = 4; age range: 26-64 years) were recruited and participated in a semi-structured interview. Twelve individuals participated prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. Five individuals participated in the early post-operative period (<3 months post-surgery). People living with obesity displayed high optimism for positive outcomes, with participants hoping that bariatric surgery would be different to previous attempts at weight regulation, with there being a clear shift in the locus of control for weight management from self to healthcare professionals. Whilst this is adaptive, there was the presence of seemingly unrealistic optimism, with many pre-surgery participants not relaying the realistic possibility of post-surgery weight-regain. Despite the optimism individuals feel about bariatric surgery, participants felt that the psychological factors influencing eating behaviours are not being addressed by healthcare. These findings suggest that mindfulness, mindful eating, and self-compassion approaches should be incorporated into clinical practice to support weight regulation and adaption to physiological changes after bariatric surgery.

[PMID: 32477191] Bariatric surgery is seldom accessed by people with serious mental illness, despite high rates of obesity in this population. It is sometimes assumed that patients with complex psychiatric histories will have poor post-surgical weight loss or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, although this is unsubstantiated. A qualitative descriptive study to explore personal experiences and the impact of bariatric surgery on physical and mental well-being and life-quality in individuals with serious mental illness. Nine adults with a history of bariatric surgery and concurrent severe depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder were interviewed about their experiences of bariatric surgery and its outcomes using semi-structured interview schedules. Data were transcribed and inductive thematic analysis undertaken. Five broad themes emerged: (1) surgery was highly effective for weight loss, and resulted in subjective improvements in physical health, quality of life, and mental health described as <i>being able to live a life</i>; (2) recovering from surgery was a <i>tough road</i>, notably in the post-operative period where negative sequelae often anteceded benefits; (3) post-operative support was important, but sometimes insufficient, including from families, mental health services, and surgical teams; (4) most considered surgery life-changing, recommending it to others with mental illness and obesity, two had different experiences; (5) participants considered it discriminatory that people with mental illness were not referred or declined weight loss surgery. Participants benefited from bariatric surgery and felt it should be offered to others with mental illness, but with additional care and support.",3
Basophils promote disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).,basophils AND systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) AND pathogenesis AND contribution,"36810600,28801578,27852746","[PMID: 36810600] Recently, the involvement of basophils and IgE-type autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of SLE has been elucidated using mouse models; however, few studies have been conducted in humans. In this study, the role of basophils and anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) IgE in SLE was examined using human samples. The correlation between disease activity and serum levels of anti-dsDNA IgE in SLE was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokines produced by IgE-stimulated basophils from healthy subjects were assessed using RNA sequences. The interaction of basophils and B cells to promote B cell differentiation was investigated using a co-culture system. The ability of basophils from patients with SLE with anti-dsDNA IgE to create cytokines that may be involved in B cell differentiation in response to dsDNA was examined using real-time PCR. Anti-dsDNA IgE levels in the serum of patients with SLE correlated with disease activity. Healthy donor basophils produced IL-3, IL-4 and TGF-β1 after anti-IgE stimulation. Co-culture of B cells with anti-IgE-stimulated basophils increased plasmablasts which were cancelled by neutralizing IL-4. After encountering the antigen, basophils released IL-4 more quickly than follicular helper T cells. Basophils isolated from patients with anti-dsDNA IgE promoted IL-4 expression by adding dsDNA. These results suggest that basophils contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE by promoting B cell differentiation via dsDNA-specific IgE in patients similar to the process described in mouse models.

[PMID: 28801578] Lupus nephritis (LN), one of the most severe outcomes of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is initiated by glomerular deposition of immune-complexes leading to an inflammatory response and kidney failure. Autoantibodies to nuclear antigens and autoreactive B and T cells are central in SLE pathogenesis. Immune mechanisms amplifying this autoantibody production drive flares of the disease. We previously showed that basophils were contributing to LN development in a spontaneous lupus-like mouse model (constitutive Lyn <sup>-/-</sup> mice) and in SLE subjects through their activation and migration to secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) where they amplify autoantibody production. In order to study the basophil-specific mechanisms by which these cells contribute to LN development, we needed to validate their involvement in a genetically independent SLE-like mouse model. Pristane, when injected to non-lupus-prone mouse strains, induces a LN-like disease. In this inducible model, basophils were activated and accumulated in SLOs to promote autoantibody production. Basophil depletion by two distinct approaches dampened LN-like disease, demonstrating their contribution to the pristane-induced LN model. These results enable further studies to decipher molecular mechanisms by which basophils contribute to lupus progression.

[PMID: 27852746] Basophils represent <1% of circulating leukocytes. They play a crucial role during allergy and helminth-induced Th2 responses. However, recent data also suggest a contribution to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Basophils from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus show an activated phenotype, correlating to disease activity. Furthermore, murine basophils or their mediators enhance memory responses and plasma cell (PC) survival, suggesting that they directly modulate the function of B cells. This is highly relevant with respect to human allergy and autoimmunity because a possible modulation of B cell differentiation by basophils could point to new therapeutic targets. Therefore, the interaction between human B cells and basophils and the mechanism underlying this interaction were investigated in detail. Using two different methods to induce PC differentiation, we found that human basophils enhance B cell proliferation, class switching, differentiation into PC, maturation of PC, and production of Igs, especially IgG. Basophil supernatants enhanced the expression of the B cell markers CD23 and CD40, which are important for B cell differentiation into IgG-producing PC. This was mainly IL-4 dependent. IL-3 amplified the number of PC in vitro, and acted synergistically with basophils in enhancing Ab production. Thus, human basophils modulate B cell differentiation into Ab-producing PC. Their contribution as modulators and effectors during allergy and autoimmunity should be considered when designing new therapeutic options.",3
Binding of p53 to enhancer regions (p53BERs) regulates the activity of p53 transcription and cell cycle arrest through the production of p53-dependent eRNAs.,p53 AND enhancer regions AND eRNAs AND cell cycle arrest,"26776159,25813522","[PMID: 26776159] Genome-wide chromatin studies identified the tumor suppressor p53 as both a promoter and an enhancer-binding transcription factor. As an enhancer factor, p53 can induce local production of enhancer RNAs, as well as transcriptional activation of distal neighboring genes. Beyond the regulation of protein-coding genes, p53 has the capacity to regulate long intergenic noncoding RNA molecules (lincRNAs); however, their importance to the p53 tumor suppressive function remains poorly characterized. Here, we identified and characterized a novel p53-bound intronic enhancer that controls the expression of its host, the lincRNA00475 (linc-475). We demonstrate the requirement of linc-475 for the proper induction of a p53-dependent cell cycle inhibitory response. We further confirm the functional importance of linc-475 in the maintenance of CDKN1A/p21 levels, a cell cycle inhibitor and a major p53 target gene, following p53 activation. Interestingly, loss of linc-475 reduced the binding of both p53 and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to the promoter of p21, attenuating its transcription rate following p53 activation. Altogether, our data suggest a direct role of p53-bound enhancer domains in the activation of lincRNAs required for an efficient p53 transcriptional response.

[PMID: 25813522] p53 binds enhancers to regulate key target genes. Here, we globally mapped p53-regulated enhancers by looking at enhancer RNA (eRNA) production. Intriguingly, while many p53-induced enhancers contained p53-binding sites, most did not. As long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are prominent regulators of chromatin dynamics, we hypothesized that p53-induced lncRNAs contribute to the activation of enhancers by p53. Among p53-induced lncRNAs, we identified LED and demonstrate that its suppression attenuates p53 function. Chromatin-binding and eRNA expression analyses show that LED associates with and activates strong enhancers. One prominent target of LED was located at an enhancer region within CDKN1A gene, a potent p53-responsive cell cycle inhibitor. LED knockdown reduces CDKN1A enhancer induction and activity, and cell cycle arrest following p53 activation. Finally, promoter-associated hypermethylation analysis shows silencing of LED in human tumours. Thus, our study identifies a new layer of complexity in the p53 pathway and suggests its dysregulation in cancer.",2
Blocking the interaction between TDP-43 and respiratory complex I proteins ND3 and ND6 prevents TDP-43-induced neuronal loss.,TDP-43 AND ND3 AND ND6 AND respiratory complex I,"27348499,41174170,41174004","[PMID: 27348499] Genetic mutations in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP, also known as TDP-43) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and an increase in the presence of TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP) in the cytoplasm is a prominent histopathological feature of degenerating neurons in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 contributes to ALS pathophysiology remain elusive. Here we have found that TDP-43 accumulates in the mitochondria of neurons in subjects with ALS or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Disease-associated mutations increase TDP-43 mitochondrial localization. In mitochondria, wild-type (WT) and mutant TDP-43 preferentially bind mitochondria-transcribed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding respiratory complex I subunits ND3 and ND6, impair their expression and specifically cause complex I disassembly. The suppression of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization abolishes WT and mutant TDP-43-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss, and improves phenotypes of transgenic mutant TDP-43 mice. Thus, our studies link TDP-43 toxicity directly to mitochondrial bioenergetics and propose the targeting of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization as a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41174170] Motor neuron hyperexcitability is a broadly observed yet poorly understood feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA splicing protein TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are observed in most ALS and FTD patients. Here we show that TDP-43 dysfunction causes mis-splicing of KCNQ2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel (K<sub>v</sub>7.2) that regulates neuronal excitability. Using iPSC-derived neurons and postmortem ALS/FTD brain and spinal cord tissue we find widespread, disease-specific and TDP-43-specific skipping of an exon encoding the KCNQ2 pore domain. The mis-spliced mRNA escapes degradation and is translated into a nonfunctional protein with severely reduced ion conductance that aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum and causes intrinsic hyperexcitability in ALS neuronal models. This event, which correlates with higher phosphorylated TDP-43 levels and earlier age of disease onset in patients, can be rescued by splice-modulating antisense oligonucleotides that dampen hyperexcitability in induced pluripotent stem cell cortical neurons and spinal motor neurons with TDP-43 depletion. Our work reveals that nuclear TDP-43 maintains the fidelity of KCNQ2 expression and function and provides a mechanistic link between established excitability disruption in ALS/FTD patients and TDP-43 dysfunction.

[PMID: 41174004] In multiple neurodegenerative diseases, the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic aggregates of distinct morphologies, including skein-like, small rounded granular and large spherical inclusions. Here, whereas the N-terminal self-oligomerization domain regulates TDP-43 demixing into cytoplasmic droplets, inhibition of N-terminal self-oligomerization domain-mediated oligomerization is shown to promote the formation of skein-like inclusions. Utilizing proximity labelling-mass spectrometry, cellular stresses are shown to induce TDP-43 association with actin-binding proteins that include filamins and α-actinin. Small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of filamin in Drosophila ameliorates cell loss from cytoplasmic TDP-43, consistent with the filamin-TDP-43 interaction enhancing cytotoxicity. TDP-43's association with actin-binding proteins is mediated by BAG3, a HSP70 family nucleotide exchange factor that regulates the proteostasis of actin-binding proteins. BAG2, another HSP70 nucleotide exchange factor, facilitates the formation of small, rounded TDP-43 inclusions. We demonstrate that both TDP-43 self-oligomerization and its binding partners, including HSP70 and cochaperones BAG2 and BAG3, drive the formation of the different types of TDP-43 inclusion.",3
Bone marrow cells don't contribute to adult macrophage compartments.,Bone marrow AND Cells AND Macrophage AND Adult,"40986027,40815351,40875958","[PMID: 40986027] This study aimed to investigate the role of pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) in macrophage-driven allergic rhinitis (AR) pathogenesis using both in vivo and in vitro experimental models. Myeloid-specific PKM2 knockout (PKM2<sup>mye-KO</sup>) and littermate control (PKM2<sup>WT</sup>) mice were used, along with human nasal mucosa samples from AR patients and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). BMDMs were treated with the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 (100 µM) or vehicle prior to house dust mite (HDM) stimulation. Histological and immunological analyses were performed on human and murine tissues. Cytokine expression, nuclear translocation, and metabolic markers were assessed in BMDMs following HDM stimulation. Statistical significance was evaluated using appropriate tests (e.g., Student's t-test or ANOVA). PKM2 levels and macrophage infiltration were elevated in AR patient nasal mucosa. PKM2<sup>mye-KO</sup> mice showed reduced allergic inflammation, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α), and suppressed STAT3 activation compared to controls. TEPP-46 treatment attenuated HDM-induced cytokine release and nuclear PKM2 translocation. PKM2 regulates macrophage-mediated inflammation in AR via STAT3-dependent pathways, suggesting its nuclear translocation and interaction with STAT3 as potential therapeutic targets for allergic diseases.

[PMID: 40815351] Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.

[PMID: 40875958] Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a potential cellular therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been suggested that MSCs from patients with MS have lower immunomodulatory properties than those from healthy controls (HCs). The aims of this study were to compare the immunomodulatory abilities of MSCs from patients with MS and HCs against autologous immune cells and to identify potential targets affecting this ability. MSCs were obtained by bone marrow aspiration from 5 people with MS and 7 HCs. Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated in monoculture or co-culture with MSCs and tested for T-cell expression of IL-17, IFN-γ, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by flow cytometry. Supernatants of monoculture unstimulated MSCs were tested for a panel of cytokines and chemokines using multiplex array or individual ELISA. Gene expression profiling in MSCs was studied using Lexogen QuantSeq RNA-seq platform and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The MSCs from HCs reduced the proportion of autologous T cells expressing IL-17 (Th17, <i>p</i> = 0.046), IFN-γ (Th1, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and GM-CSF (<i>p</i> = 0.012), whereas MSCs from patients with MS had an opposite effect, increasing both autologous Th17 cells (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and GM-CSF-expressing T cells (<i>p</i> = 0.03), with no changes in Th1 cell abundance. Unstimulated MSCs from patients with MS produced less IL-10 (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and more osteopontin (OPN) (<i>p</i> = 0.002) than those from HCs. Gene expression profiling suggested an increase of ADAM28 in the MS MSCs. This was further confirmed at mRNA (by quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]) and protein (by flow cytometry) levels. Co-cultures of MS MSCs and autologous PBMCs in the presence of natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds α4β1 and blocks its interaction with both ADAM28 and OPN, resulted in a reduction of Th17 cells. In addition, adding IL-10 to the co-cultures abrogated the increase in Th17 cells, potentially interfering with MS MSC inflammatory effect. Our results suggest that blocking ADAM-28 and OPN interaction with cognate receptors or increasing IL-10 reduces the proinflammatory potential of MSCs from people with MS. Similar approaches could be used in clinical MSC treatments.",3
Broadly HIV-1 Neutralizing Antibodies (bnAb) 10EB have no affinity for phospholipids.,bnAb 10EB AND phospholipid binding AND lack of affinity AND HIV-1 bnAb,"41177463,41174039,41172968","[PMID: 41177463] Sustained serum levels of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are crucial for effective passive immunization against infectious diseases as protection persists only while these bnAbs remain at adequate concentrations within the body. Current obstacles, such as poor pharmacokinetics (PK) and burdensome administration, must be overcome to make bnAbs a viable option for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. In this work, we explore how a polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel depot technology can be engineered to prolong protein delivery and enable drug exposure on the order of weeks to months. In-vivo studies in mice and rats demonstrate extended protein release compared to bolus administration, and modeling efforts predict the impact of both the elimination half-life of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and hydrogel depot volume on overall pharmacokinetics. Moreover, flow cytometry characterization reveals that immune cell infiltration into the hydrogel depot can result in faster-than-expected release of antibody cargo on account of active transport via cellular uptake. We then demonstrate that co-formulation of antibodies with an anti-inflammatory agent reduces cellular infiltration and resulting active transport, further extending delivery and pharmacokinetics. Finally, multicompartmental modeling predicts the human PK profiles of clinically relevant HIV bnAbs delivered via subcutaneous hydrogel injection. These findings aid in the development of next generation hydrogel materials that stabilize and slowly release bnAbs for long-term pre-exposure immunoprophylaxis.

[PMID: 41174039] Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective in treating several advanced cancers, but these treatments have had limited success in metastatic ovarian cancer. Here we engineered liposomal nanoparticles carrying a poly-ʟ-arginine/poly-ʟ-glutamate coating that promotes their binding and retention on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. Covalent anchoring of the potent immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) to phospholipid headgroups of the liposome core enabled the polymer-coated particles to concentrate IL-12 in disseminated ovarian cancer tumours following intraperitoneal administration. Shedding of the layer-by-layer coating and serum-protein-mediated extraction of IL-12-conjugated lipids from the liposomal core over time enabled IL-12 to disseminate in the tumour bed following rapid nanoparticle localization in tumour nodules. Optimized IL-12-polymer-coated nanoparticles promoted robust T cell accumulation in ascites and tumours in mouse models, extending survival compared with free IL-12 and sensitizing tumours to immune checkpoint inhibitors, eliciting strong immune responses and immune memory. Overall, these findings support the potential of these polymer-coated nanoparticles for the sustained delivery of IL-12 to disseminated metastatic ovarian cancer.

[PMID: 41172968] Gram-negative bacteria feature an asymmetric outer membrane, composed of phospholipids in the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or lipooligosaccharides (LOS) in the outer leaflet, which underpins virulence and antibiotic resistance. Conventional LPS assays like the Limulus amebocyte lysate test face ethical and practical challenges, motivating the development of aptamer-based detection. Here, we probe the interaction of the LA27 DNA aptamer (Kd ≈ 46 nM) with biomimetic membranes incorporating LOS/LPS from Akkermansia muciniphila, Flavobacterium sp. Root935, and Paenalcaligenes hominis strains. Asymmetric supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) and symmetric large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were characterized by neutron reflectometry (NR), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). NR confirmed preserved bilayer asymmetry and revealed that LA27 deeply penetrates Akkermansia LOS bilayers, evidenced by increased core hydration and structural disruption, whereas interactions with Flavobacterium LOS are moderate, and those with Paenalcaligenes LPS are confined to surface adhesion due to extensive LPS O-antigen chains. SANS and DLS of LUVs corroborated these modes: Akkermansia vesicles showed negligible changes in lamellar thickness and hydrodynamic radius, consistent with insertion, while those containing Flavobacterium LOS and Paenalcaligenes LPS exhibited significant increases in both size-related metrics, indicative of surface binding for those latter cases. These results elucidate how polysaccharide composition and supramolecular architecture of LOS/LPS govern aptamer affinity and specificity, providing a rigorous framework for nano-bio interface studies and laying the groundwork for selective, aptamer-based endotoxin sensing platforms.",3

A hollow-structured h-CdS coupled with TiO<sub>2</sub> formed a highly efficient heterojunction that enhanced light absorption, light scattering, and charge separation, resulting in significantly improved photoelectric conversion efficiency. A single-atom Fe-MNC nanozyme possessing both peroxidase- and oxidase-like activities was synthesized via a cascade anchoring strategy, successfully catalyzing a biocatalytic precipitation (BCP) reaction for signal amplification.

[PMID: 41186846] Metabolic Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) algorithms have become invaluable tools for exploring deep into the complex dynamics of cellular metabolism. Monitoring subcellular parameters is of interest, particularly during photodynamic therapy (PDT), to enhance treatment efficacy. By joining together Metabolic FLIM with PLIM, it is possible to evaluate cellular metabolic states, such as oxygen consumption, redox states, pH levels, and energy production pathways. The aim of this work is to use NADH FLIM and PLIM techniques to distinguish different metabolic pattern signatures in tumor and normal cell lines using a PLIM pH sensitive complex from the family of phosphorescent [(N^C)<sub>2</sub>Ir(N^N)]<sup>+</sup> complexes. This investigation used a combination of 2-photon (2P) excited FLIM and PLIM techniques, coupled with time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) detection. All the data were collected from living cells and were analyzed through exponential fitting. For the pattern segmentation we have used the phasor plot approach. By constructing a calibration curve and simultaneously acquiring NADH-FLIM and PLIM data from our pH sensor, we were able to identify metabolic regions and distinguished different pattern signatures in tumor and normal cell lines. This combined approach provides a comprehensive view of the tumor microenvironment, offering critical insights into parameters that influence photosensitizer localization, ROS generation, and therapeutic response. By identifying metabolic and pH heterogeneity at the single-cell level, this method contributes to improving the selectivity, precision, and overall efficacy of PDT treatments.

[PMID: 41186834] Evolution has optimized proteins over time by the incorporation of precise and context-specific amino acid substitutions adapted to structural and functional demands. We have reconceptualized this principle using deep learning to engineer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting immune checkpoints PD-1 and LAG-3. These two checkpoints are targeted synergistically in combination immunotherapy to minimize cancer cell evasion. From the established antibodies, the best set was selected based on their clinical validation. These served as templates to improve binding affinity and therapeutic potential in the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. To guide antibody design, we formulated inverse modeling pipeline using message passing graph neural network for protein sequence design given a fixed backbone structure. This led to the prediction of functionally viable substitutions at the receptor-antibody interface. Resulting variant models were filtered based on physicochemical accuracy, evolutionary feasibility, empirical validation, geometric complementarity and machine learning guided mutation prediction, ensuring structural integrity and enhanced performance. In addition, thermostability and immunogenicity analyses of the filtered ones were carried out. Ultimately, the top candidates were subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations leading to post simulation trajectory analysis including stability, interaction and energy decomposition analysis. After a robust computational evaluation, seven variants exhibited improved network stability and superior binding as compared to their respective references. Moreover, we have also added negative control to reinforce the novelty and importance of our framework. Our results establish a robust and scalable framework to design ICIs and underscores potential leads having improved binding, concertedly targeting PD-1 and LAG-3, paving the path for next-generation immunotherapy.",3

[PMID: 41182434] CD40 is a T-cell co-stimulatory receptor targeted by next-generation immunotherapies. We conducted a pan-cancer transcriptome analysis of CD40, its ligand, and related immune markers to evaluate co-expression patterns and clinical outcomes. We analyzed transcriptome data for CD40, its ligand, and other common checkpoints and co-stimulators (PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4, LAG-3, ICOS, CD27, CD28, OX40, and GITR). RNA expression was classified as high (75-100th percentile), moderate (25-74th), or low (0-24th) against a reference population of 735 previously tested solid tumors. Of 514 patients, 114 (22%) showed high, 247 (48%) moderate, and 153 (30%) low CD40 RNA expression. High CD40 expression was most frequent in liver and bile duct (42%), pancreatic (42%), and ovarian (40%) cancers. Both high CD40 and low-moderate CD40 ligand expression-potentially conducive to CD40 agonist therapy-was most frequent in ovarian (33%) and pancreatic (24%) cancer. In both UCSD (N = 514) and TCGA (N = 10,953) cohorts, high CD40 expression significantly correlated with high CD28 and GITR. High CD40 RNA levels were not prognostic for overall survival (OS) from metastatic disease (P = 0.2) (n = 272 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-naïve patients). High CD40 expression correlated with longer OS from immunotherapy initiation (n = 217 ICI-treated patients; P = 0.04, univariable analysis), but not multivariable analysis, suggesting it may not be an independent predictive biomarker. High CD40 expression correlated with liver and bile duct, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers, as well as with CD28 and GITR transcripts. Immune marker co-expression in individual patients merits further exploration for the development of CD40-based and other immunotherapy interventions.

In dMMR CRC patients, enrichment of T<sub>PEX</sub>-like CD103N cells is associated with a favorable prognosis following anti-PD-1 therapy, suggesting their association with clinical outcome. Our findings identify an expanded population of CD103N cells exhibiting a T<sub>PEX</sub> phenotype with anti-tumor potential in pMMR CRC, highlighting their promise as therapeutic targets for recruitment into the tumor microenvironment to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.",3
CD28 signals regulate trafficking of murine auto-reactive T cells into target tissues.,CD28 signaling AND auto-reactive T cells AND murine AND target tissues,41187220,"[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.",1
Ca2+ cycling controls whole-body energy homeostasis in beige fat.,calcium cycling AND energy homeostasis AND beige fat AND metabolism,"32849287,29131158,40380026","[PMID: 32849287] Mammals have two types of thermogenic adipocytes: brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes. Thermogenic adipocytes express high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) to dissipates energy in the form of heat by uncoupling the mitochondrial proton gradient from mitochondrial respiration. There is much evidence that UCP1 is the center of BAT thermogenesis and systemic energy homeostasis. Recently, UCP1 independent thermogenic pathway identified in thermogenic adipocytes. Importantly, the thermogenic pathways are different in brown and beige adipocytes. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 2b calcium cycling mechanism is selective to beige adipocytes. It remains unknown how the multiple thermogenic mechanisms are coordinately regulated.

[PMID: 29131158] Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) plays a central role in nonshivering thermogenesis in brown fat; however, its role in beige fat remains unclear. Here we report a robust UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism in beige fat that involves enhanced ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2). Inhibition of SERCA2b impairs UCP1-independent beige fat thermogenesis in humans and mice as well as in pigs, a species that lacks a functional UCP1 protein. Conversely, enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling by activation of α1- and/or β3-adrenergic receptors or the SERCA2b-RyR2 pathway stimulates UCP1-independent thermogenesis in beige adipocytes. In the absence of UCP1, beige fat dynamically expends glucose through enhanced glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid metabolism and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity for ATP-dependent thermogenesis through the SERCA2b pathway; beige fat thereby functions as a 'glucose sink' and improves glucose tolerance independently of body weight loss. Our study uncovers a noncanonical thermogenic mechanism through which beige fat controls whole-body energy homeostasis via Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling.

[PMID: 40380026] Adipose tissue thermogenesis has emerged as a prominent research focus for the treatment of metabolic diseases, particularly through mitochondrial uncoupling, which oxidizes nutrients to produce heat rather than synthesizing ATP. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) has garnered significant attention as a core protein mediating non-shivering thermogenesis(NST). However, recent studies indicate that energy dissipation can also occur via UCP1-independent thermogenesis, partially driven by futile metabolic cycles. These cycles involve ATP depletion coupled with reversible energy reactions, resulting in futile energy expenditure. Unlike classical UCP1-mediated thermogenesis, futile cycling is not confined to brown and beige adipose tissue, suggesting a broader range of therapeutic targets. These findings open new avenues for targeting these pathways to enhance metabolic health. This review explores the characteristics and distinctions of the primary metabolic organs (adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle) involved in the futile cycles of thermogenesis. It further elaborates on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying calcium, creatine, and lipid cycling, emphasizing their strengths, limitations, and roles beyond thermogenesis.",3
Ca2+ cycling is a UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism.,Ca²⁺ cycling AND Thermogenesis AND Mitochondrial function AND Brown adipose tissue,"40199326,36948352,35791624","[PMID: 40199326] Adipose tissue thermogenesis contributes to energy balance via mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and UCP1-independent pathways. Among UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms, one involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling via SERCA2b in adipose tissue; however, the underlying molecular basis remains elusive. Here, we report that an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored peptide, C4orf3 (also known as another regulin [ALN]), uncouples SERCA2b Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport from its ATP hydrolysis, rendering the SERCA2b-C4orf3 complex exothermic. Loss of C4orf3/ALN improved the energetic efficiency of SERCA2b-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport without affecting SERCA2 expression, thereby reducing adipose tissue thermogenesis and increasing the adiposity of mice. Notably, genetic depletion of C4orf3 resulted in compensatory activation of UCP1-dependent thermogenesis following cold challenge. We demonstrated that genetic loss of both C4orf3 and Ucp1 additively impaired cold tolerance in vivo. Together, this study identifies C4orf3 as the molecular resistor to SERCA2b-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> import that plays a key role in UCP1-independent thermogenesis and energy balance.

[PMID: 36948352] The activation of brown fat and induction of beige adipocytes, so-called non-shivering thermogenesis, is emerging as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in obesity management. Our previous report demonstrated that β-carotene (BC) induces beige adipocytes to increase UCP1-dependent thermogenic activity. However, the UCP1-independent thermogenic effect of BC on adipose tissues remains unexplored. In this study, we examined the effects of BC on UCP1-independent thermogenic activity with a focus on the ATP-consuming futile cycles in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. BC increased intracellular calcium levels and stimulated the expression of calcium cycling-related proteins, including sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) 2b, ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK2) in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes. In addition, BC stimulated thermogenesis by activating the creatine metabolism-related thermogenic pathway. Moreover, BC activated β-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1), which efficiently cleaved BC to retinal and consequently converted to its transcriptionally active form retinoic acid. These BC conversion products also exhibited thermogenic effects comparable to a similar level of BC. The mechanistic study revealed that retinal exhibited thermogenic activity independently of retinoic acid and retinoic acid-mediated thermogenesis was resulted partly from conversion of retinal. Moreover, BC activated α1-AR and UCP1-independent thermogenic effectors independently of UCP1 expression. In conclusion, the thermogenic response to BC and its conversion products in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes involves two interacting pathways, one mediated via β3-adrenergic receptors (β3-AR) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the other via α1-AR and increases in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels activated by calcium regulatory proteins.

[PMID: 35791624] Brown and beige adipocytes produce heat and control systemic energy via non-shivering thermogenesis. Historically, thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes was thought to be exclusively through a mitochondria-localized protein, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). However, recent studies identified UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms in adipocytes. Importantly, UCP1-independent pathways significantly contribute to systemic energy and glucose homeostasis. The finding of UCP1-independent mechanisms provided new opportunities to target the pathways in vivo. In this review, we discuss the current understandings of thermogenic mechanisms in adipocytes with a focus on Ca2+ futile cycling.",3

Cancers that initially benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor targeted therapies later become refractory through several mechanisms.,Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor AND Targeted Therapies AND Cancer Resistance AND Mechanisms,"41168408,41152910,41166929","[PMID: 41168408] In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), the emergence of acquired resistance remains a significant challenge. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of resistance is crucial for developing novel strategies to overcome or delay therapeutic escape. To this end, this study aimed to identify key drivers of EGFR-TKIs resistance and explore actionable targets for intervention. We investigated resistance mechanisms by integrating CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide screening with tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic analysis, and virtually screened bioactive small molecule libraries to identify compounds capable of restoring EGFR-TKIs sensitivity. The multi-omics approach revealed that CCT2 is a critical mediator of resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer, with higher expression of CCT2 observed in resistant cells compared to sensitive cells. Mechanistically, CCT2 recruits tripartite motif-containing protein 28 (TRIM28) to catalyze SUMO2 modification of thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 1 (TMX1), inhibiting its ubiquitination and enhancing protein stability. This post-translational modification (PTM) promotes TMX1-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) clearance, thereby conferring resistance. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition with the compound HY-10127, identified through virtual screening, effectively restored EGFR-TKIs sensitivity in resistant cell lines and delayed the development of resistance in xenograft models. The findings establish the CCT2/TRIM28/TMX1/ROS axis as a novel resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutated lung cancer, and targeting this pathway with HY-10127 represents a promising strategy to overcome resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs, providing preclinical rationale for clinical translation. These discoveries advance our understanding of molecular resistance mechanisms and offer potential therapeutic targets for improving lung cancer prognosis.

[PMID: 41152910] Despite an initial favorable response of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to osimertinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), resistance to this drug inevitably develops. Whereas genetic mechanisms for such acquired resistance have been identified, the molecular mediators of resistance induction have remained unclear. To identify factors that mediate induction of osimertinib resistance, we studied clinical samples from individuals with EGFR-mutant NSCLC as well as cell lines including PC-9 and H1975. Methods adopted included transcriptomics analysis and immunohistochemistry of pretreatment NSCLC specimens, spatial transcriptomics analysis, a cell viability assay, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR analysis, RNA sequencing, immunoblot analysis, comprehensive proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, and a mouse xenograft tumor model. Transcriptomics analysis of pretreatment clinical specimens identified IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3) as a gene specifically upregulated in patients with a poor response to osimertinib treatment. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that patients with IFITM3-positive tumors experienced a shorter progression-free survival on osimertinib treatment. Spatial transcriptomics and other analyses further revealed that IFITM3 expression in tumor cells was increased in response to cytokines derived from the tumor microenvironment (TME) during osimertinib treatment. IFITM3 was found to promote the development of osimertinib resistance in NSCLC cell lines through interaction with MET and activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, combined treatment with a MET inhibitor suppressed the development of osimertinib resistance in a mouse xenograft tumor model. Our findings reveal that upregulation of IFITM3 driven by TME cytokines represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of osimertinib resistance, and they suggest that targeting of the IFITM3-MET axis may improve EGFR-TKI treatment outcome for EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

[PMID: 41166929] Although treatments for HNSCC have improved, the cancer is still challenging because many patients tend to develop the disease again nearby and often have poor recovery. Since drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells display a wide range of types and unique genetic characteristics, nonhormonal endocrine therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, are ineffective in eliminating these cells. DTP cells evade elimination by entering a reversible dormant state characterized by altered metabolism, enhanced DNA repair capacity, and modified immune escape mechanisms, all of which promote the cells' survival and treatment failure. Platinum-based chemotherapy, widely prescribed for HNSCC, reduces tumor size but fails to confer long-term benefits because of the strong treatment resistance of DTP cells. These cells also exhibit resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors by activating alternative signaling pathways. Alternative survival pathways are also activated in DTP cells when targeted therapies such as those using epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are used. Although programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors are exciting new treatments, their effect is hampered by DTP cells that affect the immune system. This review examines the ways DTP cells make HNSCC tumor cells resistant to treatment by looking at metabolic reprogramming, DNA methylation alterations and the microenvironment of the tumor. This review further explores strategies for targeting metabolic dependencies, inhibiting DNA repair, and combining therapeutic approaches, all of which can mitigate DTP cell-mediated recurrence. Advancing strategies that specifically target DTP cells could enhance HNSCC management by reducing recurrence and improving overall prognosis.",3
Cardiac tissue-resident macrophages directly contribute to electrical activity.,cardiac tissue-resident macrophages AND macrophage function AND electrical activity AND contribution,"41187382,41187318","[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187318] Synchronous oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a unique clinical entity with potential benefit from radical local consolidative therapy (LCT). However, robust tools to stratify patients most likely to benefit from radical LCT are lacking. We identified patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC from the SEER 17 registry (2018-2021). Radical LCT was defined as surgical resection of the primary tumor (±metastasectomy) and/or radiotherapy. Patients were stratified accordingly. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox models with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding. A weighted random survival forest (RSF) model and SHAP analysis were applied to capture nonlinear interactions and key prognostic determinants. Model discrimination was assessed by C-index, AUC, and integrated Brier score (IBS). Among 5,377 patients, 221 received radical LCT. The radical LCT group was younger, had earlier T stage, smaller tumors, and more frequent brain metastases. Median overall survival (mOS) was significantly longer in the radical LCT group than the no-LCT group (27 vs. 7 months; p<0.001), with maximal benefit among those also receiving chemotherapy (mOS: 30 months). The RSF model outperformed Cox regression in training (C-index: 0.752 vs. 0.735) with similar validation results. Chemotherapy (HR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.36-0.46; p<0.001) and radical LCT (HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.91; p = 0.018) were independent favorable factors. SHAP analysis demonstrated that radical LCT and chemotherapy contributed most to risk reduction in the survival prediction model, with consistent protective effects observed across different age, T stage, and histological subgroups. This multi-center, population-based study is the first to establish and internally validate a machine learning-based risk stratification tool for patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC. Radical LCT, particularly when combined with chemotherapy, was associated with improved OS in this cohort. The model may facilitate preliminary risk stratification and assist multidisciplinary management, but external validation and integration of key clinical and molecular variables are needed before clinical application. Prospective multicenter validation is warranted.",2
Cellular clocks are associated with mitosis timing in NIH 3T3 cells.,cellular clocks AND mitosis timing AND circadian rhythm AND NIH 3T3 cells,"41186576,41185464,41184763","[PMID: 41186576] Circadian clocks orchestrate the daily rhythms of physiological functions. The underlying mechanisms of circadian clocks are highly conserved across species, driven by endogenous transcriptional-translational feedback loops. CLOCK, a central transcription factor in circadian regulation, requires coregulatory factors and histone modification dynamics to regulate downstream clock-controlled gene expression. In this study, we identify the Drosophila polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) as a previously unrecognized regulator of the circadian transcriptional machinery. We found that knocking down different subunits of Paf1C in pacemaker neurons lengthens the circadian locomotion period. Specifically, downregulation of rtf1, a core subunit of Paf1C, significantly dampens the amplitude of circadian rhythms and extends the locomotor period. This effect is primarily attributed to a reduction in the pacemaker protein PERIOD (PER), mediated through decreased per transcription. Indeed, the overexpression of per in pacemaker neurons rescues the circadian defects caused by rtf1 downregulation. Mechanistically, we identified that rtf1 enhances CLK-mediated per transcription activation. RTF1 physically interacts with CLK, thus promoting its occupancy on the promoters of per and other clock genes. Furthermore, the H3K4me3 methyltransferase SET1 forms complex with CLK and RTF1, facilitates their interaction, and thereby increases H3K4me3 levels at the per/tim promoter to promote their expression. Notably, we discovered that human RTF1 physically interacts with BMAL1/CLOCK and affects the circadian rhythms in U2OS cells, indicating a potentially conserved mechanism in mammals. Together, our results demonstrate that RTF1 regulates circadian rhythms by modulating CLK occupancy and H3K4me3 levels at pacemaker gene promoters.

[PMID: 41185464] Circadian rhythm is an essential biological process that synchronises physiological activities with environmental light/dark cycles. However, its regulatory mechanisms in tooth development remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in circadian rhythm regulation and daily mineralization during tooth development using immunofluorescence, circadian rhythm tracking, and genetic models. Spatiotemporal analysis of rat dental germs revealed that oscillatory expression patterns of p75NTR closely aligned with clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1, Per2), mineralization-related factors, and odontogenesis-related factors. p75NTR knockout mice (p75NTR<sup>ExIII-/-</sup>) exhibited reduced body weight, lower melatonin levels, delayed incisor eruption, decreased daily mineralization width, and downregulation of core clock genes. Mechanistically, p75NTR overexpression in immortalised stem cells from the dental apical papilla (iSCAPs) upregulated casein kinase 2 (CK2) expression, enhanced PER2 phosphorylation, and promoted nuclear p-PER2 accumulation, while CK2 inhibition partially reversed these effects. In vivo, CK2 inhibition via quinalizarin exacerbated incisor eruption defects in p75NTR<sup>ExIII-/-</sup> mice. These findings demonstrate that p75NTR regulates circadian-driven mineralization and tooth morphogenesis, probably via the CK2/PER2 pathway, providing critical insight into the interplay between the circadian rhythm and dental development.

[PMID: 41184763] Bamboo, widely distributed in Southeast Asian and East Asia, is a palatable food resource, with its nutritional and low-fat properties, and functions in economic and ecological balance. As an important food source, some bamboo shoots often synthesize bitter chemicals in a special developing period or in a particular position of the shoot, which depends on the edible bamboo species. In this research, we focus on a sympodium bamboo, Bambusa oldhamii Munro, located in Southeast China, which has special biological properties. When the shoots are harvested underground, the shoots taste tender and tasty enough, but when the shoots erupt out of the soil surface with sunlight for days, the shoot has a little bitterness in the tip portion. This research conducts multi-omics approaches to investigate the bitter flavor formation with multiple developing phases of the shoot in B. oldhamii Munro. The PacBio and Hi-C technologies were used to sequence the hexaploid species, B. oldhamii Munro, for de novo genome assembly. The assembled genome size of B. oldhamii is 1,446 Mb, with a scaffold-level N50 equal to 38,936,033 bp. A total of 88,140 genes in the genome were acquired, and about 53.89% of the genome is occupied by repeat components. The BUSCO score is 96.59%, suggesting a relatively complete and reliable assembly. Three subgenomes (ABC) include 35 pseudo-chromosomes based on the synteny analysis with another hexaploid species, Dendrocalamus latiflorus. The technologies of transcriptome analysis on the genome level and widely targeted metabolome were used to classify the key transcription factors and key bitter metabolites that account for the bamboo shoot flavor transition of B. oldhamii from underground to above ground, especially in the multiple developing phases. We finally mined out several bitter metabolites belonging to amino acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, purines, and other families, and several related pathways of Circadian rhythm, plant hormone signal transduction, flavonoid biosynthesis, and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis. Additionally, from joint analysis between bitter metabolites and transcription factors, we found that the family of bHLH and HB- transcription factors might influence the shoot bitter flavor transition and formation via influencing the accumulation of bitter metabolites in B. oldhamii. In this research, we used Multi-omics methods to investigate the bitter flavor formation and transition in the shoot of B. oldhamii and hypothesized a simple model about this biological process. In a suitable circumstance (warm temperature and sunlight), the environment signals transduction influences the expression of transcription factor (bHLH, HB-, and others) which activate or suppress the expression level of genes or enzymes in the bitter flavor metabolites related pathways (biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, amino acid metabolism, biosynthesis of flavonoid, flavone, flavonol and isoflavonoid, plant hormone signal transduction and others), then causing the contents of bitter flavor metabolites (flavonoids, amino acids, terpenoids, cyanogenic glycosides and others) increase or decrease. This phenomenon influences the bitter flavor formation or transition in the shoot of B. oldhamii.",3

Publicly available gene datasets from gestational days 0, 21, 42, 56, 63, and 105 were integrated to investigate maternal gene expression changes across gestation. Coexpression clustering identified four clusters, with three enriched for relevant biological processes, including interferon response genes from day 0 to 21, oxidative phosphorylation at day 42, and immune response genes by day 105. Additionally, maternal blood samples from 20 recipient cows carrying female fetuses derived from in vitro-produced embryos were subjected to RNA sequencing. Unsupervised weighted gene co-expression network analysis of these data identified four modules of coexpressed genes correlated with calf BW (p < 0.05). Supervised analysis revealed 189 differentially expressed genes (DEG; FDR < 0.05) associated with calf BW. The 106 positively associated DEG enriched phosphorylation and protein modification, while the 83 negatively associated DEG enriched immune processes. Biomarker genes were best determined using genes affected by gestational age and DEG, yielding 26 and 17 biomarkers, respectively, with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.88 and 0.75 for predicting calf BW. In conclusion, transcriptomic analysis of the maternal blood identified biomarkers associated with calf BW and may have application in other species.

[PMID: 41186192] Adipocytes undergo dramatic changes during to support the development of the mammary gland. However, their precise role and mechanism of action in pregnancy and lactation remain poorly understood. To explore how adipocyte elimination influences alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in the mammary gland, we mated mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) to those bearing the adiponectin (adipoq) cre. Using this mouse model of inducible and transient adipocyte ablation, we demonstrated that adipocyte loss promotes early development of AECs. During pregnancy, adipocyte loss induces activation of STAT5 through integrin β1/RAC1, which promotes early differentiation of AECs. During lactation, adipocyte loss results in upregulation of TGFβ/WNT5A expression, thereby triggering early apoptosis of AECs. Collectively, our findings reveal an unanticipated, stage-specific regulatory function of adipocytes in orchestrating AECs development during pregnancy and lactation.

[PMID: 41186400] The actinomycete <i>Actinoplanes missouriensis</i> grows as a substrate mycelium and forms terminal sporangia containing a few hundred spores surrounded by an unidentified matrix called the sporangium matrix. Upon contact with water, sporangia release spores through a process called sporangium dehiscence, in which the opaque sporangium envelope becomes transparent, and sporangia swell with water, followed by spore release via the breakage of the outer envelope. In this study, we identified two paralogous hydrolases (GimA and GimB) required for sporangium dehiscence. Transcription of <i>gimA</i> and <i>gimB</i> is activated during sporangium dehiscence by a global transcriptional activator, TcrA. GimA and GimB are composed of an N-terminal signal peptide, glycoside hydrolase domain, and galactose-binding-like domain. No phenotypic changes were observed between the wild-type strain and single-gene null mutants of <i>gimA</i> and <i>gimB</i>. The double mutant (Δ<i>gimA</i>Δ<i>gimB</i> strain) formed normal sporangia, but spores were not released under dehiscence-inducing conditions; the sporangium envelope became transparent, but spores remained in the sporangium matrix. The release of spores from Δ<i>gimA</i>Δ<i>gimB</i> sporangia was immediately induced by the exogenous addition of recombinant GimA or GimB. Thin-layer chromatography revealed that GimA and GimB cleaved the substrate polysaccharide at different positions. Null mutants of genes within a putative polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster adjacent to <i>gimB</i> generated distorted sporangia, and no sporangium matrix was produced in one of the mutants. We conclude that a major component of the sporangium matrix is a polysaccharide consisting of repeating oligosaccharides and that GimA and GimB hydrolyze this polysaccharide to release spores during sporangium dehiscence.IMPORTANCEDispersal by means of zoospores is a common feature in the life cycle of many lower eukaryotes, including chytrid fungi, oomycetes, and some bacteria of actinomycetes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zoospore release from (zoo)sporangia remain largely unknown. Here, we revealed that two paralogous glycoside hydrolases (GimA and GimB) play essential roles in the release of spores, which can swim in aquatic environments as zoospores, from sporangia in <i>Actinoplanes missouriensis</i>, a filamentous soil-inhabiting bacterium. During sporangium dehiscence, GimA and GimB are produced and secreted extracellularly to hydrolyze the polysaccharide component of the sporangium matrix that encapsulates the spores. This study clarifies an unprecedented molecular mechanism in the process of zoospore release from the sporangia.",3

The patient was brought to our emergency department for management 4 hours after injection. He was fully conscious and had normal vital signs. Systemic review showed mild dyspnea, abdominal pain and right wrist pain over the injection site. The only abnormal physical finding was erythema over the injection site and epigastric tenderness. Laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver and renal function, and electrolytes initially yielded normal results. Urinalysis showed normal findings except a positive urine paraquat test (4+). The initial plasma paraquat concentration was 0.51 μg/mL. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent one session of charcoal hemoperfusion therapy. Acute kidney injury developed on the fourth day after intoxication, with the level of serum creatinine rising rapidly from 0.96 to 4.57 mg/dL and the daily urine output decreased noticeably from > 2000 to 900 mL. The serum creatinine level improved gradually with adequate fluid supplementation. The patient was discharged 13 days later in a stable condition. Intravenous paraquat intoxication is rare. Patients who suffer from intravenous intoxication may not directly suffer from mucosal irritation, but the clinical onset of systemic effects is more immediate and lethal. The prognosis of paraquat poisoning is determined by the time of poisoning and the plasma paraquat concentration before treatment. Proudfoot's curve provides a simple method of predicting the survival rate. The most effective mode of management is extracorporeal therapy, and immunosuppressive or antioxidant therapies have shown insufficient evidence of benefit.

[PMID: 41187384] Treatment for gaming disorder (GD) can be challenging due to comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

A Markov-based cost-utility model using a third-party payer perspective compared concurrent and maintenance treatment strategies incorporating dostarlimab and trastuzumab for newly diagnosed stage III-IV endometrial cancer: chemotherapy alone; 3 universal immunotherapy strategies (universal concurrent and maintenance dostarlimab +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu-positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas); and 3 targeted immunotherapy strategies (dostarlimab for mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas). Costs (2024 USD), utilities, and clinical estimates were derived from published literature and the National Cancer Database. The base case analysis was a microsimulation with 10,000 runs, accompanied by a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 20,000 trials. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We performed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses on key parameters and analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. All targeted immunotherapy strategies were cost-effective compared to chemotherapy alone in both NHB and NHW, while universal immunotherapy was never cost-effective. Targeted strategies were more cost-effective in NHB than NHW. Targeted dostarlimab for dMMR plus trastuzumab for HER2 serous and carcinosarcomas was the most cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy, with an ICER of $119,945/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, assuming longer durations of treatment benefit resulted in lower ICERs. Personalized treatment strategies incorporating HER2 and MMR testing should be considered to optimize both cost-effectiveness and equity in care.",3
Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment increases brown adipose tissue activity.,Chenodeoxycholic acid AND activity AND brown adipose tissue AND thermogenesis,"32655675,37916301,27488269","[PMID: 32655675] The gut microbiota plays a critical role in obesity and lipid metabolism disorder. Chokeberry (<i>Aronia melanocarpa</i> L<i>.</i>) are rich in polyphenols with various physiological and pharmacological activities. We determined serum physiological parameters and fecal microbial components by using related kits, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing every 10 days. Real-time PCR analysis was used to measure gene expression of bile acids (BAs) and lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissues. We analyzed the effects of different Chokeberry polyphenol (CBPs) treatment time on obesity and lipid metabolism in high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. The results indicated that CBPs treatment prevents obesity, liver steatosis and improves dyslipidemia in HFD-fed rats. CBPs modulated the composition of the gut microbiota with the extended treatment time, reducing the <i>Firmicutes</i>/<i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio (F/B ratio) and increasing the relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i> and other bacterial species associated with anti-obesity properties. We found that CBPs treatment gradually decreased the total BAs pool and particularly reduced the relative content of cholic acid (CA), deoxycholic acid (DCA) and enhanced the relative content of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). These changes were positively correlated <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotella</i> and negatively correlated with <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>Eubacterium</i>, <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>. In liver and white adipose tissues, the gene expression of lipogenesis, lipolysis and BAs metabolism were regulated after CBPs treatment in HFD-fed rats, which was most likely mediated through FXR and TGR-5 signaling pathway to improve lipid metabolism. In addition, the mRNA expression of PPARγ, UCP1 and PGC-1α were upregulated markedly in interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) after CBPs treatment. We confirmed that CBPs could reduce the body weight of HFD-fed rats by accelerating energy homeostasis and thermogenesis in iBAT. Finally, the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment results demonstrated that FMT from CBPs-treated rats failed to reduce the weight of HFD-fed rats. However, FMT from CBPs-treated rats improved dyslipidemia and reshaped gut microbiota in HFD-fed rats. In conclusion, CBPs treatment improved obesity and complications by regulating gut microbiota in HFD-fed rats. The gut microbiota plays an important role in BAs metabolism after CBPs treatment, and BAs have therefore emerged as major effectors in microbe-host signaling events that influence host lipid metabolism, energy metabolism and thermogenesis.

[PMID: 37916301] Individuals with rotating and night shift work are highly susceptible to developing metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. This is primarily attributed to disruptions in the circadian rhythms caused by activities and irregular eating habits. Time-restricted feeding (tRF) limits the daily eating schedules and has been demonstrated to markedly improve several metabolic disorders. Although an intricate relationship exists between tRF and circadian rhythms, the underlying specific mechanism remains elusive. We used a sleep disruption device for activity interference and established a model of circadian rhythm disorder in mice with different genetic backgrounds. We found that circadian rhythm disruption led to abnormal hormone secretion in the gut and elevated insulin resistance. tRF improved metabolic abnormalities caused by circadian rhythm disruption, primarily by restoring the gut hormone secretion rhythm and activating brown fat thermogenesis. The crucial function of brown fat in tRF was confirmed using a mouse model with brown fat removal. We demonstrated that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) effectively improved circadian rhythm disruption-induced metabolic disorders by restoring brown fat activation. Our findings demonstrate the potential benefits of CDCA in reversing metabolic disadvantages associated with irregular circadian rhythms.

[PMID: 27488269] Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, and associated pathologies, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular alterations, are increasingly escalating morbidity and mortality. Despite intensive study, no effective simple treatment for these conditions exists. As such, the need for go-to drugs is serious. Bile acids (BAs) present the possibility of reversing these problems, as various in vivo studies and clinical trials have shown significant effects with regard to weight and obesity reduction, insulin sensitivity restoration and cardiovascular improvements. However, the mechanism of action of BA-induced metabolic improvement has yet to be fully established. The currently most accepted model involves non-shivering thermogenesis for energy waste, but this is disputed. As such, we propose to determine whether the BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) can exert anti-obesogenic effects in vitro, independent of thermogenic brown adipose tissue activation. By exposing differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes to high glucose and CDCA, we demonstrate that this BA has anti-obesity effects in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of metabolic pathways clearly indicates an improvement in metabolic status, as these cells become more oxidative rather than glycolytic, which may be associated with an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Our work demonstrates that CDCA-induced metabolic alterations occur in white and brown adipocytes and are not totally dependent on endocrine/nervous system signaling, as thought until now. Furthermore, future exploration of the mechanisms behind these effects will undoubtedly reveal interesting targets for clinical modulation.",3
Chlamydia trachomatis is most prevalent in the UK among sexually-experienced individuals aged 16 to 24.,Chlamydia trachomatis AND sexually experienced individuals AND prevalence AND United Kingdom,"30981999,26290483,26082320","[PMID: 30981999] Mass drug administration (MDA) of 20 mg/kg (maximum 1 g in adults) azithromycin for ocular <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> (CT) infection is a key component of the WHO trachoma elimination strategy. However, this dose may be suboptimal in <i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> infection and may encourage emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to azithromycin. To determine the effect of MDA for trachoma elimination on <i>M. genitalium</i> prevalence, strain type and azithromycin resistance. A secondary analysis of CT-negative vulvovaginal swabs from three outpatient antenatal clinics (Honiara, Solomon Islands) from patients recruited either pre-MDA, or 10 months post-MDA in two cross-sectional surveys was carried out. Swabs were tested for <i>M. genitalium</i> infection using Fast Track Diagnostics Urethritis Plus nucleic acid amplification assay. <i>M. genitalium</i>-positive samples were subsequently tested for azithromycin resistance by sequencing domain V of the 23S rRNA DNA region of <i>M. genitalium</i> and underwent phylogenetic analysis by dual locus sequence typing. <i>M. genitalium</i> prevalence was 11.9% (28/236) in women pre-MDA and 10.9% (28/256) 10 months post-MDA (p=0.7467). Self-reported receipt of azithromycin as part of MDA was 49.2% in women recruited post-MDA and 17.9% (5/28) in those who tested <i>M. genitalium</i> positive. Of samples sequenced (21/28 pre-MDA, 22/28 post-MDA), all showed a macrolide susceptible genotype. Strain typing showed that sequence types diverged into two lineages, with a suggestion of strain replacement post-MDA. A single round of azithromycin MDA in an island population with high baseline <i>M. genitalium</i> prevalence did not appear to impact on either prevalence or azithromycin resistance, in contrast to reported decreased genital CT prevalence in the same population. This may be due to limitations such as sample size, including CT-negative samples only, and low MDA coverage. Further investigation of the impact of multiple rounds of MDA on <i>M. genitalium</i> azithromycin AMR in antibiotic experienced and naïve populations is warranted.

[PMID: 26290483] In the context of widespread opportunistic chlamydia screening among young adults, we aimed to quantify chlamydia testing and diagnosis among 16-24 year olds in Britain in relation to risk factors for prevalent chlamydia infection. Using data from sexually experienced (≥1 lifetime sexual partner) 16-year-old to 24-year-old participants in Britain's third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (conducted 2010-2012), we explored socio-demographic and behavioural factors associated with prevalent chlamydia infection (detected in urine; n=1832), self-reported testing and self-reported diagnosis in the last year (both n=3115). Chlamydia prevalence was 3.1% (95% CI 2.2% to 4.3%) in women and 2.3% (1.5% to 3.4%) in men. A total of 12.3% of women and 5.3% men had a previous chlamydia diagnosis. Factors associated with prevalent infection were also associated with testing and diagnosis (eg, increasing numbers of sexual partners), with some exceptions. For example, chlamydia prevalence was higher in women living in more deprived areas, whereas testing was not. In men, prevalence was higher in 20-24 than 16-19 year olds but testing was lower. Thirty per cent of women and 53.7% of men with ≥2 new sexual partners in the last year had not recently tested. In 2010-2012 in Britain, the proportion of young adults reporting chlamydia testing was generally higher in those reporting factors associated with chlamydia. However, many of those with risk factors had not been recently tested, leaving potential for undiagnosed infections. Greater screening and prevention efforts among individuals in deprived areas and those reporting risk factors for chlamydia may reduce undiagnosed prevalence and transmission.

[PMID: 26082320] To identify risk factors for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in female students. We performed a prospective study set in 11 universities and 9 further education colleges in London. In 2004-2006, 2529 sexually experienced, multiethnic, female students, mean age 20.8 years, provided self-taken vaginal samples and completed questionnaires at recruitment to the Prevention of Pelvic Infection chlamydia screening trial. After 12 months, they were followed up by questionnaire backed by medical record search and assessed for PID by blinded genitourinary medicine physicians. Of 2004 (79%) participants who reported numbers of sexual partners during follow-up, 32 (1.6%, 95% CI 1.1% to 2.2%) were diagnosed with PID. The strongest predictor of PID was baseline Chlamydia trachomatis (relative risk (RR) 5.7, 95% CI 2.6 to 15.6). After adjustment for baseline C. trachomatis, significant predictors of PID were ≥2 sexual partners or a new sexual partner during follow-up (RR 4.0, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.5; RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.3), age <20 years (RR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 7.0), recruitment from a further education college rather than a university (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.3) and history at baseline of vaginal discharge (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.8) or pelvic pain (RR 4.1, 95% CI 2.0 to 8.3) in the previous six months. Bacterial vaginosis and Mycoplasma genitalium infection were no longer significantly associated with PID after adjustment for baseline C. trachomatis. Multiple or new partners in the last 12 months, age <20 years and attending a further education college rather than a university were risk factors for PID after adjustment for baseline C. trachomatis infection. Sexual health education and screening programmes could be targeted at these high-risk groups. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00115388).",3

This review synthesizes current understanding of progesterone-mediated immune regulation during early bovine pregnancy, focusing on its molecular mechanisms. These include genomic pathways involving nuclear progesterone receptors, non-genomic signaling through membrane progesterone receptors and progesterone receptor membrane component 1, and immunoregulatory effects mediated by the progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF). Progesterone acts both locally at the maternal-fetal interface and systemically, shaping immune tolerance and protecting the developing conceptus. Locally, it promotes an anti-inflammatory microenvironment by expanding regulatory T cells, reducing the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, and suppressing dendritic cell activation. It downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, while upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-4 and interleukin-10. Additionally, progesterone inhibits the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway, thereby attenuating inflammatory responses. PIBF contributes by enhancing T helper 2 cytokine profiles and reducing cytotoxic activity. Emerging evidence also suggests that progesterone modulates immune function in peripheral organs, including the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, indicating systemic immunoregulation. However, species-specific differences in receptor expression, signaling cascades, and immune cell responsiveness remain poorly understood. Addressing these gaps is essential for optimizing reproductive management in cattle. In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of progesterone's immunological roles may lead to improved fertility outcomes and advance knowledge of maternal-fetal immune tolerance in ruminants.

[PMID: 41186005] Aeromonas hydrophila-induced bacterial sepsis is a major threat to aquaculture, characterised by excessive inflammation, ferroptosis (an iron-dependent lipid peroxidation-driven cell death) and oxidative damage, which collectively lead to high mortality. Taurine (TAU) and glutathione (GSH) have been demonstrated to have potential therapeutic efficacy against ferroptosis-associated pathologies through redox modulation. However, their combined effects and underlying mechanisms in alleviating A. hydrophila infection remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the protective roles of TAU, GSH and their combination in vitro using yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) macrophages and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) kidney (CIK) cells and in vivo using yellow catfish challenged with A. hydrophila. The results showed that TAU and GSH, either alone or in combination, alleviated oxidative stress by significantly reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and inhibited nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway activation. This led to downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β), accompanied by alleviated ferroptosis. In vivo, dietary supplementation with TAU (10 g/kg) or GSH (350 mg/kg) alone improved survival rates (51.7% and 38.3%, respectively), reduced tissue bacterial loads and protected intestinal and hepatic tissues by preserving mucosal barrier function. However, the TAU + GSH combination unexpectedly decreased survival (28.3%) due to excessive immunosuppression (overproduction of IL-10 and TGF-β) and impaired mucosal barrier, which exacerbated pathogen colonisation. Together, our findings demonstrate that TAU and GSH alleviate A. hydrophila-induced oxidative stress by reducing mitochondrial ROS overproduction and disrupting the ROS/NF-κB signalling pathway, thereby attenuating inflammatory cytokine storms and ferroptosis. These results provide novel insights into the pathological mechanisms of bacterial sepsis in fish and develop sustainable strategies to improve disease resistance in aquaculture.

[PMID: 41185743] Many meta-analyses and systematic reviews have explored the impact of omega-3 supplementation on clinical outcomes in individuals with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Thus, this study aimed to capture the effects of omega-3 supplementation on GI cancers and associated complications. This umbrella study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive advanced search was executed across Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science until 25 January 2025. Data were pooled by using random-effects models based on heterogeneity. The entire statistical analysis was performed via RStudio and R. The statistical analysis results are presented as the mean difference (MD), standard mean difference (SMD), and relative risk (RR) in conjunction with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Eight meta-analysis papers were included in our umbrella review. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation improved the serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (SMD: -0.34; 95% CI: -0.56, -0.11), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (SMD: -0.30; 95% CI: -0.49, -0.12; MD: -4.96; 95% CI: -6.62, -3.30), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: -5.46; 95% CI: -10.06, -0.87). Omega-3 supplementation improved the CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> ratio (SMD: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.71) and reduced the length of hospitalization (MD: -2.45 d; 95% CI: -3.11, -1.80). Omega-3 supplementation was associated with a 24% significant reduction in the risk of overall complications (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.86). Omega-3 supplementation may reduce the risk of overall complications and length of hospitalization in individuals suffering from GI cancers. Additionally, supplementation with omega-3 may alleviate the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, and acute-phase proteins such as CRP.",3
Citrullinated proteins externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps act indirectly to perpetuate the inflammatory cycle via induction of autoantibodies.,citrullinated proteins AND neutrophil extracellular traps AND inflammatory cycle AND autoantibodies,41186650,"[PMID: 41186650] Patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are at increased risk for infections. Identifying clinical and immunological biomarkers predictive of infection is essential. We included 169 patients from the MYOTReCSZ cohort, all with ≥ 6 months of follow-up. Clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected, including: (1) low-density granulocytes and monocyte subsets, (2) serum cytokines, and (3) neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) quantification. The primary outcome was infection development. Most patients were female (72.78%), with a median age of 42. At least one infection occurred in 46.7% of patients; 55.6% were severe and 32.9% had recurrent infections. Independent predictors of infection included number of immunosuppressants (OR 1.7, P = 0.023), gastrointestinal activity score, cardiovascular damage-VAS, anti-Jo1 positivity (OR 10.0, P = 0.05), heliotrope rash, alopecia, and mycophenolate mofetil use (OR 11.9, P = 0.026). Severe infections were associated with number of immunosuppressants, low albumin, constitutional activity score, gastrointestinal damage-VAS, and TLR4⁺ intermediate monocytes (OR 1.0, P = 0.038). Recurrent infections correlated with lower TLR2⁺ classical monocytes (OR 0.4, P = 0.045), cumulative prednisone dose, global damage-VAS (OR 2.0, P = 0.0004), and anti-PM/Scl75 positivity (OR 3.8, P = 0.006). In conclusion, IIM patients with higher baseline activity and damage scores, specific autoantibodies, and altered innate immune cell phenotypes are more likely to develop infections. These parameters may serve as early biomarkers to stratify infection risk in clinical practice.",1
Combination nicotine replacement therapies with varenicline or bupropion are more effective after 12 weeks of reatment compared to varenicline monotherapy.,Combination nicotine replacement therapy AND Varenicline AND Bupropion AND Smoking cessation,"39556472,39231467,39659160","[PMID: 39556472] The number one cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States is tobacco use. According to data from the National Health Interview Survey, 18.7% of US adults (46 million people) currently use a tobacco product. Smoking causes lung, laryngeal, hepatocellular, and colorectal cancers and possibly breast cancer. Nicotine is the highly addictive component of tobacco that releases dopamine when it binds to alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. This produces reward sensations that become associated with specific behaviors and relieves stress and negative emotions. Public policy changes, behavioral interventions, and pharmacologic approaches have been shown to reduce tobacco use. Combining behavior therapy with pharmacotherapy increases cessation rates. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved five nicotine replacement therapies and two no-nicotine oral medications to assist with smoking cessation. Medications are categorized as controllers or relievers based on their pharmacokinetics. Nicotine replacement therapy delivers lower amounts of nicotine and needs to be titrated to alleviate patient cravings. Varenicline is a selective partial agonist at the alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and is recommended over bupropion for smoking cessation.

[PMID: 39231467] To summarise systematic reviews on tobacco addiction published by the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (CTAG) from 2021 to 2023. We identified all new and updated Cochrane Reviews published by CTAG between 2021 and 2023. We present key results from these reviews and discuss promising avenues for future research. CTAG published five new reviews and one overview of reviews, and updated eight reviews. Review evidence showed that all main pharmacotherapies (varenicline, cytisine, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], especially when patches are combined with fast acting forms like gum) are effective for smoking cessation, as are nicotine e-cigarettes. Evidence suggested similar magnitude of effects of varenicline, cytisine, and nicotine e-cigarettes; these emerged as the most effective treatments. Evidence also supported behavioural counselling and financial incentives for smoking cessation. Secondary analyses of the Cochrane review of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation showed over half of participants assigned to e-cigarette conditions were still using them at six months or longer, that biomarkers of potential harm significantly reduced in people switching from smoking to vaping or to dual use, and that there was insufficient evidence to draw associations between e-liquid flavours and smoking cessation. Findings on mindfulness-based interventions, interventions delivered by dental and primary care professionals, interventions to prevent weight gain after smoking cessation, and interventions for waterpipe cessation were less certain. Reviews of observational evidence showed that smoking cessation reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in people living with cardiovascular disease, and improved mental health. Nicotine replacement therapy (especially patches combined with fast acting forms), varenicline, cytisine, bupropion, nicotine e-cigarettes, behavioural counselling, and financial incentives are all effective ways to help people quit smoking. Quitting smoking improves mental health and reduces cardiovascular events and mortality in people living with cardiovascular disease.

[PMID: 39659160] The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the leading smoking cessation medications among individuals with current versus past major depressive disorder (MDD). This was a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind trial over 12 weeks with varenicline or bupropion, followed by a 12-week assessment, in participants ages 18-75 with past (N=2,174) or current (N=451) MDD or without psychiatric disorders (N=4,028). Interventions included 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy with placebo, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; nicotine patch), bupropion, or varenicline, and brief counseling. The primary safety outcome was occurrence of one or more moderate to severe neuropsychiatric adverse events. Efficacy was assessed as biochemically verified continuous abstinence during weeks 9-12. Among all 6,653 participants, the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events did not differ by medication within the past-MDD, current-MDD, or nonpsychiatric cohorts. The MDD cohorts had higher risk difference (p<0.001) for neuropsychiatric adverse events compared with the nonpsychiatric cohort (past-MDD cohort, risk difference=-0.03, 95% CI=-0.05, -0.02; current-MDD cohort, risk difference=-0.02, 95% CI=-0.05, 0.00). Within the past-MDD cohort, the odds ratios compared with placebo were 3.0 (95% CI=2.0, 4.5) for varenicline, 2.1 (95% CI=1.6, 2.7) for bupropion, and 2.1 (95% CI=1.4, 3.2) for NRT. Within the current-MDD cohort, varenicline differed from placebo (odds ratio=2.67, 95% CI=1.2, 6.15) and NRT (odds ratio=2.93, 95% CI=1.2, 7.2). All medications were generally safe in both MDD cohorts. NRT and bupropion were not more effective than placebo for those with current MDD. Varenicline plus counseling may be the best treatment for individuals with past or current MDD, given its greater efficacy, similar risk of adverse events, and, for those with current depression, reductions in anxiety and depression while trying to quit smoking.",3

Advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) was induced in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats using thioacetamide (TAA, 250 mg/kg; 12 weeks) or bile duct ligation (BDL; 28 days). Healthy rats served as controls (n = 11-18/group). We assessed in vivo hepatic and systemic hemodynamic parameters, hepatic microvascular function, and hepatic transcriptomic analyses, including sex-specific differences in cellular composition using gene deconvolution (n = 5/group). Two human sample cohorts were compared to preclinical data for translational insights. Both animal models showed PH. TAA males had similar portal pressure (PP) to females (14.2 vs 14.1 mmHg), but BDL males had significantly higher PP than females (14.5 vs 12.5 mmHg; p = 0.003). No differences were observed in hepatic microvascular function. In the BDL model, females had more fenestrae and porosity, and less fibrosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TAA males had dysregulated metabolic pathways, while females had deregulated genes in hormone signaling. In the BDL model, males showed higher deregulation in platelet activation, protein degradation, vesicular transport, and disease-related pathways. Gene deconvolution showed males had a more specialized endothelial phenotype basally, with more changes in endothelial and macrophage phenotypes after injury. In MASLD patients, men had dysregulated metabolic pathways, while women showed deregulation in fibrosis, extracellular matrix, and endocrine regulation. In HBV patients, men had more dysregulation in fibrosis, inflammation, and immune response. Female MASLD patients had more activated hepatic stellate cells, and greater loss of endothelial phenotype compared to men. This study highlights sex-dependent molecular differences in the pathophysiology of cirrhosis in two preclinical models. Further research in preclinical and human liver disease is essential to develop safe and effective treatments for ACLD in both sexes.

[PMID: 38233918] Compared with corn, wheat contains higher crude protein, amino acids concentration. However, wheat contains a mass of anti-nutritional factors, resulting in increased of the digesta viscosity and impaired the intestinal function in ruminant. This study aimed to investigate the effects of substitution of different amounts of wheat for corn on hepatic metabolism in the Tibetan lamb. Ninety Tibetan lambs (Body weight = 12.37 ± 0.92 kg) were randomly assigned to three groups: 0% wheat diet (Control), 10% wheat diet (Low group), and 15% wheat diet (High group). The feeding trial lasted for 130 d, including a 10 d adaption period. Hepatic gene expression profiling was performed via RNA sequencing after the conclusion of the feeding trials. Results showed that greater level of glutathione peroxidase levels in L group compared with those of the C and H groups (P < 0.05). The immune indexes, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and IgM were also elevated in L group compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). Compared with H group, the hepatocytes were arranged radially, and hepatic plates anastomosed with each other to form a labyrinth-like structure in L group. Transcriptomic analysis showed 872 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between H and L group, of which 755 were down-regulated and 117 were up-regulated. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, 32 pathways were significantly enriched (Q-value < 0.05), such as the cAMP signaling pathway, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, leukocyte transendothelial migration, platelet activation and adipocytokine signaling pathway. Additionally, the expression of comment DEGs were verified via quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. In summary, our findings suggest that wheat can be supplemented up to 10% in Tibetan sheep, contributing to improve the hepatic oxidative stress, immune response and lipid metabolism through regulating the expression of related genes.",3

Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.

[PMID: 41185093] Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the apoE4 isoform (C112R) represents the strongest genetic risk factor. We combined binding-site mapping and discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations to elucidate isoform-specific apoE-Aβ interactions. Computational peptide-array analysis identified Aβ-binding hotspots in the apoE4 N-terminal domain (NTD) around R112, conferring greater Aβ-binding propensity than apoE3. DMD simulations showed that apoE4 NTD is less stable and more solvent-exposed, resulting in stronger Aβ binding, especially near the mutation site. Upon binding apoE NTDs, Aβ exhibited an increased β-sheet content, suggesting a lowered fibril nucleation barrier. Incorporating these insights into a recently established thermodynamic-kinetic framework of amyloid aggregation rationalizes apoE's biphasic effect on Aβ aggregation: apoE retards Aβ fibrillization at low Aβ-concentrations via monomer sequestration but accelerates the process at high concentrations by facilitating nucleation. Our findings offer mechanistic insight into the APOE genotype-dependent modulation of Aβ aggregation and may inform genotype-specific therapeutic strategies for AD.

[PMID: 41185939] Despite the tremendous potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology in precision therapeutics, intracellular delivery remains a major challenge. High cytoplasmic viscosity and lysosomal entrapment significantly impair the cytosolic transport and gene-editing efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate that both the size and magnetic responsiveness of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters can be finely tuned by modulating ionic strength, enabling their rapid propulsion under external magnetic fields. Leveraging this property, we develop magnetic nanoparticle cluster nanorobots (MagCbots) of approximately 200 nm in size by electrostatically assembling Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids. Under magnetic actuation, MagCbots exhibit rapid rotation in highly viscous intracellular environments, achieving a linear velocity of ∼0.41 μm/s. MagCbots reduce intracellular viscosity by approximately 50% and enhance lysosomal escape efficiency by 3-fold compared to nonactuated counterparts. Their porous architecture not only offers high payload capacity but also protects plasmid DNA from enzymatic degradation. Notably, MagCbots enable efficient genome editing of both PD1 and PLK1 genes across various cell lines including hard-to-transfect Jurkat T cells. This magnetically driven nanorobot platform presents a promising strategy for active intracellular delivery and holds significant potential for advancing gene therapy and related biomedical applications.",3

[PMID: 41184301] Cyclin A2 (CCNA2), a master cell cycle regulator silenced in postnatal cardiomyocytes, promotes cardiac repair in animal models. However, its effect on cytokinesis in adult human cardiomyocytes was previously unknown. We engineered a replication-deficient adenoviral vector encoding human CCNA2 under the cardiac Troponin T promoter and delivered it to freshly isolated cardiomyocytes from adult human hearts. Time-lapse live imaging revealed the induction of complete cytokinesis with preservation of sarcomeres and calcium mobilization in redifferentiated daughter cardiomyocytes. Single-nucleus transcriptomic profiling of CCNA2-transgenic and non-transgenic mouse hearts uncovered a cardiomyocyte subpopulation characterized by enrichment of cytokinesis, proliferation, and reprogramming gene signatures. Ultra-deep bulk RNA sequencing of adult and fetal human hearts further highlighted reprogramming pathways relevant to CCNA2-induced effects. Together, these findings demonstrate that CCNA2 can reinitiate cytokinesis in adult human cardiomyocytes, illuminating conserved molecular programs that support its promise as a regenerative gene therapy for the heart.

DUSP4 increases apoptosis.,DUSP4 AND apoptosis AND regulation of apoptosis AND DUSP4 function,"33760201,34254709,34299042","[PMID: 33760201] MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play an important role in regulating the occurrence and development of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). miR‑122‑5p is widely considered a tumour inhibitor, which has not been fully explored in PTC. Bioinformatics analysis identified dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), a tumour promoter gene for PTC, as a downstream target of miR‑122‑5p. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of miR‑122‑5p in PTC oncogenesis. In this study, the expression pattern of miR‑122‑5p in PTC cancer tissues and PTC cell lines was investigated via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the roles of miR‑122‑5p in PTC were explored using gain‑of‑function and loss‑of‑function assays. The results revealed that the expression of miR‑122‑5p was significantly lower in PTC cancer tissues, especially in cancer tissues with significant invasion or metastasis. Overexpression of miR‑122‑5p caused by miR‑122‑5p mimics inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of the PTC cell line K1, while knockdown of miR‑122‑5p by miR‑122‑5p inhibitors exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> assays revealed that miR‑122‑5p overexpression inhibited tumour growth. In addition, miR‑122‑5p was negatively correlated with DUSP4 expression in PTC cancer tissues. miR‑122‑5p overexpression inhibited DUSP4 expression in K1 cells, while miR‑122‑5p downregulation produced the inverse effect. Specifically, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding sites of miR‑122‑5p on the 3'‑UTR of DUSP4, demonstrating the targeting effect of miR‑122‑5p on DUSP4. miR‑122‑5p inhibited the oncogenesis of PTC by targeting DUSP4, revealing the potential application value of miR‑122‑5p in the diagnosis and treatment of PTC.

[PMID: 34254709] Dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), a member of the dual specificity phosphatase family, is responsible for the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ERK, JNK and p38, which are mitogen-activated protein kinases involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, but also in inflammation processes. Given its importance for cellular signalling, DUSP4 is subjected to a tight regulation and there is growing evidence that its expression is dysregulated in several tumours. However, the mechanisms underlying DUSP4 transcriptional regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we analysed the regulation of the human DUSP4 promoters 1 and 2, located upstream of exons 1 and 2, respectively, by the cancer-related transcription factors (TFs) STAT3, FOXA1, CTCF and YY1. The presence of binding sites for these TFs was predicted in both promoters through the in silico analysis of DUSP4, and their functionality was assessed through luciferase activity assays. Regulatory activity of the TFs tested was found to be promoter-specific. While CTCF stimulated the activity of promoter 2 that controls the transcription of variants 2 and X1, STAT3 stimulated the activity of promoter 1 that controls the transcription of variant 1. YY1 positively regulated both promoters, although to different extents. Through site-directed mutagenesis, the functionality of YY1 binding sites present in promoter 2 was confirmed. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulation of DUSP4, contributing to a better comprehension of the mechanisms of its dysregulation observed in several types of cancer.

[PMID: 34299042] Diarylpentanoid (DAP), an analog that was structurally modified from a naturally occurring curcumin, has shown to enhance anticancer efficacy compared to its parent compound in various cancers. This study aims to determine the cytotoxicity, antiproliferative, and apoptotic activity of diarylpentanoid MS13 on two subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells: squamous cell carcinoma (NCI-H520) and adenocarcinoma (NCI-H23). Gene expression analysis was performed using Nanostring PanCancer Pathways Panel to determine significant signaling pathways and targeted genes in these treated cells. Cytotoxicity screening revealed that MS13 exhibited greater inhibitory effect in NCI-H520 and NCI-H23 cells compared to curcumin. MS13 induced anti-proliferative activity in both cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Morphological analysis revealed that a significant number of MS13-treated cells exhibited apoptosis. A significant increase in caspase-3 activity and decrease in Bcl-2 protein concentration was noted in both MS13-treated cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A total of 77 and 47 differential expressed genes (DEGs) were regulated in MS13 treated-NCI-H520 and NCI-H23 cells, respectively. Among the DEGs, 22 were mutually expressed in both NCI-H520 and NCI-H23 cells in response to MS13 treatment. The top DEGs modulated by MS13 in NCI-H520-DUSP4, CDKN1A, GADD45G, NGFR, and EPHA2-and NCI-H23 cells-HGF, MET, COL5A2, MCM7, and GNG4-were highly associated with PI3K, cell cycle-apoptosis, and MAPK signaling pathways. In conclusion, MS13 may induce antiproliferation and apoptosis activity in squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of NSCLC cells by modulating DEGs associated with PI3K-AKT, cell cycle-apoptosis, and MAPK pathways. Therefore, our present findings could provide an insight into the anticancer activity of MS13 and merits further investigation as a potential anticancer agent for NSCLC cancer therapy.",3

Here we show that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in depletion of T helper type 17 (TH17) cells in the ileal mucosa of rhesus macaques, thereby impairing mucosal barrier functions to S. typhimurium dissemination. In SIV-negative macaques, the gene expression profile induced by S. typhimurium in ligated ileal loops was dominated by TH17 responses, including the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-22. TH17 cells were markedly depleted in SIV-infected rhesus macaques, resulting in blunted TH17 responses to S. typhimurium infection and increased bacterial dissemination. IL-17 receptor-deficient mice showed increased systemic dissemination of S. typhimurium from the gut, suggesting that IL-17 deficiency causes defects in mucosal barrier function. We conclude that SIV infection impairs the IL-17 axis, an arm of the mucosal immune response preventing systemic microbial dissemination from the gastrointestinal tract.

[PMID: 20543591] We discuss studies on a subset of CD4T cells, designated Th17, and their role in the pathogenesis of human and simian acquired immune deficiency, caused by infection with HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), respectively. Most of the Th17 cells are lost within 2 weeks from infection at mucosal sites of SIV-infected macaques and are not replenished over time. Comparison of simian pathogenic and nonpathogenic models of SIV infection suggests that Th17 cells contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS. Th17 cells, a recently identified subset of T helper cells, play a major role in both inducing autoimmune disorders and fencing off extracellular pathogens. Several groups have reported that the number of Th17 cells is decreased in the gut of HIV-infected and SIV-infected hosts. The loss of Th17 cells from the mucosal compartment has been associated with the dissemination of Salmonella typhimurium that is normally contained locally by the host immune system. It is believed that microbial translocation sustains immune activation in HIV infection and contributes to AIDS. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to disruption of mucosal integrity, viral spread, and chronic immune activation is of crucial importance for the design of efficient vaccines and therapeutic intervention for HIV.",2

Intravenous infusion of all drugs was started at the beginning of the operation and continued for 60 minutes. At the end of infusion period the depth of fluorescein dye penetration in the skin flap was assessed visually from photographic records, and the flap survival area was measured by the grid method at the seventh postoperative day. There was a significant reduction in distal necrosis of random skin flaps after intravenous infusion of L-arginine, iloprost, and L-arginine combined with iloprost (p < 0.01). Possible mechanisms that may be responsible for impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and vasospasm in the microvasculature of random skin flap and their prevention with L-arginine and iloprost include restoration of the depleted stores of NO which in turn causes vasodilatation and has an antithrombotic effect.

[PMID: 2153470] The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms associated with the reciprocal relation between magnesium and calcium on vascular smooth muscle tone in bovine pulmonary artery and vein. Rapid removal of magnesium from Krebs-bicarbonate medium used to bathe isolated rings of precontracted artery or vein caused transient endothelium- and calcium-dependent relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation. Both responses were antagonized by oxyhemoglobin, methylene blue, or superoxide anion and were enhanced by superoxide dismutase. The transient relaxation was followed by sustained endothelium-independent contraction. Endothelium-denuded vascular rings contracted in response to extracellular magnesium depletion without alteration in cyclic GMP levels. The data suggest that vascular endothelium-derived nitric oxide is responsible for the calcium-dependent relaxation elicited by extracellular magnesium depletion. Indeed, in bioassay cascade studies, magnesium removal from the medium used to perfuse intact artery or vein enhanced the formation and/or release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor by calcium-dependent mechanisms. In the absence of both extracellular magnesium and calcium, calcium readdition caused transient endothelium-dependent relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation, and both responses were abolished by oxyhemoglobin or methylene blue. In the presence of magnesium, however, readdition of calcium to calcium-depleted medium caused only contractile responses. Addition of magnesium to calcium-containing medium consistently caused endothelium- and cyclic GMP-independent relaxation that was not altered by oxyhemoglobin or methylene blue. Thus, magnesium and calcium elicit reciprocal or mutually antagonistic effects at the levels of both endothelium-derived relaxing factor formation and/or release and smooth muscle contraction. This relation may be of physiological importance, and the possibility that a reduction in circulating magnesium levels could lead to calcium-mediated vasospasm may be of pathophysiological concern.",2

Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41187216] Many taxa have independently evolved genetic sex determination where a single gene located on a sex chromosome controls gonadal differentiation. The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex-reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the ""Four Core Genotypes"" model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.

[PMID: 41187208] This study reports the first green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using an aqueous leaf extract of Brownlowia tersa (B. tersa), confirming their formation via UV-Vis spectrophotometry with a peak at 472 nm. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial and neuroprotective activities, particularly for Alzheimer's disease. GC-MS and FT-IR analyses identified phenolics and flavonoids as the capping and reducing agents in the synthesis process. FESEM imaging showed nanoparticles of varied shapes and sizes, while EDX analysis confirmed the presence of silver, oxygen, and carbon. The antimicrobial activity was demonstrated with inhibition zones ranging from 8.5 to 10.5 mm against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 100 and 200 μg/disc, compared to control, deionised water. In antioxidant assays, AgNPs exhibited an IC₅₀ of 1533.448 μg/ml, significantly higher than L-ascorbic acid (IC₅₀: 83.948 μg/ml) and the plant extract (IC₅₀: 254.438 μg/ml), indicating weaker antioxidant properties of AgNPs. The cytotoxicity of the AgNPs was assessed using the brine shrimp lethality test, yielding LC₅₀ value of 13.50 μg/ml, indicating moderate toxicity. Neuropharmacological tests, except the elevated plus maze, on swiss albino mice revealed significant anxiolytic effects (p < 0.05) and enhanced locomotor activity. Molecular docking studies of bioactive compounds from B. tersa leaves with Alzheimer's and bacterial infection-related proteins revealed binding energies from -7.7 to -5.2 kcal/mol, with Benzamide, N-ethyl-N-[(4-ethylaminophenyl) sulfonyl]- and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol showing the strongest affinities. While the results are promising, the study acknowledges challenges in scaling up the synthesis process and emphasises the need for further research into the long-term biological effects and safety of AgNPs. Overall, B. tersa-derived AgNPs show great potential for therapeutic applications in bacterial infections and neurological disorders, but scalability and safety require more investigation.",3

Approximately 1 hour later, Floseal hemostatic matrix was applied to a briskly bleeding screw hole in the L3 vertebral body, and the patient experienced an abrupt onset of hypotension and ventilatory difficulty. Epinephrine, dexamethasone, and blood products were administered for hemodynamic support while the surgical site was closed. Removal of the drapes revealed a widespread erythematous rash, and the patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit. When stable 3 days later, he returned to the operating room for completion of the spinal fusion. Postoperative laboratory assays were sent that revealed elevated levels of tryptase, total IgE, porcine, and bovine gelatin-specific IgE. The patient was counseled to avoid gelatin-containing products. At 6-month follow-up, his instrumented spine was radiographically fused and he reported no further allergic issues. Anaphylaxis may occur because of animal gelatin components of topical hemostatic agents. Previous reports have focused on the thrombin components. Care should be taken in the administration of these products, particularly in the atopic individual.

[PMID: 17338651] Multiple myeloma, as with other malignancies, has been associated with the development of venous thromboembolic events. Chemotherapy or steroids in combination with antiangiogenic agents can further enhance this risk. The identification of measurable factors associated with this prothrombotic state could help in the selection of patients who need antithrombotic prophylaxis. Malignancy-associated thrombophilic state, paraprotein-specific mechanisms and treatment-induced changes can explain the high rate of thrombosis in this cancer population. While the release of inflammatory cytokines induces high levels of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor and downregulate the protein C system, elevated plasma immunoglobulin can impair fibrinolysis. Strategies of thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, warfarin or aspirin in patients treated with thalidomide/chemotherapy or lenalidomide and dexamethasone have shown efficacy. Early data indicate that the effect of low molecular weight heparin on multiple myeloma is not confined to the anticoagulant effect but could extend to survival; a similar positive trend in overall survival has also been reported in patients treated with aspirin.

Differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells is skewed when insulin signaling is suppressed.,Insulin signaling AND Progenitor cell differentiation AND Myeloid cell AND Suppression effects,"41078332,41078332,30013477","[PMID: 41078332] Recent advancements in therapeutics have extended lifespan and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients, particularly with severe phenotypes. However, most patients fail to achieve normal motor function. Although structural bone defects and increased fracture susceptibility have been reported in both SMA patients and mouse models, the role of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein in bone homeostasis and therapeutic targets remains incompletely understood. To investigate the function of SMN in bone metabolism, a mild SMA mouse model and Smn1 conditional knockout mice in the myeloid lineage and mature osteoclasts were utilized. Bone architecture was assessed using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histological staining, and immunohistochemistry. RNA sequencing was performed to explore molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal defects. Primary bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were differentiated into osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively, and co-cultured to evaluate SMN-dependent regulation of osteoblast-osteoclast interactions. The therapeutic potential of exogenous osteoprotegerin (OPG) administration was further assessed. SMA mice exhibited significant bone mass reduction, characterized by impaired osteogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis.

Co-culture studies demonstrated that osteoclast hyperactivity in SMA mice resulted from decreased osteoblast-derived OPG, induced by local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) deficiency. Mechanistically, SMN depletion led to IGF1 downregulation, thereby suppressing PI3K-Akt signaling, reducing OPG expression, and ultimately disrupting osteoblast-osteoclast coupling. Administration of exogenous OPG effectively mitigated osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity, indirectly promoting osteoblast function and partially restoring bone formation. These findings reveal that SMN protein loss caused IGF1 deficiency that inhibited the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, leading to downregulation of OPG expression and disrupted osteoblast-osteoclast coupling. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting OPG in SMA to alleviate skeletal complications and improve patient outcomes.

[PMID: 41078332] Recent advancements in therapeutics have extended lifespan and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients, particularly with severe phenotypes. However, most patients fail to achieve normal motor function. Although structural bone defects and increased fracture susceptibility have been reported in both SMA patients and mouse models, the role of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein in bone homeostasis and therapeutic targets remains incompletely understood. To investigate the function of SMN in bone metabolism, a mild SMA mouse model and Smn1 conditional knockout mice in the myeloid lineage and mature osteoclasts were utilized. Bone architecture was assessed using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histological staining, and immunohistochemistry. RNA sequencing was performed to explore molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal defects. Primary bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were differentiated into osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively, and co-cultured to evaluate SMN-dependent regulation of osteoblast-osteoclast interactions. The therapeutic potential of exogenous osteoprotegerin (OPG) administration was further assessed. SMA mice exhibited significant bone mass reduction, characterized by impaired osteogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis. However, in vitro experiments revealed suppressed osteoclast differentiation in BMMs from SMA mice, which was inconsistent with in vivo findings. Co-culture studies demonstrated that osteoclast hyperactivity in SMA mice resulted from decreased osteoblast-derived OPG, induced by local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) deficiency.

[PMID: 30013477] Acute myeloid leukemia is an aggressive disease characterized by clonal proliferation and differentiation into immature hematopoietic cells of dysfunctional myeloid precursors. Accumulating evidence shows that CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup> leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for drug resistance, metastasis, and relapse of leukemia. In this study, we found that Nanog, a transcription factor in stem cells, is significantly overexpressed in CD34<sup>+</sup> populations from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and in LSCs from leukemia cell lines. Our data demonstrate that the knockdown of Nanog inhibited proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Moreover, Nanog silencing suppressed the leukemogenesis of LSCs in mice. In addition, we found that these functions of Nanog were regulated by the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway. Nanog overexpression rescued the colony formation ability of LSCs treated with picropodophyllin (PPP), an IGF1R inhibitor. By contrast, knockdown of Nanog abolished the effects of IGF2 on the colony formation ability of these LSCs. These findings suggest that the IGF2/IGF1R/Nanog signaling pathway plays a critical role in LSC proliferation.",3

However, the precise regulatory mechanisms controlling LAP remain poorly understood. Here, we identify enkurin domain-containing protein 1 (ENKD1) as a key negative regulator of LAP during infection with these pathogens. Macrophages infected with <i><i>L.</i> monocytogenes</i> (10403S), <i>S. typhimurium</i> (ATCC14028), or <i>F. novicida</i> (U112) exhibit significant ENKD1 downregulation. ENKD1-deficient macrophages display enhanced antibacterial activity, characterized by increased LAP, higher reactive oxygen species production, enhanced LC3 lipidation on phagosomes, and improved phagosome-lysosome fusion. In vivo, ENKD1<i>-</i>deficient mice <i>ex</i>hibited improved bacterial clearance in the liver and spleen, with notable survival benefits. Mechanistically, ENKD1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), which mediates degradation of Run domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein (RUBCN) through K48-linked polyubiquitination, thereby dampening RUBCN's role in LAP. Our findings reveal an ENKD1-TRIM21-RUBCN axis that suppresses LAP, providing insights into antibacterial immune regulation and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to enhance host defense against intracellular pathogens.

[PMID: 41187066] Mice often serve as valuable surrogate models for studying human reproduction. This study provides a single-cell transcriptomic profile of mouse immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout pregnancy and assesses the similarities and differences between these immune cells and human decidual immune cells. Homeostasis of the immune microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface is essential for pregnancy. Immune cell heterogeneity at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnant mice remains understudied. Here, we perform in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analysis with 120,238 maternal-fetal single cells of mice from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E18.5 and in vitro experiments to establish an immune cell atlas. Macrophages constitute the largest population, with some subsets resembling human counterparts, and the number of Ccr2 + macrophages in the decidua increases as pregnancy progresses. Neutrophils constitute the second largest population, and Ifit1 + N2 neutrophils are localized close to the implantation site during early pregnancy. Three NK cell subsets were identified, including the previously reported NK1.1 - subset. In combination with in vitro experiments, the presence of T and B cells within the decidua was validated. Our work profiles a comprehensive immune cell atlas of the mouse maternal-fetal interface, offering a valuable reference for further investigations.

[PMID: 41186894] Antimicrobial peptides (APs) are increasingly used in livestock production because of their effective antibacterial properties and low risk of causing drug resistance. However, their effects on intestinal barrier function in ruminants remain relatively unexplored. This study explored the effect of composite APs on colonic microbiota and barrier integrity in Holstein steers. Twelve steers were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 6): a control (CK) group that received a basal diet and an AP group that received the same diet supplemented with 8 g/ (d· head) of APs over a 270-day feeding period. After humanely killing, colonic tissue and contents were collected for analysis using histology, 16S rRNA sequencing, and metabolomics. The AP group demonstrated significantly increased mucosal thickness and mucin secretion (p < 0.05), enhanced activities of β-glucosidase, lipase, xylanase, cellulase, and pectinase (p < 0.01), elevated acetate, propionate, and butyrate levels (p < 0.05), upregulated polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) expression at both gene and protein levels (p < 0.05), reduced α-amylase activity (p < 0.01), and decreased density and abundance of immunoglobulin (Ig)A<sup>+</sup>, IgG<sup>+</sup> and IgM<sup>+</sup> cell clusters (p < 0.05). Additionally, AP supplementation induced functional reorganization of the intestinal microbiota. Microbial analysis indicated increased growth of beneficial bacteria, particularly Firmicutes and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, but a selective decrease in potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Metabolomic analysis suggested elevated lithocholic acid levels and modified lipid metabolism in the AP group. Correlation analysis demonstrated that alterations in colonic microbiota and metabolites were associated with enhanced intestinal barrier function. Hence, AP supplementation promotes intestinal health in Holstein steers by modulating epithelial development and microbial community composition.",3

An improved understanding of the genetic basis of FFA will support the identification of pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. To identify novel genomic loci at which common genetic variation affects FFA susceptibility and assess nonadditive effects on genetic risk between susceptibility loci. Four genome-wide association studies were combined using an SE-weighted meta-analysis. Within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, stepwise conditional analysis was undertaken to determine independently associated classical MHC class I alleles. Statistical tests for epistatic interaction were performed between risk alleles at the MHC and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) loci. Genome-wide significant locus associated with FFA and nonadditive effects on genetic risk between susceptibility loci. Of 6668 included patients, there were 1585 European female individuals with FFA and 5083 controls. Genome-wide significant associations were identified at 4 genomic loci, including a novel susceptibility locus at 5q15, and the association signal could be fine-mapped to a single nucleotide substitution (rs10045403) in the 5' untranslated region of ERAP1 (rs10045403; odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.43; P = 3.6 × 10-8). Within the MHC, FFA risk was statistically independently associated with HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*33:01, HLA-B*07:02, and HLA-B*35:01. FFA risk was affected by genetic variation at the ERAP1 locus only in individuals who carried at least 1 of the MHC class I risk alleles. In this genome-wide meta-analysis, a supra-additive effect of genetic variation was found that affected peptide trimming and antigen presentation on FFA susceptibility. Patients with FFA may benefit from emerging therapeutic approaches that modulate ERAP-mediated processes.

[PMID: 29632046] The Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase I (ERAP1) trims peptides to their optimal size for binding to Major Histocompatibility Complex class I proteins. The natural polymorphism of this enzyme is associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in epistasis with the major risk factor for this disease, HLA-B*27, suggesting a direct relationship between AS and HLA-B*27-bound peptides. Three polymorphisms that affect peptide trimming protect from AS: K528R, D575N/R725Q, and Q730E. We characterized and ranked the effects of each mutation, and their various combinations, by quantitative comparisons of the HLA-B*27 peptidomes from cells expressing distinct ERAP1 variants. Five features were examined: peptide length, N-terminal flanking residues, N-terminal residues of the natural ligands, internal sequences and affinity for B*27:05. Polymorphism at residue 528 showed the largest influence, affecting all five features regardless of peptide length. D575N/R725Q showed a much smaller effect. Yet, when co-occurring with K528R, it further decreased ERAP1 activity. Polymorphism at residue 730 showed a significant influence on peptide length, because of distinct effects on trimming of nonamers compared with longer peptides. Accordingly, multiple features were affected by the Q730E mutation in a length-dependent way. The alterations induced in the B*27:05 peptidome by natural ERAP1 variants with different K528R/Q730E combinations reflected separate and additive effects of both mutations. Thus, the influence of ERAP1 on HLA-B*27 is very diverse at the population level, because of the multiplicity and complexity of ERAP1 variants, and to the distinct effects of their co-occurring polymorphisms, leading to significant modulation of disease risk among HLA-B*27-positive individuals.",2

Although NANOG is phosphorylated at multiple residues, the role of NANOG phosphorylation in ESC self-renewal is incompletely understood, and no information exists regarding its functions during reprogramming. Here we report our findings that NANOG phosphorylation is beneficial, although nonessential, for ESC self-renewal, and that loss of phosphorylation enhances NANOG activity in reprogramming. Mutation of serine 65 in NANOG to alanine (S65A) alone has the most significant impact on increasing NANOG reprogramming capacity. Mechanistically, we find that pluripotency regulators (ESRRB, OCT4, SALL4, DAX1, and TET1) are transcriptionally primed and preferentially associated with NANOG S65A at the protein level due to presumed structural alterations in the N-terminal domain of NANOG. These results demonstrate that a single phosphorylation site serves as a critical interface for controlling context-dependent NANOG functions in pluripotency and reprogramming.

[PMID: 25192464] Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are commonly generated by transduction of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc (OSKM) into cells. Although iPSCs are pluripotent, they frequently exhibit high variation in terms of quality, as measured in mice by chimera contribution and tetraploid complementation. Reliably high-quality iPSCs will be needed for future therapeutic applications. Here, we show that one major determinant of iPSC quality is the combination of reprogramming factors used. Based on tetraploid complementation, we found that ectopic expression of Sall4, Nanog, Esrrb, and Lin28 (SNEL) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) generated high-quality iPSCs more efficiently than other combinations of factors including OSKM. Although differentially methylated regions, transcript number of master regulators, establishment of specific superenhancers, and global aneuploidy were comparable between high- and low-quality lines, aberrant gene expression, trisomy of chromosome 8, and abnormal H2A.X deposition were distinguishing features that could potentially also be applicable to human.",2
Egr2 regulates the homeostasis of B and T cells.,Egr2 AND regulation AND homeostasis AND B cells,"41187382,23021953","[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41186900] Achieving high-quality immune reconstitution (IR) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is directly associated with the patient's ability to resist infections, prevent tumor relapses, and suppress graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The status of CD4 + T cells is critical for reconstituting adaptive immunity after transplantation; however, the patterns of reconstitution and their influencing factors remain unclear. This retrospective cohort study involved 164 patients who underwent myeloablative allo-HSCT from April 2016 to May 2023. Based on the early post-transplantation CD4 + T cell counts, the cohort was divided into two groups: 73 patients with high-quality IR (HIR) and 34 patients with low-quality IR (LIR). LIR was associated with an increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation following transplantation. Plasma EBV viral load was monitored weekly using quantitative PCR for the first 100 days post-transplantation. The LIR group had a higher viral load at the time of the first EBV reactivation and a significantly earlier first reactivation compared to the HIR group. No significant differences were observed in overall survival, GVHD incidence, or relapse rates between the groups. A CD4 + T cell count of < 60 cells/μL within 30 days post-transplantation was associated with a higher incidence of EBV viremia compared to the control group. These findings suggest that early CD4 + T cell counts may serve as a predictive marker for post-transplant EBV infection.",3

[PMID: 41184282] Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes febrile illness and acute or chronic arthritis. Most therapeutics are still in the pre-clinical stage. In this study, we report the isolation of two neutralizing antibodies, C34 and C37, from a convalescent patient and investigate their mechanisms of action. Both C34 and C37 exhibit high neutralizing activities in vitro and demonstrate protective effects against CHIKV in a female mouse model. Our functional and structural studies reveal a mechanism that inhibits multiple stages of the virus infection cycle. Both antibodies bind with high affinity to an epitope spanning E2, E1, and the connecting β-strands, facilitating intra- and inter-virion crosslinking. Cryo-EM structures additionally identify a minor patch located beneath the E3 binding site on E2, which is allosterically exposed upon E3 dissociation during virus maturation. Functional and structural data further suggest that binding to the CHIKV receptor, Mxra8, is obstructed due to a clash between the antibodies and the stalk region of Mxra8. Our results highlight the potential of antibody-based therapeutics against CHIKV and elucidate the mechanisms of monoclonal antibody protection.

Such compounds achieve half-life extension of zanamivir, while recruiting polyclonal immunoglobulins of all isotypes regardless of specificity to infected cells for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Since the influenza A virus (IAV) NA is a tetramer, we produced VHH<sub>kappa</sub> adducts with 1, 2, or 4 zanamivir molecules attached in a site-specific manner, to allow multivalent engagement of NA. Administration of a VHH<sub>kappa</sub> adduct modified with 4 zanamivir molecules (VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan<sub>4</sub>) was ~10-fold more potent in protection against infection with IAV than VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan carrying only a single zanamivir molecule. VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan<sub>4</sub> can be given intranasally to confer full protection against a lethal IAV challenge. The neutralizing antibody titers in the respiratory mucosa and in the circulation, as well as the serum IgG antibody response against the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein, are higher in VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan<sub>4</sub> treated mice that survived the lethal challenge than in controls infected with a sublethal dose of virus. VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan<sub>4</sub> affords protection even when given intranasally weeks prior to a challenge with a lethal dose of IAV. This type of adduct can therefore be applied prophylactically and therapeutically and does not require prior immunization for protection against a lethal dose of IAV.",3
Elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels are associated with mortality.,cell-free mitochondrial DNA AND elevated levels AND mortality AND risk factors,"37221566,33444289,41187332","[PMID: 37221566] Dementia and frailty are common age-related syndromes often linked to chronic inflammation. Identifying the biological factors and pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation is crucial for developing new therapeutic targets. Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) has been proposed as an immune stimulator and potential predictor of mortality in acute illnesses. Dementia and frailty are both associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired cellular energetics, and cell death. The size and abundance of ccf-mtDNA fragments may indicate the mechanism of cell death: long fragments typically result from necrosis, while short fragments arise from apoptosis. We hypothesize that increased levels of necrosis-associated long ccf-mtDNA fragments and inflammatory markers in serum are linked to declines in cognitive and physical function, as well as increased mortality risk. Our study of 672 community-dwelling older adults revealed that inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein, soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 [sTNFR1], and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) positively correlated with ccf-mtDNA levels in serum. Although cross-sectional analysis revealed no significant associations between short and long ccf-mtDNA fragments, longitudinal analysis demonstrated a connection between higher long ccf-mtDNA fragments (necrosis-associated) and worsening composite gait scores over time. Additionally, increased mortality risk was observed only in individuals with elevated sTNFR1 levels. In a community dwelling cohort of older adults, there are cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between ccf-mtDNA and sTNFR1 with impaired physical and cognitive function and increased hazard of death. This work suggests a role for long ccf-mtDNA as a blood-based marker predictive of future physical decline.

Whether circulating cell-free MT-DNA quantitation could be used to predict the risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes remains undetermined.MethodsWe measured circulating MT-DNA levels in prospectively collected, cell-free plasma samples from 97 subjects with COVID-19 at hospital presentation. Our primary outcome was mortality. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, vasopressor, and renal replacement therapy requirements were secondary outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis determined whether MT-DNA levels were independent of other reported COVID-19 risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve assessments were used to compare MT-DNA levels with established and emerging inflammatory markers of COVID-19.ResultsCirculating MT-DNA levels were highly elevated in patients who eventually died or required ICU admission, intubation, vasopressor use, or renal replacement therapy. Multivariate regression revealed that high circulating MT-DNA was an independent risk factor for these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. We also found that circulating MT-DNA levels had a similar or superior area under the curve when compared against clinically established measures of inflammation and emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19 therapy.ConclusionThese results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels are a potential early indicator for poor COVID-19 outcomes.FundingWashington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences COVID-19 Research Program and Washington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences (ICTS) NIH grant UL1TR002345.

Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-E, while statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.4.1. A total of 10 studies with 5,779 patients were analyzed (2,916 with LAAO and 2,863 with anticoagulation). LAAO reduced, though without statistical significance, the incidence of ischemic stroke (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09). However, it showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the overall anticoagulant group (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.80; p = 0.0004). LAAO emerges as a viable strategy to reduce mortality in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, particularly when long-term anticoagulation is not feasible. Its superiority over DOACs and comparable profile to VKAs, along with the absence of periodic INR monitoring and relevant drug interactions, make it an option that may optimize adherence and quality of life.",3
Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.,energy balance AND hypothalamus AND glutamate AND neurotransmission,"37507231,32719118,30310864","[PMID: 37507231] The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a functionally heterogeneous nucleus critical for systemic energy, glucose, and lipid balance. We showed previously that the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) plays essential roles regulating excitatory and inhibitory transmission in SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons of the VMH and facilitating glucose and lipid homeostasis in female mice. Although mGluR5 is also highly expressed in VMH astrocytes in the mature brain, its role there influencing central metabolic circuits is unknown. In contrast to the glucose intolerance observed only in female mice lacking mGluR5 in VMH SF1 neurons, selective depletion of mGluR5 in VMH astrocytes enhanced glucose tolerance without affecting food intake or body weight in both adult female and male mice. The improved glucose tolerance was associated with elevated glucose-stimulated insulin release. Astrocytic mGluR5 male and female mutants also exhibited reduced adipocyte size and increased sympathetic tone in gonadal white adipose tissue. Diminished excitatory drive and synaptic inputs onto VMH Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP<sup>+</sup>) neurons and reduced activity of these cells during acute hyperglycemia underlie the observed changes in glycemic control. These studies reveal an essential role of astrocytic mGluR5 in the VMH regulating the excitatory drive onto PACAP<sup>+</sup> neurons and activity of these cells facilitating glucose homeostasis in male and female mice.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal circuits within the VMH play chief roles in the regulation of whole-body metabolic homeostasis. It remains unclear how astrocytes influence neurotransmission in this region to facilitate energy and glucose balance control. Here, we explored the role of the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, using a mouse model with selective depletion of mGluR5 from VMH astrocytes. We show that astrocytic mGluR5 critically regulates the excitatory drive and activity of PACAP-expressing neurons in the VMH to control glucose homeostasis in both female and male mice. Furthermore, mGluR5 in VMH astrocytes influences adipocyte size and sympathetic tone in white adipose tissue. These studies provide novel insight toward the importance of hypothalamic astrocytes participating in central circuits regulating peripheral metabolism.

[PMID: 32719118] The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) plays chief roles regulating energy and glucose homeostasis and is sexually dimorphic. We discovered that expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) in the VMH is regulated by caloric status in normal mice and reduced in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mutants, which are severely obese and have diminished glucose balance control. These findings led us to investigate whether mGluR5 might act downstream of BDNF to critically regulate VMH neuronal activity and metabolic function. We found that mGluR5 depletion in VMH SF1 neurons did not affect energy balance regulation. However, it significantly impaired insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, lipid metabolism, and sympathetic output in females but not in males. These sex-specific deficits are linked to reductions in intrinsic excitability and firing rate of SF1 neurons. Abnormal excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly and elevated expression of the GABAergic synthetic enzyme GAD67 also cooperate to decrease and potentiate the synaptic excitatory and inhibitory tone onto mutant SF1 neurons, respectively. Notably, these alterations arise from disrupted functional interactions of mGluR5 with estrogen receptors that switch the normally positive effects of estrogen on SF1 neuronal activity and glucose balance control to paradoxical and detrimental. The collective data inform an essential central mechanism regulating metabolic function in females and underlying the protective effects of estrogen against metabolic disease.

[PMID: 30310864] Energy balance is regulated by anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. POMC neurons make extensive projections and are thought to release both amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters. However, whether they communicate directly with NPY/AgRP neurons is debated. Initially, using single-cell RT-PCR, we determined that mouse POMC<sup>eGFP</sup> neurons express <i>Slc17a6</i> (<i>Vglut2</i>) and <i>Slc18a2</i> (<i>Vmat2</i>), but not <i>Slc31a1</i> (<i>Vgat</i>) mRNA, suggesting glutamate and non-canonical GABA release. Quantitative (q)RT-PCR of POMC<sup>eGFP</sup> cells revealed that <i>Vglut2</i> and <i>Vmat2</i> expression was significantly increased in E2- versus oil-treated, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Since 17β-estradiol (E2) is anorexigenic, we hypothesized that an underlying mechanism is enhancement of POMC signaling. Therefore, we optogenetically stimulated POMC neurons in hypothalamic slices to examine evoked release of neurotransmitters onto NPY/AgRP neurons. Using brief light pulses, we primarily observed glutamatergic currents and, based on the paired pulse ratio (PPR), determined that release probability was higher in E2- versus oil-treated, OVX female, congruent with increased <i>Vlgut2</i> expression. Moreover, bath perfusion of the Gq-coupled membrane estrogen receptor (ER) agonist STX recapitulated the effects of E2 treatment. In addition, high-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation generated a slow outward current that reversed near E<sub>k+</sub> and was antagonized by naloxone, indicative of β-endorphin release. Furthermore, individual NPY/AgRP neurons were found to express <i>Oprm1</i>, the transcript for μ-opioid receptor, and DAMGO, a selective agonist, elicited an outward current. Therefore, POMC excitability and neurotransmission are enhanced by E2, which would facilitate decreased food consumption through marked inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons.",3
Environmental factors can influence the development of breast cancer.,environmental factors AND breast cancer AND pollutants AND endocrine disruptors,"41043533,39904262,39226766","[PMID: 41043533] Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and environmental factors such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) contribute to its development and progression. This review examines the roles of four major EDCs-bisphenols, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), parabens, and dioxins-integrating mechanistic and epidemiological evidence. A key pathway is the cross-talk between estrogen receptor (ER) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which regulates proliferation, survival, and immune evasion. Bisphenol A (BPA) promotes proliferation, migration, epigenetic reprogramming, and immune escape. PCBs, particularly PCB-153, are linked to metabolic alterations, inflammation, and variable epidemiological associations. Parabens, common in cosmetics, display estrogenic activity and affect oxidative stress, tumor marker expression, and metastasis. Dioxins, especially TCDD, act via AhR to induce inflammation, immunosuppression, and metastasis, with epidemiological links to cancer risk near emission sources. Collectively, these EDCs disrupt hormonal pathways, alter gene expression, and modulate the tumor microenvironment, underscoring the need for further research, regulation, and public health interventions.

[PMID: 39904262] Current research on the relationship between environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and breast cancer remains insufficient, with limited evidence and inconsistent conclusions. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a robust method for establishing causality, as it reduces biases from confounding factors and reverse causation. This study uses MR to investigate the effects of three types of EDCs, including bisphenols, parabens, and phthalates, on the risk of overall breast cancer and its subtypes-Luminal A, Luminal B, triple negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched, and estrogen receptor-positive/negative. The study also examines the 1400 blood metabolome as potential mediators and explores EDCs-associated DNA methylation changes as potential factors, with a focus on European populations. Our results shows that n-butyl paraben (n-BuP) is positively associated with Luminal A, mono-methyl phthalate is negatively associated with Luminal B, and mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) is positively associated with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mediation analysis reveals that blood metabolites, such as caffeic acid sulfate and the caffeine-to-paraxanthine ratio, mediate the effect of n-BuP on Luminal A, while methylsuccinate mediate the effect of MiBP on TNBC. Epigenetic analysis shows associations between EDCs exposure-related DNA methylation changes at specific CpG sites (cg26325335, cg08537847, cg27454300) and different breast cancer risks. These findings not only suggest potential biomarkers for early detection and intervention but also underscore the imperative for further research to rigorously validate these associations.

[PMID: 39226766] Chemicals emitted from industrial facilities include known or suspected mammary carcinogens and endocrine disruptors, but epidemiologic studies are limited. We evaluated associations between air emissions of multiple carcinogenic chemicals and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in a large prospective U.S. We used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory to estimate historical airborne emissions (1987-1995) of 19 known and probable carcinogens for participants enrolled (1995-1996) in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Among 170,402 women, 15,124 breast cancers were diagnosed through 2018. We constructed inverse distance- and wind-weighted average emissions metrics within 1, 2, 5, and 10 km of the enrollment address for each chemical. We estimated multivariable adjusted HRs and 95 % CIs for categories (quartiles, tertiles, medians) of each chemical in association with breast cancer overall and separately by type (invasive, ductal carcinoma in situ) and estrogen receptor (ER) status. We observed an association between benzene emissions and breast cancer risk that was strongest at 1 km (HR<sub>Q4</sub> vs. non-exposed = 2.06, 95 %CI: 1.34-3.17; p-trend = 0.001). The magnitude of the association weakened with increasing distance (2 km HR<sub>Q4</sub> vs. non-exposed = 1.17, 95 %CI=0.92-1.49; p-trend = 0.19; 5 km HR<sub>Q4</sub> vs. non-exposed = 1.05, 95 %CI=0.94-1.16; p-trend = 0.37; 10 km HR<sub>Q4</sub> vs. non-exposed = 0.95, 95 %CI=0.89-1.02; p-trend = 0.19) and appeared to be most relevant for invasive rather than intraductal disease. Overall risk was also elevated for vinyl chloride at 5 km (HR<sub>≥median</sub> vs. non-exposed = 1.20, 95 %CI=1.01-1.43; p-trend = 0.04), but not 2 km or 10 km. We observed suggestive associations for asbestos, trichloroethylene, and styrene in different subgroup analyses, but risk patterns were not clear across distances. Associations with other chemicals were generally null, with limited evidence of heterogeneity by disease type or ER status. An increased risk of breast cancer associated with relatively high levels of industrial benzene emissions warrants additional study, particularly among participants with diverse sociodemographic characteristics that live in areas with higher density of industrial facilities.",3
Environmentally-induced senescence is mimicked in disease modeling by adding specific molecules to the culture system.,Environmentally-induced senescence AND Disease modeling AND Culture system AND Senescence-inducing molecules,"41187307,41187380,41187325","[PMID: 41187307] Vascular dysfunction contributes to Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRDs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies link midlife hemostasis and platelet aggregation measures to late-life dementia risk. We aimed to determine whether platelet aggregation in midlife is associated with imaging markers of AD pathology. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated associations between platelet aggregation, measured by light transmission aggregometry, and amyloid (<sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET uptake in dementia-free, middle-aged adults from the Framingham Heart Study. Co-primary outcomes included amyloid and tau uptake in AD-vulnerable regions. We also examined an MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk as a secondary outcome. We used multivariable regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, considering potential nonlinear associations. Platelet aggregation response was evaluated in 382 participants (mean age 56 ± 8 years, 53% female) approximately 1.2-1.5 years before amyloid and tau PET imaging. MRI data used for the AD signature were acquired together with PET imaging or within several months. The aggregation response exhibited a nonlinear association with AD pathology. Among those in the lowest tertile of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) response, platelet aggregation response was positively associated with increased amyloid in the precuneus (β = 0.047, <i>p</i> = 0.020) and tau in the rhinal (β = 0.077, <i>p</i> = 0.012), entorhinal (β = 0.066, <i>p</i> < 0.020), temporal global (β = 0.063, <i>p</i> = 0.031), and cortical (β = 0.064, <i>p</i> = 0.028) regions. For the secondary outcome analysis (n = 256), platelet aggregation response was negatively associated with the MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk (β = -0.002, <i>p</i> < 0.035), consistent with a neurodegenerative pattern. Our findings indicate that platelet aggregation is linked to PET and MRI markers of AD pathology as early as midlife. These findings support further investigation of platelet-mediated mechanisms in AD pathogenesis.

[PMID: 41187380] Mutations of the Ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene are generally associated with syndromic tooth agenesis, yet their influence on non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) has not been thoroughly elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of NSTA and to identify pathogenic EDA mutations in two Chinese families using whole-exome sequencing, and explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Two unrelated individuals with NSTA and their families were enrolled in this study, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Whole-exome sequencing was performed, followed by variants detection and filtering to identify pathogenic genes and mutations. The identified genetic mutations were further validated by Sanger sequencing and confirmed to be absent in 300 unrelated healthy individuals. Conservation analysis, three-dimensional (3D) modeling, and electrostatic potential calculations were conducted accordingly. We identified a novel mutation c.827 G>T (p.Arg276Leu) and a previously reported mutation c.1069 C>T (p.Arg357Trp) in the EDA gene, with the latter showing previously unreported phenotypic characteristics. Both mutations are located in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) domain of EDA, which is crucial for binding with ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR). Conservation analysis indicated that these mutations are evolutionarily conserved across various species. In silico predictions and 3D modeling analyses suggested that these mutations may be pathogenic, potentially due to alterations in the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic potential, thereby affecting EDA-EDAR interaction. Our findings broaden the mutation spectrum of EDA gene associated with NSTA by identifying a novel mutation and provide a basis for future genetic counseling.

[PMID: 41187325] Strabismus measurement is essential in vision assessment and screening. It typically requires skilled clinicians or specialized equipment. Photographic strabismus measurement methods have value in terms of accessibility and convenience of use. This study aimed to evaluate Eyeturn Cloud, a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) system for measuring strabismus angles based on eye images captured with smartphone cameras under cover test conditions. The Eyeturn Cloud web app uses AI models to recognize eyes, eye lid, and iris, and then to segment iris precisely. It then computes strabismus based on ellipse fitting of the iris boundary and corneal reflection. The system was evaluated in patients (without glasses) with manifest strabismus and control participants. Clinicians measured eye deviations using the prism alternate cover test and also captured pictures of their eyes under alternate cover and unilateral cover conditions. The pictures were processed by Eyeturn Cloud. In total, 79 (mean age 11.9, SD 6.3 years; esotropia: n=15, exotropia: n=55, orthotropia: n=9) participants were enrolled; of which, data were available for 71 participants (8/79, 10.1% processing failure). The range of prism alternate cover test strabismus magnitude was from 78 base in to 78 base out prism diopters (PDs). A strong correlation was found between Eyeturn Cloud and clinical measurements (R<sup>2</sup>=0.95; slope=0.91; P<.001). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that 95% limits of agreement between the 2 measurements were -20.2 to 14.6 PD. A repeatability test with 15 participants (4 photos each) found a 1.53 PD SD. The cloud AI web app can compute strabismus angles reliably under alternate and unilateral cover conditions in clinical settings, and its potential for use in telehealth settings needs further evaluation.",3
Excess gestational weight gain is associated with obesity-related pregnancy outcomes.,excess gestational weight gain AND obesity-related pregnancy outcomes AND maternal-fetal outcomes AND pregnancy complications,"23074010,37431342,27017177","[PMID: 23074010] Obesity-related infertility is one of the most common problems of reproductive-age obese women who desire childbearing. The various types of bariatric surgeries have proved effective in controlling excessive weight gain, improving fertility, and preventing certain maternal and fetal complications in these women. This article summarizes the current evidence regarding the impact of bariatric surgery on obesity-related infertility and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. We have also attempted to draw conclusions about maternal and fetal risks and the benefits of bariatric surgery. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and Roux-en-Y procedures are the two most commonly performed bariatric surgeries. Bariatric surgery was believed to improve menstrual irregularity and increase ovulation rate in anovulatory obese women, which lead to increased pregnancy rates. Although there are data in the literature suggesting the improvement of both the ovulatory function and the spontaneous pregnancy rates in obese women who lost weight after bariatric surgery, most of these are case-control studies with a small number of patients. The data are insufficient to determine an ideal time interval for pregnancy after bariatric surgery; however, the general consensus is that pregnancy should be delayed 12 to 18 months after bariatric surgery to avoid nutritional deficiencies. Few data exist regarding IVF success rates in women who have undergone bariatric surgery. One pairwise study discussed five patients who underwent bariatric surgery followed by IVF that resulted in three term pregnancies in three patients after the first IVF cycle. Many studies reported reductions in obesity-related pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders after bariatric surgery. Although data are inconsistent, some studies reported increased rate of preterm delivery and small for gestational age infants after bariatric surgery. Pregnancies after bariatric surgery may be considered high risk due to the concerns for vitamin deficiencies and gastrointestinal symptoms related to the surgery. Therefore the follow-up of these pregnancies might require a team approach including a maternal fetal medicine specialist, bariatric surgeon, and nutritionist.

[PMID: 37431342] Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. Until recently, the only effective method for treating morbid obesity over the long term was bariatric surgery (BS). During pregnancy, obesity is correlated with higher risks for numerous complications, including gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, mortality, and large-for-gestational-age neonates. The most commonly reported complications among women who underwent sleeve gastrectomy and experienced pregnancy were placental bleeding, oligohydramnios, urinary tract infection, appendicitis, and recurrent abortions. We aim to estimate the consequence of sleeve gastrectomy and its relation with pregnancy outcomes among women in Saudi Arabia. This study adopted a quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional design. It was conducted in Saudi Arabia between February and May 2023 among women who became pregnant after undergoing sleeve gastrectomy.  Result: Anemia was experienced by 78.8% of the patients during pregnancy. In our study, 18% of the individuals experienced complications during or right after delivery, with postpartum hemorrhage being the most frequent (43.1%). We discovered that pre-eclampsia and delivering a baby small for gestational age were considerably more common in pregnant women who smoked (p ≤ 0.05). On the other hand, no significant association was discovered between any comorbidity and mode of delivery, birth weight, child complications, or difficulties that occurred during or right after labor. We concluded that weight gain after sleeve gastrectomy negatively impacted pregnancy and increased the probability of several complications for the mother and fetus. Healthcare providers must inform every woman undergoing BS about the possible complication of an unhealthy lifestyle after the procedure.

[PMID: 27017177] It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that all women of reproductive age receive education about maternal and fetal risks associated with prepregnancy obesity, excessive gestational weight gain, and significant postpartum weight retention, including potential benefits of lifestyle changes. Behavioral counseling to improve dietary intake and physical activity should be provided to overweight and obese women, beginning in the preconception period and continuing throughout pregnancy, for at least 12 to 18 months postpartum. Weight loss before pregnancy may improve fertility and reduce the risk of poor maternal-fetal outcomes, such as preterm birth, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, assisted delivery, and select congenital anomalies. Lifestyle interventions that moderate gestational weight gain may reduce the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, large for gestational age, and macrosomia, as well as lower the risk for significant postpartum retention. Postpartum interventions that promote healthy diet and physical activity behaviors may reduce postpartum weight retention and decrease obesity-related risks in subsequent pregnancies. Analysis of the evidence suggests that there is good evidence to support the role of diet, physical activity, and behavior changes in promoting optimal weight gain during pregnancy; however, there is currently a relative lack of evidence in other areas related to reproductive outcomes.",3
Exercise reduces cancer mortality rates among Chinese citizens.,Exercise AND Cancer Mortality AND China AND Physical Activity,"41120824,41092928,41184253","[PMID: 41120824] It remains unclear whether achieving the physical activity guidelines through occupational activity alone, nonoccupational activity alone, or combined occupational and nonoccupational activity has different health consequences. Adults aged 18 years or older in the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) from 2007 to 2018 were prospectively observed. Mortality data were acquired from the National Death Index through December 31, 2019. Time of self-reported occupational and nonoccupational activity was calculated. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome, with cardiovascular and cancer mortality as secondary outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the association of occupational and nonoccupational activity with mortality. During a median follow-up of 6.92 years, 23 752 participants were included in our analysis, with 1367 deaths recorded, including 367 cardiovascular and 328 cancer deaths. Compared with inactive participants, those achieving recommended activity levels through occupational activity alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.60-0.94]), nonoccupational activity alone (HR, 0.58, [95% CI, 0.47-0.71]), or combined activity (HR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.33-0.56]) had lower all-cause mortality. Additionally, those achieving recommended activity levels through nonoccupational activity alone (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.36-0.71]) or combined activity (HR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.20-0.57]) had lower cardiovascular mortality. However, occupational activity alone (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.61-1.29]), nonoccupational activity alone (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.66-1.46]), and combined activity (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.38-1.11]) were not associated with cancer mortality. Achieving recommended activity levels through any domain was associated with lower all-cause mortality. Nonoccupational activity alone or combined activity was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. Participants in occupational activity alone may benefit more if they also achieve recommended activity levels through nonoccupational activity.

[PMID: 41092928] Timely and comprehensive analyses of causes of death stratified by age, sex, and location are essential for shaping effective health policies aimed at reducing global mortality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides cause-specific mortality estimates measured in counts, rates, and years of life lost (YLLs). GBD 2023 aimed to enhance our understanding of the relationship between age and cause of death by quantifying the probability of dying before age 70 years (70q0) and the mean age at death by cause and sex. This study enables comparisons of the impact of causes of death over time, offering a deeper understanding of how these causes affect global populations. GBD 2023 produced estimates for 292 causes of death disaggregated by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2023. We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric. Findings are reported as counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2023 include a correction for the misclassification of deaths due to COVID-19, updates to the method used to estimate COVID-19, and updates to the CODEm modelling framework. This analysis used 55 761 data sources, including vital registration and verbal autopsy data as well as data from surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. For GBD 2023, there were 312 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 3 country-years of surveillance data, 51 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 144 country-years of other data types that were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic caused shifts in long-standing rankings of the leading causes of global deaths: it ranked as the number one age-standardised cause of death at Level 3 of the GBD cause classification hierarchy in 2021. By 2023, COVID-19 dropped to the 20th place among the leading global causes, returning the rankings of the leading two causes to those typical across the time series (ie, ischaemic heart disease and stroke). While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause. Compared to 1990, there has been a considerable reduction in total YLLs in many vaccine-preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. In addition, this study quantified the mean age at death for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and found noticeable variation by sex and location. The global all-cause mean age at death increased from 46·8 years (95% UI 46·6-47·0) in 1990 to 63·4 years (63·1-63·7) in 2023. For males, mean age increased from 45·4 years (45·1-45·7) to 61·2 years (60·7-61·6), and for females it increased from 48·5 years (48·1-48·8) to 65·9 years (65·5-66·3), from 1990 to 2023. The highest all-cause mean age at death in 2023 was found in the high-income super-region, where the mean age for females reached 80·9 years (80·9-81·0) and for males 74·8 years (74·8-74·9). By comparison, the lowest all-cause mean age at death occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was 38·0 years (37·5-38·4) for females and 35·6 years (35·2-35·9) for males in 2023. Lastly, our study found that all-cause 70q0 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, although with large variability between them. For females, we found that 70q0 notably increased from drug use disorders and conflict and terrorism. Leading causes that increased 70q0 for males also included drug use disorders, as well as diabetes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there was an increase in 70q0 for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Additionally, the mean age at death from NCDs was lower than the expected mean age at death for this super-region. By comparison, there was an increase in 70q0 for drug use disorders in the high-income super-region, which also had an observed mean age at death lower than the expected value. We examined global mortality patterns over the past three decades, highlighting-with enhanced estimation methods-the impacts of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to broader trends such as increasing NCDs in low-income regions that reflect ongoing shifts in the global epidemiological transition. This study also delves into premature mortality patterns, exploring the interplay between age and causes of death and deepening our understanding of where targeted resources could be applied to further reduce preventable sources of mortality. We provide essential insights into global and regional health disparities, identifying locations in need of targeted interventions to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases. There is an ever-present need for strengthened health-care systems that are resilient to future pandemics and the shifting burden of disease, particularly among ageing populations in regions with high mortality rates. Robust estimates of causes of death are increasingly essential to inform health priorities and guide efforts toward achieving global health equity. The need for global collaboration to reduce preventable mortality is more important than ever, as shifting burdens of disease are affecting all nations, albeit at different paces and scales.

[PMID: 41184253] Glioma is the most common primary brain tumors and has a high recurrence and mortality rate after surgery. Most gliomas are of astrocytic origin. We recently demonstrated that Celsr2 is essential for injury-induced responses and functions of astrocytes, while its role in the development and treatment of gliomas remains unexplored. In this study, an increase of CELSR2 expression was identified in patient glioma samples and glioma cell lines, and higher levels of CELSR2 correlate with poorer patient survival as indicated by TCGA data. In cultured glioma cells, CELSR2 knockdown reduced proliferation and caused cell cycle arrest, which was further supported by proteomic analysis. CELSR2 knockdown inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the effect could be reversed by activating β-catenin using GSK-3β inhibitor in glioma cells. WNT3A efficiently enhanced the proliferation of glioma cells and activated the downstream signaling, which were significantly compromised by CELSR2 knockdown. We developed magnetic nanoparticles loaded with CELSR2-siRNA, which suppressed tumor growth in glioma-inoculated nude mice. In conclusion, CELSR2 positively regulates glioma development through WNT3A/β-catenin signaling and inhibiting CESLR2 is a novel therapeutic strategy for gliomas.",3
Female carriers of the Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele have increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.,Apolipoprotein E4 AND female AND Alzheimer's disease AND risk,"41157904,41074912,41041548","[PMID: 41157904] Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which features early olfactory dysfunction and pathology. However, how APOE ε4 interacts with age and sex to affect cellular and network function in vulnerable regions such as the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) remains unclear. In vivo recordings in awake transgenic mice were used to assess how APOE ε4, age, and sex interact to influence single-cell excitability and network activity. APOE ε4 reduces excitability in the AON; adult females show higher excitability than males, a difference that is lost with age. Excitability and network activity vary by genotype and sex, while aging consistently increases network power, underscoring their complex interplay in an AD-vulnerable circuit. APOE ε4, age, and sex interact to shape excitability and network dynamics in the anterior olfactory nucleus, a region affected early in AD. These actions may underlie early olfactory dysfunction and offer electrophysiological markers for early detection and genotype-, age-, and sex-specific interventions. This is the first study on the interactive impact of three Alzheimer's disease risk factors on anterior olfactory nucleus neural functions. Apolipoprotein E ε4 reduces neuronal excitability regardless of age and sex. Females show higher excitability than males in the adult group but not in aged group. Age increases excitability in a genotype-dependent manner. Network oscillations vary by genotype and sex but are consistently enhanced by age.

[PMID: 41074912] Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic changes, but its contribution to clinical features and pathology in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is less clear. Using the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center dataset, we investigated APOE ε4-associated effects on DLB core clinical features and neuropathology. In analyses of APOE ε4 carriers, dosage, and genetic risk score, APOE ε4 was associated with lower odds of fluctuating cognition and parkinsonism and higher odds of visual hallucinations. APOE ε4 was associated with greater neocortical Lewy body pathology, partially mediated by AD co-pathology. The severity of fluctuating cognition was associated with Lewy body pathology stage after controlling for AD co-pathology. Visual hallucinations were associated with both Lewy body and AD pathologies. Core clinical features of DLB are sensitive to APOE haplotype. Targeting APOE biology may elucidate DLB pathogenesis and inform therapeutic development. Core clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies were sensitive to apolipoprotein E (APOE) haplotype. APOE ε4 was associated with a higher likelihood of hallucinations yet a lower likelihood of cognitive fluctuations. APOE ε4 was associated with greater severity of Lewy body pathology, partially mediated by Alzheimer's disease (AD) co-pathology. Whereas fluctuating cognition was primarily linked to Lewy body pathology, visual hallucinations were associated with both Lewy body and AD neuropathologic changes.

[PMID: 41041548] Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) genotype, hypertension, and biological sex are critical risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Yet, their combined impact on early cerebrovascular dysfunction, brain inflammation, and memory impairment remains poorly understood. We developed a translational mouse model incorporating human ApoE4, hypertension via angiotensin II infusion, and induced accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) to mimic perimenopause in females to investigate these interactions. Hypertensive ApoE4 mice of both sexes exhibited impaired spatial working memory, decreased cerebral blood flow, increased neuroinflammation, and decreased blood brain barrier integrity, recapitulating key early clinical features observed in human populations with these risk factors. Brain blood flow reduction was associated with an increased incidence of capillary stalling, with notable sex differences in the extent and cellular composition of stalls: in males, stalling was strongly elevated and mostly due to red blood cell arrest, while stalling was modestly elevated in peri-AOF females with most stalls including leukocytes. Treatment with prasugrel, a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, improved memory performance in both sexes but was correlated with different physiological effects - restored cerebral blood flow in males and reduced microglia motility and inflammation in peri-AOF females. Platelet depletion mimicked prasugrel's blood flow and cognitive benefits in males, while microglia depletion selectively rescued memory in females. Our work emphasizes the necessity of including translationally relevant female mouse models in neurodegenerative disease studies, and our findings highlight the importance of risk profile-specific interventions and demonstrate that early vascular dysfunction may be a key, sex-dependent driver of cognitive decline.",3
Female carriers of the Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele have longer lifetime exposure to estrogen due to an increased reproductive period.,APOE4 AND female carriers AND estrogen exposure AND increased reproductive period,"41186980,41186948,41187066","[PMID: 41186980] In Lebanon, disadvantaged pregnant women show poor maternal outcomes due to limited access to antenatal care (ANC) and a strained health care system, compounded by ongoing conflicts and a significant refugee population. Despite substantial efforts to improve maternal health, the provision of maternal health services in primary health care centers (PHCs) still faces significant challenges. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, particularly those using artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification, are proving effective in addressing gaps in maternal health services by offering scalable and accessible care. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an AI-based gamified intervention, Gamification and Artificial Intelligence and mHealth Network for Maternal Health Improvement (GAIN MHI), on maternal health outcomes and uptake of ANC services among disadvantaged populations in Lebanon. The study was a community interventional trial with historical controls, conducted across 19 randomly allocated PHCs in 5 Lebanese governorates. Participants included pregnant women in their first trimester visiting PHCs. The intervention used mHealth tools, including educational mobile-based messages, appointment reminders, and the GAIN MHI app, which provided AI-driven and gamified learning for health care providers (HCPs). Data collected covered demographics, medical history, and maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Key outcome measures included uptake of health care services (eg, ANC visits, supplement intake, ultrasound completion, lab tests) and maternal and neonatal outcomes (eg, term delivery, normal delivery, abortion rate, neonatal morbidity, maternal complications). This study included 3989 participants, divided between a control group (n=1993, 50%) and an intervention group (n=1996, 50%). Regression models adjusting for demographics, health, and obstetric characteristics showed significantly higher odds in the intervention group for completing 4 or more ANC visits (odds ratio [OR] 1.569, 95% CI 1.329-1.852, P<.05), completing lab tests (OR 1.821, 95% CI 1.514-2.191, P<.05), 2 or more ultrasound screenings (OR 7.984, 95% CI 6.687-9.523, P<.05), urine analysis (OR 4.399, 95% CI 3.631-5.330, P<.05), and supplement intake (OR 3.508, 95% CI 2.982-4.128, P<.05). Regarding outcomes, the intervention group had 29.5% increased odds of a term delivery (OR 1.295, 95% CI 1.095-1.532, P=.002) and 58% increased odds of avoiding neonatal morbidity (OR 1.580, 95% CI 1.185-2.108, P=.002). However, both groups showed decreased odds of normal delivery (intervention: OR 0.774, 95% CI 0.657-0.911; control: OR 0.823, 95% CI 0.701-0.964) and increased odds of maternal complications (intervention: OR 0.535, 95% CI 0.449-0.637; control: OR 0.586, 95% CI 0.474-0.723; P<.05). The GAIN MHI intervention effectively improves uptake of ANC and maternal and neonatal outcomes. Our findings highlight the potential of mHealth interventions to enhance health care delivery. To sustain these improvements, future research should focus on integrating mHealth with other interventions that address socioeconomic and contextual factors. This approach will further optimize maternal and neonatal health outcomes among disadvantaged populations.

[PMID: 41186948] Advanced imaging to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE) during pregnancy increases costs, ionizing radiation exposure, and the risk of overdiagnosis. D-dimer testing can exclude PE and compression ultrasonography can diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), both reducing advanced imaging needs. How these 2 strategies are used in community PE diagnostics is unknown. To analyze the use and efficiencies of D-dimer and ultrasonography for the diagnosis of antenatal PE. This retrospective cohort study was performed in 21 US community hospitals from October 1, 2021, to March 31, 2023. Participants included pregnant patients who underwent D-dimer testing, compression ultrasonography, or advanced imaging for suspected PE. D-dimer testing or ultrasonography. The main outcome was avoidance of advanced imaging, measured by the number needed to test (NNT) to avoid 1 advanced imaging study using low to intermediate D-dimer values or a positive ultrasonography finding. Variables associated with D-dimer and ultrasonography were evaluated using quasi-Poisson regression reported as adjusted relative risks (ARRs). A total of 720 outpatient encounters in 699 patients were included in the analysis (median age, 30.2 [IQR, 24.3-36.1] years). D-dimer testing was obtained in 524 patients (72.8%). Advanced imaging was not pursued in 149 of 155 patients (96.1%) with low (<0.5 mg/L) and 82 of 179 (45.8%) with intermediate (0.5 to <1.0 mg/L) D-dimer values, yielding an NNT to avoid 1 advanced imaging study of 2.3 (95% CI, 2.0-2.6). No 90-day venous thromboembolism or death occurred following rule-outs. D-dimer testing was less commonly used in third (vs first) trimester (ARR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97); with unilateral signs or symptoms of DVT (vs none) (ARR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.82), and during labor and delivery unit (vs emergency department) evaluation (ARR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20-0.35). Compression ultrasonography was performed in 229 patients (31.8%), with DVT diagnosed in 3 (1.3%). Advanced imaging was not pursued in 2 of these patients, yielding an NNT to avoid 1 advanced imaging study of 115 (95% CI, 32-417). Ultrasonography use and results varied by DVT symptoms. Among 55 patients with DVT symptoms, 46 (83.6%) underwent ultrasonography, with positive findings in 3 (yield of 6.5%). Among 665 patients without symptoms, 183 (27.5%) underwent ultrasonography, with negative findings in all (yield of 0). In this cohort study, use of D-dimer testing was efficient and safe with opportunities for expansion across settings and patients. These findings suggest that ultrasonography efficiency was low but could be improved with symptom-driven use in antenatal PE diagnostics.

[PMID: 41187066] Mice often serve as valuable surrogate models for studying human reproduction. This study provides a single-cell transcriptomic profile of mouse immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout pregnancy and assesses the similarities and differences between these immune cells and human decidual immune cells. Homeostasis of the immune microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface is essential for pregnancy. Immune cell heterogeneity at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnant mice remains understudied. Here, we perform in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analysis with 120,238 maternal-fetal single cells of mice from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E18.5 and in vitro experiments to establish an immune cell atlas. Macrophages constitute the largest population, with some subsets resembling human counterparts, and the number of Ccr2 + macrophages in the decidua increases as pregnancy progresses. Neutrophils constitute the second largest population, and Ifit1 + N2 neutrophils are localized close to the implantation site during early pregnancy. Three NK cell subsets were identified, including the previously reported NK1.1 - subset. In combination with in vitro experiments, the presence of T and B cells within the decidua was validated. Our work profiles a comprehensive immune cell atlas of the mouse maternal-fetal interface, offering a valuable reference for further investigations.",3
Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against atherosclerosis by modulating adiponectin and SREBP2 levels.,FGF21 AND atherosclerosis AND adiponectin AND SREBP2,26872317,"[PMID: 26872317] The serum total and LDL cholesterol levels of long-term vegans tend to be very low. The characteristically low ratio of saturated to unsaturated fat in vegan diets, and the absence of cholesterol in such diets, clearly contribute to this effect. But there is reason to suspect that the quantity and composition of dietary protein also play a role in this regard. Vegan diets of moderate protein intake tend to be relatively low in certain essential amino acids, and as a result may increase hepatic activity of the kinase GCN2, which functions as a gauge of amino acid status. GCN2 activation boosts the liver's production of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a factor which favorably affects serum lipids and metabolic syndrome. The ability of FGF21 to decrease LDL cholesterol has now been traced to at least two mechanisms: a suppression of hepatocyte expression of sterol response element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), which in turn leads to a reduction in cholesterol synthesis; and up-regulated expression of hepatocyte LDL receptors, reflecting inhibition of a mechanism that promotes proteasomal degradation of these receptors. In mice, the vascular benefits of FGF21 are also mediated by favorable effects on adipocyte function - most notably, increased adipocyte secretion of adiponectin, which directly exerts anti-inflammatory effects on the vasculature which complement the concurrent reduction in LDL particles in preventing or reversing atherosclerosis. If, as has been proposed, plant proteins preferentially stimulate glucagon secretion owing to their amino acid composition, this would represent an additional mechanism whereby plant protein promotes FGF21 activity, as glucagon acts on the liver to boost transcription of the FGF21 gene.",1

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of Hyp in the treatment of NSCLC using a combination of network pharmacology and in vitro experiments. Active targets of Hyp and NSCLC-related targets were identified using public databases. The therapeutic targets were predicted based on the intersection of drug and disease targets. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING and Cytoscape, and key network modules and targets were identified through network topology analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID. Molecular docking between Hyp and therapeutic targets was performed using AutoDock Vina software. These results were further verified by in vitro experiments of A549 cell lines, including the CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, flow cytometry and western blotting. A total of 30 therapeutic targets of Hyp against NSCLC were identified. Analysis of the PPI network revealed a key network module and five key targets: MMP9, CASP3, MAPK1, ESR1, and EGFR. These targets were related to cell proliferation and migration, apoptosis, and oxidative stress and may play a role through the FoxO, MAPK, Rap1, Ras, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Molecular docking results showed a strong binding affinity between Hyp and most therapeutic targets. Further experiments confirmed that Hyp inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of A549 cells by regulating the EGFR/ERK/FOXO1 signaling pathway. Hyp may be a promising drug for treating NSCLC (especially lung adenocarcinoma), and its therapeutic mechanisms is closely related to the regulation of EGFR/ERK/FOXO1 pathway.

[PMID: 41151691] Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a reproductive disorder characterized by the early loss of ovarian function in women under 40 years of age. PFAS, especially PFOA and PFOS, have been implicated in ovarian dysfunction, but their mechanisms of action remain unclear. In this study, an integrative network toxicology approach was applied, combining target prediction, gene enrichment analysis, machine learning based feature selection, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, with transcriptomic validation using the GSE127453 dataset. 83 overlapping targets between PFAS and POI were identified. GO enrichment analysis indicated significant involvement in nuclear receptor mediated transcriptional regulation, including steroid hormone receptor and estrogen receptor signalin, KEGG analysis highlighted pathways related to progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, cellular senescence, and the FoxO signaling pathway, implying dual toxicological mechanisms involving impaired oocyte development and accelerated ovarian cell aging. Eight core genes were identified, including SHBG, CDC25A, TPO, BMP2, MAPK1, CASP3, CDK2, and ESR1. Among them, BMP2, CDK2, SHBG, and TPO were downregulated, while CASP3 and ESR1 were upregulated in POI samples. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed stable, high affinity interactions between PFAS and CASP3, supporting a potential role in apoptosis activation. Nonetheless, further in vitro, in vivo, and mixture-based studies are warranted to substantiate these computational predictions and clarify dose-response relationships.

[PMID: 40819162] Heart failure (HF) is a common clinical syndrome caused by ventricular dysfunction and one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Previous studies have suggested that anoikis is relevant to HF. This study aimed to identify hub genes associated with anoikis that may offer therapeutic targets for HF. Gene expression data for GSE36074 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and anoikis-related genes (ARGs) were extracted from GeneCards. GEO2R was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs), then by overlapping DEGs with ARGs, differentially expressed ARGs (DEARGs) were screened. The biological functions of the DEARGs were determined using DAVID. Subsequently, two machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to identify hub DEARGs: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest (RF). In addition, miRNA-hub DEARGs and drug-hub DEARGs networks were constructed. Lastly, the hub DEARGs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Immunofluorescence (IF). A total of 138 DEARGs were identified in GSE36074. Functional analysis of DEARGs revealed that they were primarily enriched in the positive regulation of the apoptotic process, PI3K-Akt, and FoxO signaling pathways. Subsequently, two hub DEARGs (Tln1 and TGFβ2) were screened using LASSO and RF algorithms. According to the miRNA-hub DEARGs networks, Tln1 and TGFβ2 were regulated by 34 and 68 miRNAs, respectively. Moreover, drug-hub DEARGs networks showed that Gemogenovatucel-t, Lerdelimumab, Belagenpumatucel-l, Fresolimumab, Bintrafusp alfa, Trabedersen and Luspatercept-aamt are potential drugs that could target TGFβ2. Finally, RT-qPCR and IF validation of two key DEARGs (Tln1 and TGFβ2) supported our bioinformatics analysis. These findings suggest that Tln1 and TGFβ2 may play important roles in HF development through the regulation of anoikis and may serve as therapeutic targets for HF. Not applicable.",3

[PMID: 41186886] Procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1) is important for extracellular matrix formation and is involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer; however, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mechanistic importance of PLOD1 as a regulator of GC. We examined the potential function and prognostic efficiency of PLOD1 in GC using a variety of bioinformatics methods. In vitro, we assessed the ability of PLOD1 to regulate GC by CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, and Elisa assay analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of PLOD1 on the immune escape of GC cells by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Elisa assay. Analysis of PLOD1 expression in gastric cancer and other cancers in public databases as well as survival showed that low expression of PLOD1 has better survival, while the AUC area under the ROC curve of this gene showed that this gene has better prognostic value. Meanwhile, the results of correlation analysis between PLOD1 and 60 immune checkpoints showed that the gene was positively correlated with immune checkpoint genes, and one of the genes with the largest correlation was CD276, and the pearson's correlation between PLOD1 and cancer immune cycle was also calculated, and the relationship between PLOD1 and the immune microenvironment was evaluated, and the enrichment of the immune infiltration analysis into a larger number of immune cells among which the importance of PLOD1 was determined. Differential gene analysis was then performed on the gastric cancer dataset, using the differential genes to perform WGCNA network co-expression analysis with the PLOD1 gene, and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed on these differential genes, enriching for cancer-related pathways and cell cycle signaling pathways. Two key genes were then obtained in the analysis with glycolysis, while drug sensitivity analysis was performed, yielding multiple potential drugs such as AZD7545, BRD-K03911514 and BRD-K14844214. Furthermore, in vitro experiments further demonstrated that PLOD1 increased the proliferation and migration ability of GC cells by promoting immune escape. The results of this study suggest that PLOD1 is an important regulator of GC progression and participates in the immune escape process of GC, which is expected to be a potential target for GC treatment.

GD2 is a suitable target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy due to its overexpression in several solid tumors. In this preclinical study, we investigated the potential use of iCasp9.2A.GD2.CAR-CD28.4-1BBζ (CAR.GD2) T-cells as a treatment option for patients who have GD2-positive sarcomas and we sought to identify factors shaping hostile tumor microenvironment in this setting. GD2 expression was evaluated by flow-cytometry on primary tumor biopsies of pediatric sarcoma patients. GD2 expression in sarcoma cells was also evaluated in response to an enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitor (Tazemetostat). The antitumor activity of CAR.GD2 T-cells was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of orthotopic and/or metastatic soft-tissue and bone sarcomas. GD2 expression was detected in 55% of the primary tumors. Notably, the Osteosarcoma and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcomas subtypes exhibited the highest GD2 expression levels, while Ewing sarcoma showed the lowest. CAR.GD2 T-cells show a significant tumor control both in vitro and in vivo models of GD2-expressing tumors. Pretreatment with an EZH2 inhibitor (Tazemetostat) upregulating GD2 expression, sensitizes GD2<sup>dim</sup> sarcoma cells to CAR.GD2 T-cells cytotoxic activity. Moreover, in mouse models of disseminated Rhabdomyosarcomas and orthotopic Osteosarcoma, CAR.GD2 T-cells showed both a vigorous anti-tumor activity and long-term persistence as compared to un-transduced T-cells. The presence of immunosuppressive murine myeloid-derived suppressor (MDSC) cells significantly reduces long-term anti-tumour activity of infused CAR.GD2 T-cells. Tumor-derived G-CSF was found to be one of the key factors driving expansion of immunosuppressive murine and human MDSC, thus indirectly limiting the efficacy of CAR.GD2 T-cells. Our preclinical data strongly suggest that CAR.GD2 T-cells hold promise as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with GD2-positive sarcomas. Strategies to tackle hostile immunosuppressive MDSC are desirable to optimize CAR.GD2 T-cell activity.

[PMID: 39695096] The role of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in regulating the antitumor immune response in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) remains poorly understood. Here we transcriptionally and phenotypically profiled non-malignant (CD19<sup>-</sup> CD138<sup>-</sup>) BM cells from WM patients with a focus on myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) to provide a deeper understanding of their role in WM. We found that HLA-DR<sup>low</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs were significantly increased in WM patients as compared to normal controls, with an expansion of predominantly polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs. Single-cell immunogenomic profiling of WM MDSCs identified an immune-suppressive gene signature with upregulated inflammatory pathways associated with interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling. Gene signatures associated with an inflammatory and immune suppressive environment were predominately expressed in PMN-MDSCs. In vitro, WM PMN-MDSCs demonstrated robust T-cell suppression and their viability and expansion was notably enhanced by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and TNFα. Furthermore, BM malignant B-cells attracted PMN-MDSCs to a greater degree than monocytic MDSCs. Collectively, these data suggest that malignant WM B cells actively recruit PMN-MDSCs which promote an immunosuppressive BM microenvironment through a direct T cell inhibition, while release of G-CSF/TNFα in the microenvironment further promotes PMN-MDSC expansion and in turn immune suppression. Targeting PMN-MDSCs may therefore represent a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with WM.

Balb/C mice bearing orthotopic Renca tumors were treated with NIH/3T3-LendSN or, as a control, with NIH/3T3-LXSN cells. At the end of in vivo experiment, plasma and tissue lung samples were collected. Plasma ES and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels were measured by ELISA and Milliplex, respectively. Quantification of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells and their subsets was performed by flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSC using the DCFDA marker by flow cytometry. Metastatic RCC (mRCC) induced expansions of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSC and promoted accumulation of these cells and their subtypes in lymphoid organ and metastases. ES treatment promoted low G-CSF plasmatic levels which were produced by the tumor microenvironment, reflecting the reduced metastatic accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSC in the lungs. However, the therapy was selective for granulocytic cells, thus reducing the production of ROS. These findings confirm the expansion of MDSC during metastatic progression of RCC and indicate the important role of ES in reducing MDSC and possible use of ES therapy in combined anticancer treatment.",3

Asthma may be triggered by allergens, certain medications, environmental exposure, respiratory infection, and physical exertion. Patients with asthma express higher levels of T helper cell 2 (Th2) cytokines i.e., IL-4 and IL-5. Estragole (EST), a phytochemical in essential oils, has shown anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Current study was set out with the objectives to evaluate the anti-asthmatic effects of EST using various in vivo and in vitro experiments. Thirty-six (36) albino BALB/c mice were divided into six groups: Normal group (NG), OVA-induced asthma group (DG), Methylprednisolone group (MPG group, 15 mg/kg), Low, medium and high doses of EST (LDE: 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg, respectively). Mice were sensitized with 20 µg of OVA intraperitoneally and treated with EST during the challenge phase (21-27 days). Lung wet/dry ratio, total and differential leukocyte counts (TLC and DLC) in blood and Bronchoalveolar Lavage fluid (BALF) collections, histopathology (H&E, PAS), mRNA expressions of IL-4 and IL-5 in the lungs were analyzed, and molecular docking was performed. Airway inflammation was found ameliorated in EST treated groups as evident by reduction in TLC and DLC in both blood and BALF samples, and attenuation of infiltration of inflammatory cells in lungs. Furthermore, EST significantly reduced IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression levels in the lungs tissue and demonstrated notable binding affinity with IL-4 (- 4.5 kcal/mol), IL-5 (- 4.7 kcal/mol), and GATA-3 (- 5.3 kcal/mol). These docking results support the in vivo findings by suggesting a possible interaction of EST with key Th2 mediators, and their transcriptional regulator to suppress downstream airway inflammation, consistent with its observed anti-asthmatic effects.

GATA3 regulates self-renewal capacity in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells.,GATA3 AND self-renewal capacity AND bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells AND regulation,"23974957,41187377,23974957","[PMID: 23974957] The transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed and required for differentiation and function throughout the T lymphocyte lineage. Despite evidence it may also be expressed in multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), any role for GATA-3 in these cells has remained unclear. Here we found GATA-3 was in the cytoplasm in quiescent long-term stem cells from steady-state bone marrow but relocated to the nucleus when HSCs cycled. Relocation depended on signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and was associated with a diminished capacity for long-term reconstitution after transfer into irradiated mice. Deletion of Gata3 enhanced the repopulating capacity and augmented the self-renewal of long-term HSCs in cell-autonomous fashion without affecting the cell cycle. Our observations position GATA-3 as a regulator of the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in HSCs that acts downstream of the p38 signaling pathway.

[PMID: 41187377] Foodborne contaminants, such as mycotoxins and microplastics, pose significant threats to human health due to their high toxicity and persistence in the food chain, thus necessitate effective mitigation strategies. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), characterized by high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, safety, and environmental friendliness, offer a promising solution for adsorbing these pollutants. This review systematically explores the roles, binding locations, interaction forces, and molecular mechanisms underlying LAB-contaminant interactions, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetic properties of the adsorption processes. Notably, LAB strains with outstanding adsorption capabilities are spotlighted, along with innovative enhancement strategies: optimized culture conditions, co-culture systems, nanoparticle functionalization, immobilized cells, and combinations with bio-adsorbents. The review further demonstrates the applications of LAB in ensuring safe food production and maintaining biological health. Future directions include multi-omics-driven gene discovery, genetic engineering techniques for precision regulation, and machine learning for adsorption optimization, advancing mechanistic insights and interdisciplinary solution.

Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori increases risk of gastric cancer in humans.,Helicobacter pylori AND Gastric infection AND Gastric cancer AND Risk factor,"41172430,41180786,41174585","[PMID: 41172430] The late diagnosis of gastric cancer, which is usually diagnosed via upper digestive endoscopy, may be attributed to the failure to detect precursor lesions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of gastric cancer and its precursor lesions in individuals undergoing routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopies at a tertiary hospital in Brazil. Patients aged >40 years who had undergone diagnostic endoscopic examinations in 2017 at our institution were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. We exclude patients with more than one examination in the time-period, without gastric biopsies, and those with autoimmune atrophic gastritis and history of gastric surgery. The histopathological findings were reviewed by two gastrointestinal pathologists. The Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) classification was used in cases wherein gastric mapping was performed. Descriptive statistical analysis for the diagnostic findings of the malignant precursor lesions and gastric cancer was performed using Chi-square test. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Among the 1,071 patients (64.6% females; age 60±10.4 years old) who underwent endoscopic examinations, 277 (25.9%) were diagnosed with malignant precursor lesions or cancer, three (0.3%) dysplastic lesions, and 12 (1.1%) neoplasms. A total of 888 patients underwent gastric mapping; OLGA III and IV stages were observed in 46 (5.2%) patients. Chi-square test revealed significant correlations between dysplastic and neoplastic lesions and male sex, age >80 years and the prevalence of chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, and age 40-49 years and the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Precursor lesions for gastric cancer were observed in up to 25% of the patients, with a predominance of low-risk lesions. Further prospective studies must be conducted to evaluate the risk of gastric cancer in individuals with precursor lesions and formulate prevention strategies.

[PMID: 41180786] Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases. In clinical practice AI consists of overlapping technologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and generative AI. ML is a computer learning system that can provide insight into disease risk factors and phenotypes. Deep learning is an advanced and complex form of ML, structured with different levels of specific algorithms known as convolutional neural networks that can rapidly and accurately process unstructured, high-dimensional data, such as texts, images, and waveforms. Natural language processing is dedicated to facilitating interactions between computers and humans using natural language and helps to analyze, understand, and derive actionable information from unstructured healthcare data, including electronic health records, clinical notes, medical literature, and patient-generated content. Computer vision focuses on enabling computers to see and interpret images and videos and serves as an augmentation tool for endoscopists, improving accuracy and decreasing procedural time. Generative AI is capable of creating new forms of content by learning from a large body of data in the form of text, audio, images, or video and includes large language models. AI has been used in several GI diseases such as esophageal neoplasia, gastric cancer, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection, gastritis, GI stromal tumors, colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, GI bleeding, and pancreatobiliary diseases. The potential applications of AI in liver diseases encompass a variety of conditions such as liver masses, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver transplantation. This review discussed the common terminologies and the current status of AI in gastroenterology and hepatology, exploring its applications and ethical issues.

[PMID: 41174585] To develop and validate a prognostic model incorporating microRNA-1246 (miR-1246), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), α1-antitrypsin (A1AT), and inflammatory markers for predicting outcomes in early gastric cardia cancer after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). We retrospectively enrolled 280 patients with early gastric cardia cancer who underwent ESD between January 2021 and December 2023. Patients were divided into a training set (n = 196) and a validation set (n = 84) at a ratio of 7:3. Influencing factors were screened using univariate, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and multivariate logistic regression analyses in the training set. A nomogram was constructed, and the predictive performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical value. The incidence of poor prognosis was comparable between training (43.88%) and validation set (34.52%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified miR-1246, HMGB-1, A1AT, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and Helicobacter pylori infection as independent risk factors for poor prognosis (All P < 0.05). The nomogram demonstrated acceptable discriminative ability, with AUC of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.701-0.877) in the training set and 0.735 (95% CI: 0.638-0.835) in the validation set. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.625 and 0.841 for the training set, and 0.481 and 0.786 for the validation set, respectively. Calibration curves indicated good agreement between predicted and observed probabilities. The proposed prognostic model offers a practical tool for individualized risk assessment post-ESD. However, the clinical application warrants further validation in large-scale, multi-center prospective studies with long-term follow-up.",3

Depending on various factors including cation binding, G4s can fold into different topologies, which can be linked to distinct function. In cells, G4 folding, function, and unfolding is affected by proteins that specifically target G4s. Zuo1 is a G4-binding protein in yeast. To investigate Zuo1 binding and its consequences on G4 formation and topology, we characterized Zuo1's interaction with G4s, both in vitro and in vivo. The C-terminus (Zuo1348-433) of Zuo1 interacts with the G4s. We characterized this interaction by combining nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET), and in vivo experiments with G4IX that is located on yeast chromosome IX. The Zuo1-G4IX interaction stabilizes this G4 structure and triggers conformational shifts depending on the cation environment. The data presented here demonstrate that Zuo1 targets a specific conformation state of G4 IX, modulates G4 toppology.

[PMID: 41181104] Age-related accumulation of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), causing clonal hematopoiesis (CH), often precedes the development of hematologic malignancies. Chronic inflammation and aberrant cytokine expression that are common in aging, contribute to clonal expansion and genomic instability. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an (epi)genetically and physiologically diverse malignancy, characterized by clonal proliferation and incomplete differentiation of HSPCs. The innate immune system, with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), plays a pivotal role in maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis. Dysregulated signaling through PRRs disrupts hematopoiesis, fostering malignant cell proliferation. In addition, cytokines and interferons exert multifaceted effects on HSPCs, impacting their proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Therapeutic approaches targeting innate immune pathways, offer promising avenues for treating hematologic malignancies. Understanding the intricate crosstalk between innate immunity and hematopoiesis would provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for combating hematologic malignancies, offering hope for improved patient outcomes and survival. In this review, we discuss about the malfunctioning innate immune-inflammatory axes in the context of abnormal hematopoiesis and the therapeutic approaches that are utilizing/targeting these pathways with efficacy. This review delves into the derangements of innate immune and inflammatory pathways implicated in the development of AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), shedding light on the therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.",3
Genetic deficiency of mast cells leads to decreased weight gain in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.,Mast cell deficiency AND Weight gain AND Mouse model AND Diet-induced obesity,"27933062,25955205,41187274","[PMID: 27933062] Obesity-related adipose tissue (AT) inflammation that promotes metabolic dysregulation is associated with increased AT mast cell numbers. Mast cells are potent inducers of inflammatory responses and could potentially contribute to obesity-induced AT inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Conflicting findings were reported on obesity-related metabolic dysfunction in mast cell-deficient mice, thus creating a controversy that has not been resolved to date. Whereas traditional <i>Kit</i> hypomorphic mast cell-deficient strains featured reduced diet-induced obesity and diabetes, a <i>Kit</i>-independent model of mast cell deficiency, Cpa3<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, displayed no alterations in obesity and insulin sensitivity. Herein, we analyzed diet-induced obesity in <i>Mcpt5-Cre R-DTA</i> mice, in which the lack of mast cells is caused by a principle different from mast cell deficiency in Cpa3<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice or <i>Kit</i> mutations. We observed no difference between mast cell-deficient and -proficient mice in diet-induced obesity with regards to weight gain, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, metabolic parameters, hepatic steatosis, and AT or liver inflammation. We conclude that mast cells play no essential role in obesity and related pathologies.

[PMID: 25955205] Obesity, insulin resistance, and related pathologies are associated with immune-mediated chronic inflammation. Kit mutant mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and associated co-morbidities, and this phenotype has previously been attributed to their lack of mast cells. We performed a comprehensive metabolic analysis of Kit-dependent Kit(W/Wv) and Kit-independent Cpa3(Cre/+) mast-cell-deficient mouse strains, employing diet-induced or genetic (Lep(Ob/Ob) background) models of obesity. Our results show that mast cell deficiency, in the absence of Kit mutations, plays no role in the regulation of weight gain or insulin resistance. Moreover, we provide evidence that the metabolic phenotype observed in Kit mutant mice, while independent of mast cells, is immune regulated. Our data underscore the value of definitive mast cell deficiency models to conclusively test the involvement of this enigmatic cell in immune-mediated pathologies and identify Kit as a key hematopoietic factor in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.

Genetic deletion of JAM-A increases gut permeability.,JAM-A AND genetic deletion AND gut permeability AND intestinal barrier,"41186416,41186792,41186249","[PMID: 41186416] Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes severe intestinal disease in piglets, employs sophisticated strategies to subvert host antiviral immunity. While type III interferons (IFN-III) play a pivotal role in mucosal defense at intestinal epithelial barriers, the mechanisms underlying PEDV evasion of IFN-III signaling remain poorly understood. Given that peroxisomes serve as critical platforms for IFN-III signaling and that their abundance influences immune activation, we investigated the role of pexophagy in PEDV-mediated immune evasion. We demonstrated that the PEDV nonstructural protein NSP8 functions as a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-dependent IFN-III production. Functional analyses revealed that NSP8 significantly reduces peroxisomal protein levels and promotes pexophagy. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry identified a direct interaction between NSP8 and PEX13. NSP8 also induces dose-dependent degradation of PEX13 via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. This downregulation of PEX13 triggers ubiquitination of the peroxisomal import receptor PEX5, facilitating its recognition by the autophagy receptor NBR1 and the ubiquitin ligase PEX2, thereby promoting autophagic clearance of peroxisomes. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel immune evasion strategy in which PEDV exploits NSP8 to disrupt peroxisome homeostasis by targeting PEX13, thereby dismantling MAVS-dependent IFN-III antiviral signaling through pexophagy. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) NSP8 is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in viral replication. Investigating the functional mechanisms of NSP8 contributes to a deeper understanding of PEDV pathogenesis and supports the development of antiviral strategies against coronaviruses. In this study, we elucidate how NSP8 suppresses type Ⅲ interferon (IFN-Ⅲ) production by promoting pexophagy through the downregulation of PEX13. We demonstrate that NSP8 directly interacts with PEX13 and enhances the ubiquitination of PEX5, leading to reduced peroxisome abundance and impaired mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated IFN-Ⅲ signaling. These findings suggest that NSP8 hijacks the PEX13-dependent pexophagy pathway as a means of evading host antiviral defenses. This work provides critical insights into the interplay between viral proteins and host cellular machinery and highlights the NSP8-PEX13 axis as a promising target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing antiviral immunity against PEDV and related coronaviruses.

[PMID: 41186792] Estrogen is classically considered an essential hormone signal and exerts profound effects on several physiological and pathological states, including gut health. Estrogen deficiency after menopause in most women leads to increased androgenicity and changes in body composition. It is recommended to manipulate the composition of gut bacteria, which alters gut integrity and hence leads to gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis. Normally, the gut maintains its epithelial microvilli integrity with the help of intestinal barriers, such as tight junction (TJ) proteins (claudin, occludin, and epithelial cadherin), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, formic acid, and butyric acid), and mucin. Estrogen influences the bacteria present in the gut. It appears to safeguard the integrity of the gut by inhibiting the breakdown of SCFAs, TJ proteins, and mucin. This protective mechanism serves to prevent the onset of dysbiosis. The estrobolome specialises in the processing of estrogen, playing a pivotal role in regulating estrogen metabolism within the gut. This imbalance is intricately linked to alterations in the estrobolome and endobolome, thereby influencing estrogen metabolism and availability. The estrogen deficiency and associated expressions of TJ proteins, SCFAs, and mucin advance the progression of postmenopausal-induced gynaecological disorders. However, the alterations in the composition and diversity of GM observed during menopause emphasize the pivotal role of estrogen in shaping the gut environment. Estrogen intricately regulates the estrobolome, TJ proteins, mucin, and SCFAs. Via this review, we have tried our best to enlighten on the detailed mechanisms showing the crosslink between estrogen and gut health.

[PMID: 41186249] Biological barriers in our body are dedicated to maintaining systemic homeostasis by enabling selective transport, the dysregulation of which plays a pathogenic role in several diseases. Transendothelial/epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) analysis is conventionally used to assess the barrier permeability. Engineering TEER setups within advanced in vitro models has become essential for acquiring real-time information on barrier integrity inside organ-on-a-chip (OOC) devices. However, current approaches often involve multiple assembly steps, require external access to the culture chamber, rely on cumbersome systems, or provide highly localized measurements that do not represent the entire surface of the tissue under examination. Specifically, in Transwell-based OOC systems, continuous and nondisruptive monitoring is often precluded by the need to disassemble the system for TEER measurement. To address these limitations, we combined conventional technology for patterning thin conductive films with low-cost, benchtop 3D printing to integrate planar electrodes within a Transwell-based hybrid OOC system. Our integrated TEER electrode device, ITE-MINERVA, can be easily employed with commercial measurement instruments, representing a useful tool for real-time, in situ detection of barrier functionality, potentially altered by drug toxicity and absorption processes, on Transwell-based OOCs, both in single- and multiorgan configurations, noninvasively and without stopping the experiment. In this work, we present the design and fabrication strategy of our innovative setup and its assessment in recording real-time TEER modulation on a Caco-2 cell-based in vitro gut epithelial barrier model.",3
Genomic aberrations of metastases provide information for targeted therapy.,genomic aberrations AND metastasis AND targeted therapy AND therapeutic,"40505420,40657395,40439109","[PMID: 40505420] The analysis of tumor DNA by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly utilized for the identification of clinically relevant DNA aberrations. We aim to assess whether WGS improves the guidance of individualized systemic therapy in soft tissue sarcoma (STS). WGS results of STS patients were retrieved from electronic patient records and pathology reports from clinical studies and routine diagnostics. WGS was carried out in primary STS with an unfavorable prognosis, metastatic STS, or STS where broad molecular diagnostics were deemed necessary. Actionable targets were defined as genomic alterations identified by WGS for which specific systemic therapy was indicated in routine care or clinical trials available at time of the WGS analysis. WGS was carried out on 161 STS patients. The most common histological subtypes were leiomyosarcoma (22%), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma/sarcoma not otherwise specified (17%) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (14%). The majority of WGS analyses were requested at the time of recurrence or metastasis (41%), At least one actionable target was found by WGS in 74 (46%) of patients. Actionable targets were more frequently seen for complex genome sarcomas compared with simple genome sarcomas (50% versus 28%). Eventually, 23 patients (14%) received matched experimental therapy based on their WGS results. Non-availability of WGS directed treatment or lack of clinical necessity for systemic therapy (n = 17) and rapid disease progression causing poor performance score (n = 10) were the main reasons to not start WGS-informed therapy. WGS identified actionable targets in 46% of STS cases, leading to WGS-informed therapy in 14% of patients. Improving the timing of the WGS request and a more appropriate patient selection upfront could increase this relatively low percentage. Complex genome sarcomas seem to be the STS group for which WGS is most likely to add value by opening the way to tumor-agnostic therapies.

[PMID: 40657395] ACTL6A, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, has emerged as a critical oncogenic driver across multiple malignancies. Recent studies reveal that aberrant ACTL6A overexpression promotes tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis by orchestrating chromatin remodeling, transcriptional reprogramming, and crosstalk with key signaling pathways (e.g., Hippo/YAP, Notch, and PI3K/AKT). This review systematically synthesizes evidence from <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, and clinical studies spanning hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, glioblastoma, and 10 other cancer types, highlighting ACTL6A's dual role as a chromatin remodeler and an independent oncogenic effector. Key mechanisms include sustaining cancer stemness, suppressing apoptosis, enhancing DNA repair, and driving metabolic reprogramming. Clinically, ACTL6A overexpression correlates with advanced tumor stage, therapy resistance, and poor prognosis, positioning it as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. We further discuss emerging strategies to inhibit ACTL6A (e.g., siRNA, small-molecule inhibitors) and propose combinatorial approaches to overcome drug resistance. By integrating multi-omics data and preclinical models, this review not only clarifies ACTL6A's context-dependent oncogenic networks but also bridges mechanistic insights to translational challenges, offering a roadmap for future research and therapeutic development.

[PMID: 40439109] Pancreatic cancer's aberrant lipid metabolism fuels cell growth, invasion, and metastasis, yet its impact on immune surveillance and immunotherapy is unclear. This study investigated how sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1)-driven lipid metabolism affects the tumor microenvironment (TME) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Clinical significance of SREBP1 was assessed in a PDAC cohort from China and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. The in vitro mechanisms that SREBP1 regulated programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) were investigated using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, Western blotting, luciferase assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. In vivo studies using PDAC-bearing mice, humanized patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models, and autochthonous model of mutation (GEMM-KTC) evaluated the efficacy and mechanisms of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) antibodies and lipid inhibitors. Patients responding to anti-PD-1 therapy exhibited lower serum lipid levels than non-responders. Targeting SREBP1 disrupted lipid metabolism, decelerated tumor growth, and boosted the efficacy of immunotherapy for PDAC. Mechanistically, SREBP1 directly bound the PD-L1 promoter, suppressing its transcription. Meanwhile, PCSK9, a direct transcriptional target of SREBP1, modulated PD-L1 levels via lysosomal degradation. Consequently, the combination of PCSK9-neutralizing antibodies with PD-1 monotherapy showed a robust antitumor effect in both humanized PDX and GEMM-KTC models. The SREBP1-PCSK9 axis-mediated lipid metabolism is crucial for triggering immune evasion and resistance to anti-PD-1. Targeting the SREBP1-PCSK9 axis could potentially reverse PDAC's resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy.",3
Glial calcium waves influence seizures.,glial calcium waves AND seizures AND calcium signaling AND brain activity,"40708193,38614103,37880726","[PMID: 40708193] Neuroinflammation, predominantly associated with glial activation and the release of various inflammatory mediators, is a vital hallmark of the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Numerous studies have indicated that identifying novel factors that diminish neuroinflammatory processes may be important for developing effective therapeutic strategies to prevent neuropathological processes and epileptogenic progression. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) is a highly selective calcium ion channel belonging to the TRPV family. TRPV5 expression has been identified in diverse regions of the brain; however, it remains unknown how TRPV5 is implicated in the pathophysiological features of neurological diseases, including epilepsy. Herein, we show that TRPV5 expression is upregulated in the hippocampus of a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PCSE) model, predominantly in activated microglia. Pharmacological inhibition of TRPV5 using econazole attenuated microglial activation, as indicated by the shift of LPS-stimulated primary hippocampal microglia to a resting state. This inhibition suppressed AKT/NF-κB signaling, reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activity, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production. Additionally, TRPV5 inhibition reduced hippocampal microglial activation and neuroinflammation following PCSE. These findings suggest that TRPV5 contributes to the regulation of microglial activation, resulting in the suppression of microglia-derived neuroinflammation during the sub-acute phase of epilepsy. In conclusion, the present study suggests that targeting TRPV5 may offer a novel therapeutic approach to managing the neuroinflammatory processes during epileptogenic progression.

[PMID: 38614103] Microglial calcium signaling is rare in a baseline state but strongly engaged during early epilepsy development. The mechanism(s) governing microglial calcium signaling are not known. By developing an in vivo uridine diphosphate (UDP) fluorescent sensor, GRAB<sub>UDP1.0</sub>, we discovered that UDP release is a conserved response to seizures and excitotoxicity across brain regions. UDP can signal through the microglial-enriched P2Y<sub>6</sub> receptor to increase calcium activity during epileptogenesis. P2Y<sub>6</sub> calcium activity is associated with lysosome biogenesis and enhanced production of NF-κB-related cytokines. In the hippocampus, knockout of the P2Y<sub>6</sub> receptor prevents microglia from fully engulfing neurons. Attenuating microglial calcium signaling through calcium extruder (""CalEx"") expression recapitulates multiple features of P2Y<sub>6</sub> knockout, including reduced lysosome biogenesis and phagocytic interactions. Ultimately, P2Y<sub>6</sub> knockout mice retain more CA3 neurons and better cognitive task performance during epileptogenesis. Our results demonstrate that P2Y<sub>6</sub> signaling impacts multiple aspects of myeloid cell immune function during epileptogenesis.

[PMID: 37880726] The astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibit morphological and functional diversity in brain region-specific pattern. Functional alterations of reactive astrocytes are commonly present in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) cases, meanwhile the neuroinflammation mediated by reactive astrocytes may advance the development of hippocampal epilepsy in animal models. Nuclear factor I-A (NFIA) may regulate astrocyte diversity in the adult brain. However, whether NFIA endows the astrocytes with regional specificity to be involved in epileptogenesis remains elusive. Here, we utilize an interference RNA targeting NFIA to explore the characteristics of NFIA expression and its role in astrocyte reactivity in a 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced seizure model in vivo and in vitro. Combined with the employment of a HA-tagged plasmid overexpressing NFIA, we further investigate the precise mechanisms how NIFA facilitates epileptogenesis. 4-AP-induced NFIA upregulation in hippocampal region is astrocyte-specific, and primarily promotes detrimental actions of reactive astrocyte. In line with this phenomenon, both NFIA and vanilloid transient receptor potential 4 (TRPV4) are upregulated in hippocampal astrocytes in human samples from the TLE surgical patients and mouse samples with intraperitoneal 4-AP. NFIA directly regulates mouse astrocytic TRPV4 expression while the quantity and the functional activity of TRPV4 are required for 4-AP-induced astrocyte reactivity and release of proinflammatory cytokines in the charge of NFIA upregulation. NFIA deficiency efficiently inhibits 4-AP-induced TRPV4 upregulation, weakens astrocytic calcium activity and specific astrocyte reactivity, thereby mitigating aberrant neuronal discharges and neuronal damage, and suppressing epileptic seizure. Our results uncover the critical role of NFIA in astrocyte reactivity and illustrate how epileptogenic brain injury initiates cell-specific signaling pathway to dictate the astrocyte responses.",3
Gpr124 suppresses BBB breakdown in mouse models of ischemic stroke.,GPR124 AND Blood-Brain Barrier AND ischemic stroke AND mouse models,28288111,"[PMID: 28288111] Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise is central to the etiology of diverse central nervous system (CNS) disorders, endothelial receptor proteins that control BBB function are poorly defined. The endothelial G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr124 has been reported to be required for normal forebrain angiogenesis and BBB function in mouse embryos, but the role of this receptor in adult animals is unknown. Here Gpr124 conditional knockout (CKO) in the endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity, but resulted in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic stroke and glioblastoma, accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Constitutive activation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice, with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction, pericyte coverage and extracellular-matrix deficits. We thus identify Gpr124 as an endothelial GPCR specifically required for endothelial Wnt signaling and BBB integrity under pathological conditions in adult mice. This finding implicates Gpr124 as a potential therapeutic target for human CNS disorders characterized by BBB disruption.",1

In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), Ang II and TNFα activate Nox1 (NADPH oxidase 1) to produce superoxide. TNFα receptors associate with Nox1 and LRRC8A (leucine-rich repeat containing 8A) anion channels to modulate inflammation and contractility in a RhoA-dependent manner. VSMC-specific LRRC8A knockout mesenteric arteries are protected from TNFα-induced injury, and vasodilation is preserved. We hypothesized that LRRC8A knockout would preserve vascular function and decrease blood pressure (BP) in Ang II-infused mice. Wild-type and knockout mice received Ang II infusions for 14 days. BP was measured by radiotelemetry, and aortic and mesenteric artery function was measured by wire myography. VSMCs were isolated from male wild-type and knockout mice. Systolic BP was not different, but knockout mice had more BP dipping during inactive periods at baseline, and dipping was preserved after Ang II. The function of knockout aortic and mesenteric vessels was less impaired by Ang II, as reflected by less augmented contraction to norepinephrine and serotonin and preserved relaxation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Western blotting revealed increased soluble guanylate cyclase alpha and reduced CPI-17 in hypertensive knockout aortae. Consistent with lower Rho kinase activity, phosphorylation of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) and cofilin was reduced in knockout VSMCs. Ang II caused less proliferation (lower PCNA [proliferating cell nuclear antigen]) and less induction of senescence in knockout vessels. LRRC8A anion channels support VSMC inflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction, which impairs BP dipping in hypertension.

[PMID: 41181726] This article introduces Myopraktikk (NO), a Norwegian-developed manual treatment method, where we clinically observe by palpation and visual inspection immediate local and remote responses that form the basis for a new hypothesis uniting intrafasciomembranal fluid pressure (IFMFP), Myopraktikk treatment chains, and the principle of biotensegrity in a single framework. Here, IFMFP refers to fluid pressure within fascial compartments, treatment chains describe functional pathways of force and tension that appear to respond collectively to local input, and biotensegrity denotes mechanical balance in an interconnected network. Muscle pain and myalgias are among the most common causes of pain and functional impairment, yet current models remain fragmented and leave major gaps. Why does nonspecific pain and stiffness arise without structural findings? Why do muscles feel ""tight"" at rest, and why do some tensions resolve quickly while others persist? What are muscle knots, trigger points (TrP), and fascial restrictions in regional pain conditions, and how might they connect to fibromyalgia (FM), overtraining syndrome (OTS), myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or even everyday complaints such as morning stiffness and weather-related pain? The IFMFP model postulates fluid accumulation and pressure rise within fascial spaces surrounding muscle fibers, bundles, and whole muscles, driven by overuse and impaired drainage, and conceptually comparable to intramuscular compartment pressure. This pressure alone might shorten and thicken tissue, and induce venous stasis, hypoxia, pH reduction, hyaluronan (HA) modification, and altered membrane permeability. Unlike traditional theories that see HA changes as causal, the IFMFP model proposes the reverse: pressure drives HA alterations and densification, enabling chronic dysfunction. A key clinical observation is that, by palpation and visual inspection, knots, TrP, tensions, and fascial cords are often felt to diminish during treatment, both locally and remotely, with patients and practitioners reporting perceived immediate changes in asymmetry, tonus, and stiffness. These findings suggest such structures are not static lesions but dynamic fluid pockets of increased IFMFP, dissolving as pressure is released. Based on clinical observations, the Myopraktikk treatment chains reveal patterns of movement, force, and tension, where local interventions may influence the entire chain through systemic equalization, in line with biotensegrity. By integrating biomechanical, physiological, and psychosocial factors, IFMFP offers a unifying mechanism that may link diverse myalgias within an expanded framework of myofascial pain syndrome. Myopraktikk therefore challenges established assumptions both as a treatment method and as a conceptual framework, where immediate, systemic, and reversible changes in myofascial tension, amplified by the physical expression of stress and thought, provide a fresh understanding of myalgias.

[PMID: 41181068] The cultural policies of Mainland China have been subject to fascinating changes in the last forty years, influenced by politics and ideology on the one hand, and market forces on the other. The article provides a preliminary outline of the main traits of the system, analysed from the perspective of contemporary cultural policies theory and international practice. The authors examine how the cultural sector of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is organized and financed, including its governance, funding, copyright, basic cultural providers and consumers. The methodological approach used adopts the analytical framework of the Compendium of Cultural Policies & Trends, and includes analyses of statistical data, primary and secondary sources. Data and source information show that cultural policies of the PRC are a function of central-level political policy-making of the party-state. Cultural activity at all levels is subject to strong political control. At the same time, there is visible tension between central-level general policy guidelines and local level implementation, and between the mission of the state to ensure wide cultural participation, and the market economy incentivization of public cultural organizations. The authors conclude that the sector exhibits a dual characteristics, with market-insulated public services on the one side, and the market economy Cultural and Creative Sectors (CCS) on the other, where state-owned enterprises compete for services, customers, and profits with private entities. Faced with numerous challenges and new developments, the sector also witnesses dynamic changes of its legal environment.",3
H.pylori-mediated gastric cancer occurs due to the accumulation of mutations in host epithelial cells.,H. pylori AND gastric cancer AND epithelial cell mutations AND genetic mutations,"38231221,33989515,39129877","[PMID: 38231221] Helicobacter pylori CagA is the first and only bacterial oncoprotein etiologically associated with human cancer. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells via bacterial type IV secretion, CagA acts as a pathogenic/pro-oncogenic scaffold that interacts with and functionally perturbs multiple host proteins such as pro-oncogenic SHP2 phosphatase and polarity-regulating kinase PAR1b/MARK2. Although H. pylori infection is established during early childhood, gastric cancer generally develops in elderly individuals, indicating that oncogenic CagA activity is effectively counteracted at a younger age. Moreover, the eradication of cagA-positive H. pylori cannot cure established gastric cancer, indicating that H. pylori CagA-triggered gastric carcinogenesis proceeds via a hit-and-run mechanism. In addition to its direct oncogenic action, CagA induces BRCAness, a cellular status characterized by replication fork destabilization and loss of error-free homologous recombination-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by inhibiting cytoplasmic-to-nuclear localization of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor. This causes genomic instability that leads to the accumulation of excess mutations in the host cell genome, which may underlie hit-and-run gastric carcinogenesis. The close connection between CagA and BRCAness was corroborated by a recent large-scale case-control study that revealed that the risk of gastric cancer in individuals carrying pathogenic variants of genes that induce BRCAness (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2) dramatically increases upon infection with cagA-positive H. pylori. Accordingly, CagA-mediated BRCAness plays a crucial role in the development of gastric cancer in conjunction with the direct oncogenic action of CagA.

[PMID: 33989515] Infection with CagA-producing Helicobacter pylori plays a causative role in the development of gastric cancer. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells, CagA deregulates prooncogenic phosphatase SHP2 while inhibiting polarity-regulating kinase PAR1b through complex formation. Here, we show that CagA/PAR1b interaction subverts nuclear translocation of BRCA1 by inhibiting PAR1b-mediated BRCA1 phosphorylation. It hereby induces BRCAness that promotes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) while disabling error-free homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. The CagA/PAR1b interaction also stimulates Hippo signaling that circumvents apoptosis of DNA-damaged cells, giving cells time to repair DSBs through error-prone mechanisms. The DSB-activated p53-p21<sup>Cip1</sup> axis inhibits proliferation of CagA-delivered cells, but the inhibition can be overcome by p53 inactivation. Indeed, sequential pulses of CagA in TP53-mutant cells drove somatic mutation with BRCAness-associated genetic signatures. Expansion of CagA-delivered cells with BRCAness-mediated genome instability, from which CagA-independent cancer-predisposing cells arise, provides a plausible ""hit-and-run mechanism"" of H. pylori CagA for gastric carcinogenesis.

[PMID: 39129877] Although <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is the most important bacterial carcinogen in gastric cancer (GC), GC can emerge even after <i>H. pylori</i> eradication. Studies suggest that various constituents of the gastric microbiome may influence GC development, but the role of individual pathogens is unclear. Human gastric mucosal samples were analyzed by 16SrRNA sequencing to investigate microbiome composition and its association with clinical parameters, including GC risk. Identified bacteria in the stomach were cocultured with gastric epithelial cells or inoculated into mice, and transcriptomic changes, DNA damage, and inflammation were analyzed. Bacterial reads in GC tissues were examined together with transcriptomic and genetic sequencing data in the cancer genome atlas dataset. Patients after <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> eradication formed 3 subgroups based on the microbial composition revealed by 16SrRNA sequencing. One dysbiotic group enriched with <i>Fusobacterium</i> and <i>Neisseria</i> species was associated with a significantly higher GC incidence. These species activated prooncogenic pathways in gastric epithelial cells and promoted inflammation in mouse stomachs. Sugar chains that constitute gastric mucin attenuate host-bacteria interactions. Metabolites from <i>Fusobacterium</i> species were genotoxic, and the presence of the bacteria was associated with an inflammatory signature and a higher tumor mutation burden. Gastric microbiota in the dysbiotic stomach is associated with GC development after <i>H. pylori</i> eradication and plays a pathogenic role through direct host-bacteria interaction.",3
HAND2 methylation is a key step in early endometrial carcinogenesis.,HAND2 methylation AND endometrial carcinogenesis AND epigenetic regulation AND early cancer development,"41187371,41187221,41186927","[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41186927] Sirtuins have gained significant prominence in scientific research due to their involvement in a wide array of biological processes, including DNA repair, genome stability, transcription modulation, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of their function has been implicated in various pathologies, including cancer, where sirtuins exhibit context-dependent effects. Consequently, the development of sirtuin inhibitors and activators remains an exceptionally important field of research, focusing on the design of selective modulators targeting individual sirtuin isoforms. This review includes the patents regarding sirtuin modulators released from 2020 to 2024 and provides a concise overview of the most relevant modulators developed so far. Relevant patents were systematically identified through comprehensive searches in PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), Google Patents (https://patents.google.com), and Espacenet (https://worldwide.espacenet.com). Sirtuin modulators are pivotal in addressing aging, metabolism, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Sirtuins regulate key cellular processes like DNA repair, genome stability, and mitochondrial function. Activators show promise in mitigating many age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and neurodegeneration. Inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in oncology and neurodegenerative conditions. Advances in PROTAC technology enable selective degradation of specific isoforms, enhancing therapeutic precision. With progress in drug design and high-throughput screening, sirtuin modulators hold immense potential to revolutionize treatments for complex medical challenges.",3
Having a main partner improves HIV outcomes.,main partner AND HIV outcomes AND relationship impact AND sexual relationship,"33927009,39345026,36194890","[PMID: 33927009] To develop a classification of sexual partner types for use in partner notification (PN) for STIs. A four-step process: (1) an iterative synthesis of five sources of evidence: scoping review of social and health sciences literature on partner types; analysis of relationship types in dating apps; systematic review of PN intervention content; and review of PN guidelines; qualitative interviews with public, patients and health professionals to generate an initial comprehensive classification; (2) multidisciplinary clinical expert consultation to revise the classification; (3) piloting of the revised classification in sexual health clinics during a randomised controlled trial of PN; (4) application of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify index patients' willingness to engage in PN for each partner type. Five main partner types emerged from the evidence synthesis and consultation: 'established partner', 'new partner', 'occasional partner', 'one-off partner' and 'sex worker'. The types differed across several dimensions, including likely perceptions of sexual exclusivity, likelihood of sex reoccurring between index patient and sex partner. Sexual health professionals found the classification easy to operationalise. During the trial, they assigned all 3288 partners described by 2223 index patients to a category. The TDF analysis suggested that the partner types might be associated with different risks of STI reinfection, onward transmission and index patients' engagement with PN. We developed an evidence-informed, useable classification of five sexual partner types to underpin PN practice and other STI prevention interventions. Analysis of biomedical, psychological and social factors that distinguish different partner types shows how each could warrant a tailored PN approach. This classification could facilitate the use of partner-centred outcomes. Additional studies are needed to determine the utility of the classification to improve measurement of the impact of PN strategies and help focus resources.

[PMID: 39345026] Uganda is burdened by high unintended and teen pregnancies, high sexually transmitted infections, and harm caused by unsafe abortion. Explore factors influencing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in Uganda by synthesizing evidence from qualitative studies using a scoping review. Original qualitative peer-reviewed research studies published between 2002 and 2023 in any language exploring factors influencing SRHR in Uganda. Eight databases searched using qualitative/mixed methods search filters and no language limits. Information extracted included author, article title, publication year, study aims, participant description, data collection type, sample size, main findings, factors at the individual, interpersonal, community, and policy levels, implications for SRHR in Uganda, and study limitations. Quality of the selected articles was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. One hundred seventy-three studies met inclusion criteria. At the individual level, knowledge and attitudes toward SRHR, risky sexual behavior, and access to maternal SRHR services were identified as critical factors influencing health outcomes. Interpersonal factors included communication with sexual partners and relationships with family, school, and community members. Healthcare organization factors included adolescent access to education, SRHR services, and HIV prevention. Cultural and social factors included gendered norms and male involvement in SRHR. Policy-level factors included the importance of aligning policy and practice. Multiple factors at individual, interpersonal, community, healthcare, cultural, and policy levels were found to influence SRHR in Uganda. The findings suggest that interventions targeting multiple levels of the socio-ecological system may be necessary to improve SRHR outcomes. This review highlights the need for a holistic approach that considers the broader socio-ecological context. Reducing identified gaps in the literature, particularly between policy and practice related to SRHR, is urgently needed in Uganda. We hope this review will inform the development of policies and interventions to improve SRHR outcomes.

[PMID: 36194890] It is well-established that experiencing sexual abuse and violence can have a range of detrimental impacts; a wide variety of interventions exist to support survivors in the aftermath. Understanding the experiences and perspectives of survivors receiving such interventions, along with those of their family members, and the professionals who deliver them is important for informing decision making as to what to offer survivors, for developing new interventions, and enhancing their acceptability. This review sought to: 1. identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring the experiences of child and adult survivors of sexual abuse and violence, and their caregivers, regarding psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting survivors and preventing negative health outcomes in terms of benefits, risks/harms and barriers; 2. identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring the experiences of professionals who deliver psychosocial interventions for sexual abuse and violence in terms of perceived benefits, risks/harms and barriers for survivors and their families/caregivers; 3. develop a conceptual understanding of how different factors influence uptake, dropout or completion, and outcomes from psychosocial interventions for sexual abuse and violence; 4. develop a conceptual understanding of how features and types of interventions responded to the needs of different user/survivor groups (e.g. age groups; types of abuse exposure; migrant populations) and contexts (healthcare/therapeutic settings; low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)); 5. explore how the findings of this review can enhance our understanding of the findings from the linked and related reviews assessing the effectiveness of interventions aimed at supporting survivors and preventing negative health outcomes. In August 2021 we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and nine other databases. We also searched for unpublished reports and qualitative reports of quantitative studies in a linked systematic review, together with reference checking, citation searches and contacting authors and other researchers to identify relevant studies. We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies (with an identifiable qualitative component) that were linked to a psychosocial intervention aimed at supporting survivors of sexual abuse and violence. Eligible studies focused on at least one of three participant groups: survivors of any age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity or [dis]ability who had received a psychosocial intervention; their carers, family members or partners; and professionals delivering such interventions. We placed no restrictions in respect of settings, locations, intervention delivery formats or durations. Six review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified. We extracted data using a form designed for this synthesis, then used this information and an appraisal of data richness and quality in order to stratify the studies using a maximum variation approach. We assessed the methodological limitations using the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We coded directly onto the sampled papers using NVivo and synthesised data using a thematic synthesis methodology and used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We used a narrative synthesis and matrix model to integrate our qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) findings with those of intervention review findings. We identified 97 eligible studies and sampled 37 of them for our analysis. Most sampled studies were from high-income countries, with four from middle-income and two from low-income countries. In 27 sampled studies, the participants were survivors, in three they were intervention facilitators. Two included all three of our stakeholder groups, and five included two of our groups. The studies explored a wide range of psychosocial interventions, with only one type of intervention explored in more than one study. The review indicates that features associated with the context in which interventions were delivered had an impact on how individuals accessed and experienced interventions. This included organisational features, such as staff turnover, that could influence survivors' engagement with interventions; the setting or location in which interventions were delivered; and the characteristics associated with who delivered the interventions. Studies that assess the effectiveness of interventions typically assess their impact on mental health; however, as well as finding benefits to mental health, our QES found that study participants felt interventions also had positive impacts on their physical health, mood, understanding of trauma, interpersonal relationships and enabled them to re-engage with a wide range of areas in their lives. Participants explained that features of interventions and their contexts that best enabled them to benefit from interventions were also often things that could be a barrier to benefiting from interventions. For example, the relationship with the therapist, when open and warm was a benefit, but if such a relationship could not be achieved, it was a barrier. Survivors' levels of readiness and preparedness to both start and end interventions could have positive (if they were ready) or negative (if they were not) impacts. Study participants identified the potential risks and harms associated with completing interventions but felt that it was important to face and process trauma. Some elements of interventions were specific to the intervention type (e.g. faith-based interventions), or related to an experience of an intervention that held particular relevance to subgroups of survivors (e.g. minority groups); these issues could impact how individuals experienced delivering or receiving interventions. We had high or moderate confidence in all but one of our review findings. Further research in low- and middle-income settings, with male survivors of sexual abuse and violence and those from minority groups could strengthen the evidence for low and moderate confidence findings. We found that few interventions had published quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Since this QES has highlighted important aspects that could enable interventions to be more suitable for survivors, using a range of methodologies would provide valuable information that could enhance intervention uptake, completion and effectiveness. This study has shown that although survivors often found interventions difficult, they also appreciated that they needed to work through trauma, which they said resulted in a wide range of benefits. Therefore, listening to survivors and providing appropriate interventions, at the right time for them, can make a significant difference to their health and well-being.",3
Helicobacter pylori-induced aberrant NF-kB-dependent expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase contributes to the mutagenesis of host DNA.,Helicobacter pylori AND NF-kB-dependent AND AID expression AND host DNA mutagenesis,"41187167,41183072,41182092","[PMID: 41187167] Pepsinogen (PG) and gastrin-17 (G-17) are widely used in the screening of gastric diseases. Our cross-sectional clinical study investigates the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, sex, and age on serum levels of PG and G-17 in asymptomatic subjects in Rizhao, China. A total of 12,746 asymptomatic subjects were enrolled in the study between August 2023 and January 2024. Serum levels of pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII), and G-17 were measured using the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method, and the PGI/PGII ratio (PGR) was calculated. HP infection was detected using the Colloidal Gold Method, and the relationship between age, sex, HP infection, and serum PG and G-17 levels was analyzed. HP prevalence was 19.33% in this study. The serum PGI, PGII, and G-17 levels were significantly higher in the HP-positive group compared to the HP-negative group (P < 0.001), whereas the PGR was notably lower in the HP-positive group (P < 0.001). Spearman correlation tests analysis indicated a positive correlation between HP infection and PGI, PGII, and G-17 (r = 0.144, P < 0.001; r = 0.418, P < 0.001; r = 0.268, P < 0.001), and a negative correlation with PGR (r = -0.438, P < 0.001). ROC curve shows that the AUC of the combination of PGI, PGII, PGR, and G-17 in diagnosing HP positive were 0.605 (95% CI: 0.592-0.618), 0.805 (95% CI: 0.795-0.816), 0.820 (95% CI: 0.811-0.830), and 0.709 (95% CI: 0.698-0.720), respectively. The detection rates of abnormal PG and G-17 levels were significantly higher in the HP-positive group than in the HP-negative group (P < 0.01). Males exhibited significantly higher levels of both PGI and PGII than females (P < 0.001). The G-17 levels were higher in males than females in the 50-59 age group (P < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that serum levels of both PGI and PGII exhibited an increase with age. Serum PGI, PGII, and G-17 levels were positively correlated with age, although the relationship was weak (r = 0.228, P < 0.001; r = 0.246, P < 0.001; r = 0.042, P < 0.001). Following adjustment for sex and Helicobacter pylori infection covariates using a restricted cubic spline (RCS), the analysis revealed a significant overall association between PGI, PGII, PGR, and G-17 serum levels and age (P for overall < 0.001, P for overall < 0.001, P for overall = 0.003, and P for overall < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship was found between PGI, PGR, and G-17 levels and age (nonlinear P = 0.004, nonlinear P = 0.001, and nonlinear P = 0.008, respectively), whereas PGII exhibited a linear correlation (nonlinear P = 0.841). Serum levels of PG and G-17 are associated with HP infection, sex, and age. These findings provide region-specific insights into the relationships between these biomarkers and HP infection, highlighting the importance of considering HP infection status, sex, and age in future research.

[PMID: 41183072] Chronic infections such as Helicobacter pylori (Hp), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) significantly contribute to the global cancer burden, necessitating targeted and cost-effective prevention strategies. The Cancer Prevention at Work (CPW) project pioneers an innovative approach by integrating primary prevention interventions into occupational health surveillance (OHS) programs, thus leveraging existing workplace infrastructure for a large-scale impact. CPW aims to screen and treat Hp and HCV infections, and promote HPV vaccination, targeting not only workers but also their household members. CPW aims to support accessibility, facilitate earlier detection, and strengthen cancer prevention at a population level. The project employs a micro-elimination strategy for HCV, supports data-driven risk assessment for Hp and HPV, and promotes evidence-based communication to reduce HPV vaccine hesitancy. A comprehensive data management framework ensures harmonized data collection, integration, and cost-effectiveness analysis, aiming at providing robust evidence for policy recommendations. Through pilot studies conducted across four European countries, CPW assesses the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and economic sustainability, with the potential to inform future occupational cancer prevention initiatives across Europe. This work summarizes the CPW project's research framework designed to integrate infection-related cancer prevention into workplace health programs across Europe. It details the project's goals, methods, and discusses the impact on occupational cancer prevention.

[PMID: 41182092] Gastric cancer (GC) continues to pose a significant global health burden with persistent diagnostic challenges, especially in the detection of early-stage GC. Herein, a strand displacement reaction-mediated nucleic acid amplifier based on the spatial confinement (SC-SDR) effect as a ""booster"" is constructed to detect extracellular vesicle-derived microRNAs (EVs-miRNAs). Constraining the reactant and fuel strands in a limited space using a T-shaped DNA structure results in a significant improvement in the reaction kinetics and sensitivity because of the high local strand concentrations, ultimately enabling the detection of EVs-miRNAs at the femtomolar level. SC-SDR is conjugated onto a hydrophobic tether to aid delivery into EVs, allowing for the <i>in situ</i> detection of EVs-miRNAs. Four EVs-miRNAs act as biomarkers in combination with a random forest (RF) algorithm for use in GC diagnostics, prognostics, and early warning. In a cohort of 58 patients with GC, this diagnostic model effectively identifies 51 of the 58 cases, showing a satisfactory accuracy of 87.93%. This diagnostic efficiency outperforms that of conventional biomarkers (CEA and CA19-9), which exhibit accuracies of only 25.86% (15/58) and 17.24% (10/58), respectively. The longitudinal analysis of EVs-miRNA expression in GC patients before and after surgery and in patients with gastric intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN) reveals the dual utility of this approach as both a robust prognostic biomarker for GC progression and a promising predictive marker for GIN development. Overall, this study highlights the combined power of SC-SDR and machine learning for the analysis of EVs-miRNAs, paving the way for the clinical diagnosis and prognostication of GC.",3
Helminths interfere with immune system control of coinfections by microbial pathogens 16.,helminth infection AND immune regulation AND coinfection AND microbial pathogen,"41187217,19478853,41187352","[PMID: 41187217] Trichuris trichiura, a soil-transmitted helminth (STH), infection is highly prevalent in children and, if not treated, can cause adverse health consequences. Microscopy using the Kato-Katz method is the mainstay of STH diagnosis in most settings but has low sensitivity. This study aims to quantify prevalence and examine risk factors of trichuriasis among children in a malaria-endemic area. The study recruited 181 children aged <5 years old from a household survey conducted in 16 villages in Timika, Papua, Indonesia, from April to July 2013. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and stool samples were analysed later using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The prevalence of T. trichiura infections was 13.8% (25/181; 95%CI, 9.1-19.7) by Kato-Katz microscopy examination and 31.5% (57/181; 95%CI, 24.8-38.8) by qPCR analysis, increasing the prevalence by 17.7% (p = 0.0001). Children aged >3 years old had a 3 times increased risk of having trichuriasis compared to younger ones (aOR 3.29 [95%CI, 1.42-7.63], p = 0.006). Children with Hb ≤ 10 g/dL were 2 times more likely to have trichuriasis compared to those with Hb > 10 g/dL, (OR 2.46 [95%CI, 1.14-5.31], p = 0.020). Malaria prevalence was 9.9% (18/181; 95%CI, 6-15.3). Coinfections with malaria increased the risk of anaemia (OR 11.7 [95%CI, 2.0-67.0], p = 0.004. No apparent association was found between trichuriasis and undernutrition (wasting and stunting). The prevalence of trichuriasis in under-five children is underestimated and together with malaria, the infections are associated with anaemia. Public health strategy should include STH prevention targeted to young children living in malaria-endemic areas.

[PMID: 19478853] The nature of the immune response to infection is dependent on the type of infecting organism. Intracellular organisms such as Toxoplasma gondii stimulate a Th1-driven response associated with production of IL-12, IFN-gamma, nitric oxide and IgG2a antibodies and classical activation of macrophages. In contrast, extracellular helminths such as Fasciola hepatica induce Th2 responses characterised by the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IgG1 antibodies and alternative activation of macrophages. As co-infections with these types of parasites commonly exist in the field it is relevant to examine how the various facets of the immune responses induced by each may influence or counter-regulate that of the other. Regardless, of whether F. hepatica infection preceded or succeeded T. gondii infection, there was little impact on the production of the Th1 cytokines IL-12, IFN-gamma or on the development of classically-activated macrophages induced by T. gondii. By contrast, the production of helminth-specific Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-5, was suppressed by infection with T. gondii. Additionally, the recruitment and alternative activation of macrophages by F. hepatica was blocked or reversed by subsequent infection with T. gondii. The clinical symptoms of toxoplasmosis and the survival rate of infected mice were not significantly altered by the helminth. Despite previous studies showing that F. hepatica suppressed the classical activation of macrophages and the Th1-driven responses of mice to bystander microbial infection, as well as reduced their ability to reject these, here we found that the potent immune responses to T. gondii were capable of suppressing the responses to helminth infection. Clearly, the outcome of particular infections in polyparasitoses depends on the means and potency by which each pathogen controls the immune response.

In this study, we showed that emitted VOCs discriminate between uncontaminated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and those contaminated with the bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis or fungus Aspergillus Fumigatus separately, in vitro, using a methodology based on an adapted cell culture and thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). In addition, we elucidated a set of discriminatory volatile compounds from the MSC cultures and media alone across a time series experiment. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-variable importance in projection confirmed putative identifications of 18, 16, and 26 VOCs that showed relevant changes in a bacterial, fungal, and universal pathogen model, respectively, with an accuracy of 100% in the fungal model. Among these metabolites, octane, 2,5,6-trimethyl- overlapped between the three groups. Furthermore, a total of 15 VOCs were found most relevant to cell culture expansion over three days based on cluster analysis. This novel study goes a step further in identifying distinct VOC signatures of MSCs contaminated with S. epidermidis or A. fumigatus, and in monitoring MSCs proliferation over time. This pilot study shows preliminary results that indicate that VOC headspace analysis could serve as a suitable, rapid, non-invasive, and non-destructive tool for the metabolic and growth monitoring of MSCs in a dynamic cell culture bioreactor system.",3

They effectively cover the key elements: C-reactive protein AND chronic obstructive pulmonary disease AND exacerbation AND and inflammation.,"41187293,41187245,41187302","[PMID: 41187293] Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fatal disease. Current clinically approved treatments slow disease progression but are not curative. Thus, there is a critical need to better define the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF and develop novel approaches to treat this devastating lung condition. Immune dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, accompanied by fibrosis, constitutes a key hallmark of IPF. IPF is generally considered to be a fibroproliferative disorder rather than an immune condition because, historically, immunomodulatory therapies have failed to produce significant clinical effect. This lack of response is frustrating given that there is evidence of immune dysfunction in IPF and highlights the need to clarify the role of immune cells and inflammatory pathways in IPF. There is increasing evidence that the extracellular matrix (ECM) directs cell fate and function, and we propose that ECM remodeling and immune dysfunction in IPF generate a self-perpetuating fibrotic circuit that is refractory to classical anti-inflammatory agents. Understanding the relationship between ECM and immune dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis could help identify novel therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease.

[PMID: 41187245] Identifying the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a cornerstone of preventive medical care. Despite its significance, limited research has explored ASCVD risk in individuals with fibrotic skin diseases. This study aims to evaluate the risk of ASCVD in patients diagnosed with fibrotic skin conditions. We utilized the TriNetX platform to analyze ASCVD risk associated with fibrotic skin conditions. Propensity score-matched (PSM) cohorts were constructed to adjust for confounding. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Patients with fibrotic skin diseases demonstrated an elevated risk of ASCVD. Scleroderma was most strongly associated with ASCVD risk (HR 2.51 [95% CI: 1.97,3.21]), followed by hypertrophic scar (HR 1.40 [95% CI: 1.20,1.63]). Elevated risks were also observed for morphea (HR 1.36 [95% CI: 1.03,1.08]) and lichen sclerosis (HR 1.30 [95% CI: 1.04,1.62]). Individuals with fibrotic skin conditions, including scleroderma, hypertrophic scars, morphea, and lichen sclerosis, demonstrate an increased risk of ASCVD. These findings highlight the significance of recognizing fibrotic skin diseases as possible indicators of systemic inflammation.

[PMID: 41187302] Major adverse cardiovascular events resulting from atherosclerotic plaque instability account for a plurality of deaths worldwide despite the use of highly effective lipid lowering therapies. Over the last three decades, the role of inflammation in atherogenesis has been tested extensively. Although preclinical studies demonstrate a clear role for inflammation in atherogenesis, clinical studies using global anti-inflammatory therapies have not been as successful as hoped, encouraging the search for new therapeutic strategies. Thanks to the advent of cell-specific lineage tracing, we have begun to appreciate the multifaceted role of smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching in modulating plaque stability. Here, we review the mechanisms controlling smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching during early and late-stage pathogenesis, which may inspire future therapies to stabilize plaques.",3

Although most biosecurity information is aimed and created for larger producers and isn't appropriate for smaller producers, such as swine exhibitors. Swine exhibitors are a niche group who raise swine differently than large producers and travel extensively with their animals. This study sought out to; develop a SPS plan template adapted from the SPS framework that would be suitable for swine exhibitors' biosecurity features; describe basic demographics and existence of biosecurity plan (and their features) for the target population; and investigate the association between having a previous biosecurity plan on site and demographic factors (number of pigs, type of housing, presence of other animal species in the premise and geographical region) as well as potential exposure to feral swine under their current housing conditions. These objectives were accomplished by attending twelve swine exhibitions within a year and a half to assist 161 individuals in the creation of personalized biosecurity plans for their premises, while obtaining additional study data. This study found no significant relationship between demographic factors and previously having a biosecurity plan, but that only 31.8 % of participants had previous biosecurity plans on their premise. However, swine exhibitors with existing biosecurity plans had more than 3-fold higher odds of acknowledging housing conditions with potential of feral swine contact compared to swine exhibitors without preexisting biosecurity plans. These findings indicate the need for additional efforts to assist swine exhibitors in creating biosecurity plans at shows across the United States.

[PMID: 41187385] First-generation Latinx immigrant youth face risks for experiencing unique immigration-related traumas, which could exacerbate their mental health. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of forced immigration-related family separation on the association between traditional adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) among Latinx immigrant youth from the Northern Triangle (NT; El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Primary surveys assessing forced immigration-related family separation, ACEs, and mental health were administered to a sample of NT immigrant youth (N = 172). Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the study aim. In main effects analysis, forced immigration-related family separation was significantly associated with depression (B = 2.11, CI = [0.11, 4.11], p = .039) and PTSD (B = 4.01, CI = [0.63, 7.40], p = .021) symptoms. ACEs were significantly associated with depression (B = 1.34, CI = [0.86, 1.81], p < .001), anxiety (B = 1.05, CI = [0.63, 1.47], p < .001), and PTSD (B = 2.17, CI = [1.37, 2.97], p < .001) symptoms. In moderation effects analysis, the association of ACEs on depression (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.18, -0.25], p = .014), anxiety (B = -1.00, CI = [-1.86, -0.13], p = .024), and PTSD (B = -2.23, CI = [-3.84, -0.62], p = .007) symptoms was significantly attenuated among youth who experienced forced immigration-related family separation. Study findings may underscore the need to consider the inclusivity of immigration-related trauma in ACE assessment tools.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.",3

Mice in the model group were intraperitoneally injected with normal saline. The UBC13 group was administered UBC13 recombinant protein, and the dexamethasone (DXM) group was treated with DXM for 8 weeks. Serum anti-dsDNA and ANA levels were quantified via ELISA. Histopathological changes were analyzed using H&E staining. Splenic mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Flow cytometry was used characterize Th1, Th2 and Treg cells populations, while western blotting was used to detect STAT3 and NF-κB signalling pathway-related proteins in thymic lysates. UBC13 administration ameliorated splenic hyperplasia and attenuated tissue damage in MRL/lpr mice, accompanied by a reduction in serum anti-dsDNA and ANA titers. Proinflammatory cytokine production, was suppressed following UBC13 intervention. Concurrently, UBC13 restored Th1/Th2 cell equilibrium and enhanced Treg cell suppressive function. Mechanistically, UBC13 inhibited NF-κB pathway activation and suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation. UBC13 restores the homeostasis and function of Th1/Th2 and Treg cell through suppression of STAT3 and the NF-κB signaling pathway activation, thereby mitigating SLE-induced organ damage.

[PMID: 31394431] Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS)-interacting multifunctional protein 1 (AIMP1) enhances the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In our previous study, we have shown that serum AIMP1 in patients with SLE was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. To address whether neutralization of AIMP1 could ameliorate nephritis in lupus-prone mice, we generated atializumab, a humanized antibody against AIMP1 and investigated its therapeutic efficacy. ELISA showed that serum AIMP1 at 23 weeks old was significantly higher than that at 13 weeks old in lupus-prone mice. Therefore, lupus-prone mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups (vehicle, methylprednisolone and 0.5, 2, and 5 mg/kg atializumab). After treatment, disease severity was assessed using a variety of phenotypes, including proteinuria, histological damages, renal deposition of immune-complex. In addition, serum cytokines, anti-dsDNA and IgG subclasses were determined. T cell subsets were analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Atializumab significantly diminished proteinuria, improved glomerular and tubular damages and reduced the renal deposition of immune-complexes. Moreover, atializumab significantly decreased serum interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-17A, and IL-6, whereas it increased serum IL-10. Similarly, atializumab reduced the numbers of T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2 and T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in a dose-dependent manner, while atializumab enhanced the number of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Furthermore, atializumab decreased not only splenic plasma cells and serum anti-dsDNA but also pathogenic IgG subclasses for nephritis. It suppressed NF-κB activation by inhibiting IκBα degradation in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Atializumab alleviated nephritis by inhibiting autoreactive T, B, and plasma cells and decreasing NF-κB-related proinflammatory cytokines in lupus-prone mice. These results suggest that treatment targeting AIMP1 could be a novel and highly immune-modulating therapeutic strategy in lupus nephritis.

[PMID: 30894863] <b>Introduction:</b> The role of the immune response in the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) remains elusive. It is possible that differences in the frequencies of Th17 cells and/or defects in the immunoregulatory mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of APS. Our aim was to determine the peripheral blood Th cells phenotype and the circulating cytokine profile in patients with primary APS (pAPS) and compare it with systemic lupus erythemathosus (SLE) as disease control group. <b>Methods:</b> The frequencies of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) were determined in PBMCs from 36 patients with pAPS by flow cytometry. As control groups we included 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) and 11 patients with SLE. The suppressive capacity of Tregs was evaluated <i>in vitro</i> by coculture assay. On the other hand, intracellular cytokine production was assessed in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and circulating IL-6, IL-10, and IL-35 were measured by Cytometric Bead Array and ELISA. The quantification of Th master gene expression levels was performed by real time quantitative PCR. <b>Results:</b> pAPS patients and SLE patients did not show differences in the percentage or number of Tregs compared to HC. The suppressive capacity of Tregs was also similar in the three study group. Instead, we found higher FoxP3·mRNA expression levels in pAPS patients and HC than SLE patients. Regarding the Th17 response, patients with pAPS and HC showed a significantly lower frequency of circulating Th17 cells than SLE. However, no differences were observed in the Th1 response between patients and controls. Thus, increased Th17/Th1 and Th17/Treg ratios were found in SLE patients but not in pAPS patients. pAPS and SLE patients had higher serum IL-6 levels than HC but there was not difference between both disease groups. Besides, a significant increase in the immunosuppressive cytokine levels was observed only in pAPS as compared to HC. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our data demonstrate an increased inflammatory profile of peripheral blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from SLE as compared with pAPS mostly due to an increased Th17 response. In conclusion, there seems not to be a direct pathogenic role for Th cells in pAPS but in SLE.",3
"A diminished ovarian reserve is a very strong indicator of infertility, even in an a priori non-infertile population.",diminished ovarian reserve AND infertility AND general population AND fertility prediction,40102966,"[PMID: 40102966] Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a useful marker of ovarian reserve in reproductive-aged women. However, the predictive value of AMH for the occurrence of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy has limits. We reported a patient with extreme low AMH achieved spontaneous conception three times. A 35-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, with a history of one miscarriage, presented with a one-year history of secondary infertility seeking reproductive assistance. Laboratory evaluation showed negligible (0.072 ng/mL or 0.514 pmol/L) AMH levels and ultrasound revealed reduced bilateral antral follicle count (AFC). She was diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and counseled about her limited fertility prognosis. Despite recommendations for assisted reproductive techniques (ART), the patient pursued spontaneous conception. Two natural cycles and two ovulation induction cycles were conducted, utilizing recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with ovulation triggered by 8,000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Remarkably, the patient successfully conceived three pregnancies and delivered four healthy children. In April 2022, she gave birth to a healthy boy weighing 3.17 kg via spontaneous vaginal delivery. In August 2023, she delivered another healthy boy weighing 3.80 kg via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Subsequently, in November 2024, she delivered healthy twins-one boy and one girl-via spontaneous vaginal delivery. This case underscores the clinical significance of specialized reproductive medicine intervention in achieving successful pregnancy outcomes in patients with rapidly declining and persistently low AMH levels. It highlights that even in cases of severely diminished ovarian reserve, natural conception is possible with expert guidance. Clinicians should exercise prudence when providing prognostic guidance regarding fertility among patients presenting with markedly diminished or undetectable AMH concentrations. The application of AMH measurement for fertility assessment in the general population still need to be clarified in well-designed prospective studies. Not applicable.",1
APOE4 expression in iPSC-derived neurons results in decreased tau phosphorylation.,APOE4 expression AND iPSC-derived neurons AND tau phosphorylation AND neurodegeneration,"41187062,35142023,29632371","[PMID: 41187062] While neuronal activity is essential for brain function, it also poses threats to neuronal integrity. Here, we show that activity-induced expression of stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) protects neurons from degeneration. Previously considered germline specific, Stra8 is expressed in the adult mouse brain and is induced by neuronal activity via calcium influx and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling. Neuron-specific Stra8 knockout mice display hallmark features of neurodegeneration, including DNA damage, impaired proteostasis, inflammation, nuclear envelope erosion, reduced dendritic plasticity, memory deficits, and heightened excitotoxic vulnerability. Electrophysiological studies reveal disrupted inhibitory circuit function. Mechanistically, Stra8 binds regulatory regions of neuromodulator genes and regulates their expression. Notably, Stra8 loss upregulates the expression of Npas4, an immediate-early gene critical for inhibitory circuits, but the aberrant protein is mislocalized to the nuclear periphery. These findings identify Stra8 as an activity-dependent transcriptional regulator that safeguards neuronal structure and function.

[PMID: 35142023] The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ2 allele reduces risk against Alzheimer's disease (AD) but mechanisms underlying this effect are largely unknown. We conducted a genome-wide association study for AD among 2096 ɛ2 carriers. The potential role of the top-ranked gene and complement 4 (C4) proteins, which were previously linked to AD in ɛ2 carriers, was investigated using human isogenic APOE allele-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes and in 224 neuropathologically examined human brains. PPP2CB rs117296832 was the second most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphism among ɛ2 carriers (P = 1.1 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ) and the AD risk allele increased PPP2CB expression in blood (P = 6.6 × 10<sup>-27</sup> ). PPP2CB expression was correlated with phosphorylated tau231/total tau ratio (P = .01) and expression of C4 protein subunits C4A/B (P = 2.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ) in the iPSCs. PPP2CB (subunit of protein phosphatase 2A) and C4b protein levels were correlated in brain (P = 3.3 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ). PP2A may be linked to classical complement activation leading to AD-related tau pathology.

[PMID: 29632371] Efforts to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail in human trials, suggesting a pressing need to study AD in human model systems. Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.",3
ART has no effect on the infectiveness of HIV-positive people.,antiretroviral therapy AND HIV infectiousness AND ART effectiveness AND HIV-positive outcomes,"41051588,40934266,40712615","[PMID: 41051588] An undetectable viral load (VL) in people living with HIV (PWH) is key to both individual and public health success. But for the millions of PWH on oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) worldwide, this requires consistent, sustained adherence. Review of interventions to support adherence published in recent literature can provide insights into promising and effective strategies. We conducted a hybrid systematic-narrative literature review to explore optimal adherence strategies in the era of universal test-and-treat. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science according to PRISMA guidelines for peer-reviewed studies, available in English, including people ≥ 12 years old taking ART, published between 01 January 2015 and 18 January 2024. We extracted data on the included studies and the adherence interventions (strategies used -allocated to one of 14 a priori categories or 'other', measures of adherence, and intervention outcomes). Descriptive statistics were used for study information and those interventions with a positive effect were described narratively. We extracted data from 230 studies evaluating a total of 262 interventions among 97,037 PWH. Most studies enrolled participants in Africa (106, 46%) or North America (80, 35%). The majority randomized participants (215, 94%), including 30 cluster-randomized trials. Most included general HIV clinic populations, with 51 (22%) focused on youth and 23 (10%) on pregnant and post-partum women. Many (146, 64%) used VL as an outcome. Self-reported adherence was also a commonly used outcome (129, 56%), but a minority used self-reported measures alone (36, 16%). The most common intervention strategies included across the 262 interventions were eHealth/ mHealth technologies (90, 34%) and adherence-focused counseling (81, 31%). The majority of interventions had 'other' intervention features (133, 51%), typically combined with one or more of the a priori-defined strategies (107, 80%). Most studies evaluated an approach with multiple strategies packaged into a single intervention (k = 182/262, 70%).The majority of interventions had some evidence of effect on an adherence outcome (k = 159, 61%). In studies reporting VL outcomes, 52% (k = 87/166) found some evidence of effect, while 28% (k = 47/166) found significant effects. Intervention strategies demonstrating significant impact on VL included task-shifting and changing dispensing schedules (3/5, 60% in both), while nearly half the evaluations of economic strategies demonstrated significant impact on VL (10/21). A number of different adherence intervention strategies have the potential to impact viral suppression in different populations. Variability in intervention strategies and the resulting outcomes, supports calls to target interventions to PWH who are most likely to benefit, while at the same time addressing social determinants of health and reducing barriers to accessing care to make services more person-centered. Greater attention to evaluating flexible, tailored, complex interventions may offer valuable insights for moving towards the next generation of highly generalizable, sustainable adherence support.

[PMID: 40934266] Despite universal HIV test-and-treat policy in South Africa, vertical transmission continues to occur. We evaluated the temporal effectiveness of vertical transmission prevention (VTP) over three maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) policy periods (three-drug ART accessible to those with CD4 counts <200 cells/µl (January 2010 - March 2010); < 350 cells/µl (April 2010 - April 2013); and lifelong ART regardless of CD4 count (May 2013 - December 2020)) in Western Cape, South Africa using public sector routine individuated data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with child HIV infection as the primary outcome. The cohort of 842 641 pregnancies from 2010-2020, inclusive of child HIV exposure, maternal ART, and child outcomes, was enumerated using administrative, laboratory and pharmacy data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations with vertical transmission. The proportion of pregnant women living with HIV (WLWH) initiating ART prior to pregnancy increased from 20.9% in 2010 to 71.1% in 2020. Of all pregnancies 17.1% (143 987/842 641) were HIV exposed and 16.3% (137 572/842 641) had a record of a child HIV outcome, of whom 3966 (2.9%) were HIV positive by 24 months. Among children with known maternal HIV exposure (143 987), 32.0% had unknown HIV status and 2.1% were diagnosed with HIV by study closure. In 2020, HIV status was ascertained in 87.2% (16 908/19 382) of children exposed to HIV. Children born in policy period 3 were less likely to have HIV than children born in policy period 2 (aOR 0.66; 95% CI 0.60-0.72), mediated through expanded ART access. Between 2017 and 2020, 16.5% of child HIV diagnoses were from pregnancies without maternal HIV exposure records. Young maternal age, no antenatal ART, previous tuberculosis and no records of antenatal visits were associated with vertical transmission in all periods. Using routine data, we report an increase in WLWH initiating ART prior to pregnancy, and a decline in vertical transmission of HIV over three policy periods. Although HIV diagnosis amongst children exposed to HIV has reduced over time, the proportion of infections in children without established exposure emphasises the need to optimise VTP opportunities.

[PMID: 40712615] In sub-Saharan Africa, 20-40% of people living with HIV present with advanced HIV disease (AHD), which can be diagnosed, treated, and prevented using a package of care recommended by WHO. We aimed to project the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the WHO-recommended AHD package in Malawi. Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International model, we simulated a cohort of non-hospitalised people living with HIV (aged >19 years) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), 25% of whom had AHD (CD4 count <200 cells per μL and/or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease). We assessed 13 increasingly comprehensive strategies, ranging from ART only to the WHO-recommended AHD package, including tuberculosis diagnostics (ie, sputum Xpert and urine lipoarabinomannan), tuberculosis preventive therapy, serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening with pre-emptive fluconazole treatment if CrAg-positive, and co-trimoxazole to prevent bacterial infections. Model outcomes included 1 year survival, life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, US$ per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]); we considered a strategy cost-effective if the ICER was less than $600 per QALY (based on 2023 Malawi per capita gross domestic product). ART only resulted in life expectancy of 17·45 undiscounted QALYs and discounted lifetime costs of $1450. All other strategies would increase both QALYs and costs. The WHO-recommended AHD package would result in the greatest life expectancy (19·30 undiscounted QALYs) and be cost-effective (ICER $580 per QALY). AHD prevalence and intervention efficacy had the greatest influence on ICERs; however, the WHO-recommended AHD package would remain cost-effective over a wide range of estimates. The WHO-recommended AHD package of care at ART initiation would provide substantial clinical benefits and be cost-effective in Malawi. This package for AHD should be made widely available in Malawi and similar settings.

Activation of PPM1D enhances p53 function.,PPM1D AND p53 activation AND PPM1D activation AND p53 phosphorylation,"39787991,36456590","[PMID: 39787991] PP2C serine-threonine phosphatase Wip1 plays an important role in normal tissue homeostasis, stress signaling and pathogenesis of various human diseases. It is an attractive drug target for cancer treatment and inhibition of its expression or activity constitute a novel therapeutic intervention strategy to prevent the development of various cancers. However, previous strategies for Wip1 suppression may be ineffective in cancers lacking p53. Here, we have characterized the activity of a novel Wip1 phosphatase activator, QGC-8-52, in preclinical models of breast malignancies. QGC-8-52 significantly sensitizes the cancer cell lines with p53 deletion to chemotherapeutic agents. This effect was mediated by the Wip1-FOXO3a interaction and subsequent dephosphorylation of Thr487 that resulted, in response to anticancer treatment, in enhancing the transcription activity of FOXO3a on the proapoptotic TRAIL gene. The sensitizing effect of Wip1 activation on chemotherapeutic drugs only targeted cancer cells lacking p53. The activation of Wip1 in normal cells provided protection from anticancer drug-induced apoptosis by reducing the strength of upstream signaling to p53. Therefore, during the treatment of anticancer drugs, the activated Wip1 phosphatase boosts the apoptosis of p53-negative tumors and protects normal tissues. Our findings may represent an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for cancers with p53 deletion.

[PMID: 36456590] The p53 transcription factor is a master regulator of cellular stress responses inhibited by repressors such as MDM2 and the phosphatase PPM1D. Activation of p53 with pharmacological inhibitors of its repressors is being tested in clinical trials for cancer therapy, but efficacy has been limited by poor induction of tumor cell death. We demonstrate that dual inhibition of MDM2 and PPM1D induces apoptosis in multiple cancer cell types via amplification of the p53 transcriptional program through the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway. PPM1D inhibition induces phosphorylation of eIF2α, ATF4 accumulation, and ATF4-dependent enhancement of p53-dependent transactivation upon MDM2 inhibition. Dual inhibition of p53 repressors depletes heme and induces HRI-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation. Pharmacological induction of eIF2α phosphorylation synergizes with MDM2 inhibition to induce cell death and halt tumor growth in mice. These results demonstrate that PPM1D inhibits both the p53 network and the integrated stress response controlled by eIF2α-ATF4, with clear therapeutic implications.",2
Active Ly49Q prevents neutrophil polarization.,Ly49Q AND neutrophil polarization AND signaling pathways AND immune response,"41187220,41187379,41187293","[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187293] Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fatal disease. Current clinically approved treatments slow disease progression but are not curative. Thus, there is a critical need to better define the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF and develop novel approaches to treat this devastating lung condition. Immune dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, accompanied by fibrosis, constitutes a key hallmark of IPF. IPF is generally considered to be a fibroproliferative disorder rather than an immune condition because, historically, immunomodulatory therapies have failed to produce significant clinical effect. This lack of response is frustrating given that there is evidence of immune dysfunction in IPF and highlights the need to clarify the role of immune cells and inflammatory pathways in IPF. There is increasing evidence that the extracellular matrix (ECM) directs cell fate and function, and we propose that ECM remodeling and immune dysfunction in IPF generate a self-perpetuating fibrotic circuit that is refractory to classical anti-inflammatory agents. Understanding the relationship between ECM and immune dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis could help identify novel therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease.",3

The effect of 12-week alirocumab (150 mg subcutaneously fortnightly) on the kinetics of apo(a) was compared in statin-treated patients with high (n = 10) and very high Lp(a) concentrations (n = 11). In patients with high apo(a) concentrations, alirocumab lowered plasma apo(a) pool size (-17%, p < 0.01) chiefly by increasing the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of apo(a) (+27%, p < 0.001). By contrast in patients with very high apo(a) concentrations, alirocumab significantly lowered plasma apo(a) pool size (-32%, p < 0.001) by both increasing apo(a) FCR (+30%, p < 0.001) and lowering production rate (-11%, p < 0.05). In statin-treated patients with very high apo(a) concentrations, alirocumab lowers plasma Lp(a) concentration by a dual mode of action that increases the clearance and decreases the production of Lp(a) particles.

Allogeneic mechanical circulatory support is not as effective as autologous mechanical circulatory support for treating acute myocardial infarction.,allogeneic mechanical circulatory support AND autologous mechanical circulatory support AND acute myocardial infarction AND effectiveness comparison,"41187376,41187353,41187351","[PMID: 41187376] There is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of current hospital-based follow-up after treatment for gynaecological cancers. Moreover, patients often report their aftercare needs are unmet. In an era of increasing pressure on healthcare resources - alongside a growing emphasis on patient-empowerment and appropriate care - it is time to reconsider current follow-up practices for gynaecological cancer survivors. This has led to a growing body of research exploring new approaches to follow-up care in gynaecologic oncology. In this scoping review, we aim to explore these alternative follow-up approaches and evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to current follow-up care. The methodological framework for scoping studies by Arksey and O'Malley's was used, further guided by the PRISMA-ScR checklist. A literature search on follow-up care for gynaecological cancers was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid) and Cochrane Library. Included studies employed a comparative method, allowing assessment of alternative approaches relative to current follow-up. Data were charted according to the TIDieR checklist and guide for better reporting of interventions. Eighteen articles were included, identifying three categories of alternative follow-up strategies: nurse-led follow-up, reduced follow-up and patient-initiated follow-up. Across all categories, these approaches showed similar - and sometimes improved - effect on oncological outcomes, quality of life, and/or patient satisfaction, without increased costs and healthcare use. Follow-up care can be delivered in alternative ways, without compromising on patient experiences or oncological safety. This offers the possibility of more cost-effective and resource-efficient healthcare. These findings support the feasibility of using alternative follow-up strategies in gynaecological oncological care.

[PMID: 41187353] The appearance time of blood components in the brain provides complementary information about cerebral microvascular dynamics. Plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) behave differently in the microcirculation: while plasma can pass through peripheral layers of capillaries, RBCs carry oxygen and are affected by phenomena such as the Fåhræus-Lindqvist effect and plasma skimming. Our study aims at visualizing these differences in vivo using H<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O PET to assess plasma appearance time (ATPlasma) and<sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub>PET to assess RBC appearance time (ATRBC), and demonstrated that the relative delay of RBCs compared with plasma correlates with the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). &#xD;Methods We retrospectively analyzed PET images obtained with<sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub>and H<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O administration in 40 patients, comprising a total of 63 scan data. Appearance time images were generated by fitting tissue curves both for the<sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub>(AT<sub>RBC</sub>) andH<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O phases (AT<sub>Plasma</sub>). AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>values were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs) and compared. Additionally, differences between AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>(ΔAT) were analyzed in relation to OEF. &#xD;Results: AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>images exhibited similar spatial distributions. A strong correlation was observed between them as AT<sub>RBC</sub>= 0.80·AT<sub>Plasma</sub>+ 1.8,<i>r</i>= 0.86), suggesting that RBCs flow faster than plasma. The difference between the two (ΔAT) showed a moderate correlation with OEF (<i>r</i>= 0.44), indicating that higher OEF values are associated with slower RBC movement relative to plasma. This finding suggests that under certain ischemic conditions, RBC flow is more severely impaired than plasma flow. &#xD;Conclusion: This study demonstrates that AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>are closely related measures of cerebral blood appearance time. The observed association between their difference and OEF suggests a potential link to ischemic pathology.

[PMID: 41187351] Epidemiological studies of large groups of nuclear industry workers offer a significant opportunity to increase our understanding of the long-term effects on health of the protracted accumulation of dose received at a low dose rate from many discrete exposures to ionising radiation. The effects of such extended aggregation of doses form an important part of the everyday concerns of radiological protection against low-level exposures. For more than half a century, databases of nuclear workers have been assembled, and the numbers of workers currently included in studies, together with the numbers of deaths among them that have now occurred, are capable of generating reasonably precise risk estimates that should provide meaningful comparisons with those obtained from other studies, such as of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, constructing, updating and maintaining these large databases, linking workers to occupational dose databases and to registers of deaths (and other outcomes, such as incident cancers) and their causes, and analyses of these data that endeavour to take account of other influential factors (such as smoking) are far from straightforward. A critical review of recent nuclear worker studies illustrates the difficulties in reliably interpreting reported statistical associations between rates of cancer and cumulative occupational doses because of the real possibility of distortions produced by biases, confounding and/or the interplay of radiation with other risk factors. This doesn't mean that studies of nuclear workers should be abandoned, far from it, but it does mean that appropriate effort needs to be expended on these studies before confident conclusions about the levels of risks from radiation exposure can be drawn from them. Unexpected findings should be examined in depth to gain a proper understanding of their origin, including the impact of doses from intakes of radionuclides upon dose-responses derived using doses from external sources of radiation.",3
Alteration of origin firing causes changes in termination zones of Okazaki fragments.,origin firing AND DNA replication initiation AND Okazaki fragments AND replication termination zones,"41171880,41170431,41140146","[PMID: 41171880] The germinal center (GC) reaction drives the production of high-affinity antibodies by iterative cycles of B cell somatic hypermutation, selection, and proliferation. How GC B cells undergo rapid cell division while maintaining genome stability is poorly understood. Here, we show that the RNA binding proteins ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 act downstream of antigen sensing and protect GC B cells from replication stress by controlling a cell cycle-related posttranscriptional regulon. They safeguard the successful completion of mitosis by balancing CDK1 and p21-mediated regulation of cell-cycle progression. In their absence, GC B cells are prone to arrest in the G<sub>2</sub>-M phase and die by apoptosis, resulting in curtailed GC responses. DNA replication forks stalled at active replication initiation zones, causing replication stress and increased activity of the ATR-CHK1 DNA damage response. Thus, RNA binding proteins guide posttranscriptional gene regulation and maintain a functional G<sub>2</sub>-M checkpoint in GC B cells.

[PMID: 41170431] <i>Pochonia chlamydosporia</i> is an important egg-parasitic fungus with potential applications in the biological control of parasitic pests. However, the protein-response mechanisms during <i>P. chlamydosporia</i> infection of nematode eggs remain unclear. In this study, we employed four-dimensional data-independent acquisition (4D-DIA) proteomic sequencing to analyze the changes in the mycelial proteome of <i>P. chlamydosporia</i> at different infection stages. In total, 4,293 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified, which were mainly involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis and modification, oxidative stress, and other key biological processes. In the early stages of infestation, the fungus rapidly adapted to the host environment by enhancing metabolism and protein synthesis, initiating the infestation mechanism, and simultaneously enhancing its antioxidant capacity to cope with the host defense response. At later stages, it fine-tuned the metabolic pathways and enhanced DNA replication to maintain proliferation and continuously strengthened the antioxidant response to host oxidative stress. In addition, the number of proteins related to fungal transporter activity varied significantly after induction, indicating that a variety of transmembrane proteins may be involved in host recognition, adhesion, and formation of invasive structures. This study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying <i>P. chlamydosporia</i> parasitic activity and establishes a theoretical foundation for the development of novel biocontrol strategies for this fungus.

[PMID: 41140146] DNA copy number changes are the most frequent genomic alterations in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that Rad27/FEN1, a structure-specific nuclease in budding yeast, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats. Severe rDNA instability is observed in the rad27∆ mutant, independently of Fob1-mediated DNA replication fork arrest and DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation in the rDNA. The rad27Δ mutant accumulates Okazaki fragments in the rDNA region, without inducing the formation of detectable DSBs. Similar rDNA instability is observed in DNA ligase<sup>Cdc9</sup>-deficient cells. Furthermore, Exonuclease 1 and PCNA partially compensate for the loss of Rad27 in rDNA stabilization. These findings highlight the importance of proper Okazaki fragment maturation in the maintenance of rDNA stability.",3
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.,ambulatory blood pressure monitoring AND inaccuracies AND hypertension AND diagnostic limitations,"15593030,14763666,2963523","[PMID: 15593030] Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been developed to overcome recognized deficiencies and inaccuracies of classic (office) BP measurements in the diagnosis and management of hypertension (HTN). Although in adults it has become a valuable tool for the diagnosis and ongoing management of HTN, and its use has been documented in over 50 studies in children, few pediatric nephrologists systematically use this approach for HTN assessment. Some of the reluctance to completely embrace the technique comes from the fact that none of the major hypertension trials has been based on ambulatory BP readings. The prognostic information from ABPM studies is slowly accumulating, but there is still relatively little information on the long-term prognostic value of ABPM-derived readings. For children there are particular problems in measuring representative BP values. It would be very helpful to know to what extent ABPM can help. However, there have been few comprehensive reviews in this particular population, which leaves the practicing nephrologist rather confused. The purpose of this review is to assess the present state of knowledge of ABPM usage in children, high-lighting important studies that help to delineate the place of ABPM in their medical management. We discuss: advantages and limitations of ABPM, the variability of blood pressure in children, clinical uses of ABPM in pre-dialysis renal failure, dialysis, renal transplantation, primary renal diseases, and diabetes, comparison with adult data. The relationship between casual BP (CBP) and ABPM is presented, specifically the prevalence and relevance of either white-coat hypertension or relative 'office' hypertension. We conclude that in 2004, the sole reliance on casual BP to diagnose and to treat hypertension in children brings with it many difficulties. ABPM offers some clear solutions to these problems and thus should be routinely used in appropriately defined clinical settings, but is not a panacea.

[PMID: 14763666] Validation protocols that have been introduced for automated blood pressure (BP) measuring devices recommend procedures carried out at rest only. We aimed to determine whether venous blood redistribution affects the accuracy of the oscillometric method of BP measurement. For this purpose, we chose a popular oscillometric ambulatory BP monitor--the SpaceLabs 90207 (Osc). Lower body negative pressure (-40 mmHg) (LBNP) was used to simulate changes of body position. Fifty-one young healthy volunteers had their BP measured simultaneously by Osc and mercury sphygmomanometer (HgS) at rest (min 3 and 5), during LBNP (min 7 and 9) and after LBNP (min 11). Differences (delta, mmHg) between HgS and Osc for systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were calculated for every measurement minute. For SBP, deltaSBP-7 and deltaSBP-9 were significantly different from deltaSBP-5 (0.65 +/- 2.6 and 0.33 +/- 2.4 mmHg vs -0.80 +/- 2.9 mmHg, p < 0.003 and p < 0.02, respectively). deltaSBP-11 also differed significantly from deltaSBP-3 and deltaSBP-5 (1.16 +/- 2.5 mmHg vs -0.06 +/- 3.1 mmHg and -0.80 +/- 2.9, p < 0.01 and p < 0.00007, respectively). When graded according to British Hypertension Society protocol, Osc remained in the A class in every measurement minute. The accuracy of SpaceLabs 90207 is altered by venous blood redistribution. These inaccuracies may constitute an additional limitation of oscillometric ambulatory BP monitoring.

[PMID: 2963523] The use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has gained popularity because it is not subject to those limitations associated with traditional sphygmomanometry (inaccuracy of blood pressure readings, low number of readings, and failure to represent daytime blood pressure readings). In the present study, we provide evidence that the 24-hour mean blood pressure obtained through intraarterial blood pressure measurements in ambulatory patients provides a more accurate diagnosis (and perhaps a prognosis) of hypertension than that provided by cuff-obtained casual blood pressure measurement. Furthermore, despite a reduction in the amount and in the accuracy of the information obtained, blood pressure data provided by noninvasive blood pressure monitoring are also more accurate diagnostically than cuff-obtained casual blood pressure measurements. In 15 essential hypertensive patients in whom celiprolol, 400 mg once daily, was compared with placebo in a randomized double-blind crossover study, the use of noninvasive 24-hour automatic blood pressure monitoring showed that in responsive patients, celiprolol induced a sustained reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the 24 hours. The blood pressure reduction was also apparent during the night, despite the concomitant occurrence of a slight tachycardia. These findings demonstrate that once-daily administration of celiprolol provides an effective lowering of the 24-hour blood pressure profile. This dosing schedule can therefore be regarded as appropriate for antihypertensive therapy.",3
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with decreased risk for functional renal insufficiency.,ACE inhibitors AND functional renal insufficiency AND risk reduction AND angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,"39586724,37889557,37539955","[PMID: 39586724] To analyze the effects of preoperative renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) use on postoperative renal function and short-term and long-term prognosis in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted. Based on the registration study data of CABG patients at Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the clinical data of adult patients who underwent CABG from January 2013 to December 2022 were analyzed. Preoperative use of RASi (PreRASi) was defined as receiving RASi treatment within 48 hours before surgery. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined using the diagnostic criteria of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). Demographic characteristics, past medical history, comorbidities, preoperative medication, preoperative laboratory test results, specific information on surgical procedures, and postoperative treatment related data were extracted. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative AKI. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital all-cause mortality and all-cause mortality within the longest follow-up period. According to whether RASi was used before surgery, the patients were divided into PreRASi group and No-PreRASi group. The baseline data of the two groups were balanced by propensity score matching (PSM). Logistic regression model and Cox proportional hazards model were used to assess the correlation between PreRASi and postoperative AKI and clinical outcomes, and analyze the subgroups of hypertension and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the cohort. A total of 33 884 patients who underwent CABG were included, with a mean follow-up duration of (3.0±2.4) years and the longest follow-up duration up to 8.5 years. There were 9 128 cases (26.94%) in the PreRASi group and 24 756 cases (73.06%) in the No-PreRASi group. The incidence of postoperative AKI in the PreRASi group was 47.61% (4 346 cases), compared to 52.37% (12 964 cases) in the No-PreRASi group. Two groups were matched with 5 094 patients each. Compared to the No-PreRASi group, both before and after PSM, PreRASi was associated with a reduction of risk of postoperative AKI [before PSM: odds ratio (OR) = 0.834, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.793-0.877, P < 0.001; after PSM: OR = 0.875, 95%CI was 0.808-0.948, P = 0.001]. Subgroup analysis of hypertensive and HFpEF patients showed that PreRASi was associated with a decreased risk of postoperative AKI before and after PSM. The in-hospital mortality for the PreRASi and No-PreRASi groups were 0.61% (56 cases) and 0.49% (121 cases), respectively. Analysis of the overall cohort and subgroups with hypertension and HFpEF showed no correlation between PreRASi and in-hospital mortality or longest follow-up mortality. The perioperative use of RASi can reduce the risk of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing CABG, has a certain renal protective effect, but is not associated with short-term or long-term death risk after surgery.

[PMID: 37889557] The purpose of this review is to summarize the latest evidence on the prevention and progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), as well as novel pharmacological interventions from preclinical and early clinical studies with promising findings in the reduction of this condition's burden. We will cover the latest evidence on the reduction of proteinuria and kidney function decline in DKD achieved through established renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system blockade and the more recent addition of SGLT2i, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and GLP1-RA, that combined will most likely integrate the mainstay for current DKD treatment. We also highlight evidence from new mechanisms of action in DKD, including other haemodynamic anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic interventions, oxidative stress modulators and cell identity and epigenetic targets. Renal specific outcome trials have become more popular and are increasing the available armamentarium to diminish the progression of renal decline in patients at greater risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) such as diabetic individuals. A combined pharmaceutical approach based on available rigorous studies should include RAAS blockade, SGLT2 inhibitors, nonsteroidal MRA and expectedly GLP1-RA on a personalized based-intervention. New specific trials designed to address renal outcomes will be needed for innovative therapies to conclude on their potential benefits in DKD.

[PMID: 37539955] Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, is caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017. To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination. We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two other trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). We included three RCTs with 385 participants. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology, downgrading for risk of bias concerns, indirectness, and imprecision. Hydroxyurea versus placebo One RCT published in 2011 compared hydroxyurea to placebo in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. We are unsure if hydroxyurea compared to placebo reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate (mean difference (MD) 0.58 mL/min /1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76; 142 participants; very low certainty). Hydroxyurea compared to placebo may improve the ability to concentrate urine (MD 42.23 mOsm/kg, 95% CI 12.14 to 72.32; 178 participants; low certainty), and may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events, including acute chest syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 99% CI 0.13 to 1.16; 193 participants; low certainty), painful crisis (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.45 to 1.02; 193 participants; low certainty); and hospitalisations (RR 0.83, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 193 participants; low certainty). No deaths occurred in either trial arm and the RCT did not report quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo One RCT published in 1998 compared an ACEI (captopril) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if captopril compared to placebo reduces proteinuria (MD -49.00 mg/day, 95% CI -124.10 to 26.10; 22 participants; very low certainty). We are unsure if captopril reduces or prevents kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance; the trial authors stated that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but provided no comparative data (very low certainty). The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C One RCT published in 2020 compared an ACEI (lisinopril) with vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. It reported no data we could analyse. We are unsure if lisinopril compared to vitamin C reduces proteinuria in this population: the large drop in microalbuminuria in both arms of the trial after only one month on treatment may have been due to an overestimation of microalbuminuria at baseline rather than a true effect. The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if ACEI compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No RCTs assessed red blood cell transfusions or any combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although we found four ongoing trials since the last version of this review. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEIs or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.",3
Antidepressants increase the severity of migraines.,antidepressants AND effect AND migraine severity AND antidepressant impact,"25610528,35151971,32695028","[PMID: 25610528] Patients with bipolar disorder are exceptionally challenging to manage because of the dynamic, chronic, and fluctuating nature of their disease. Typically, the symptoms of bipolar disorder first appear in adolescence or early adulthood, and are repeated over the patient's lifetime, expressed as unpredictable recurrences of hypomanic/manic or depressive episodes. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder in adults is reported to be approximately 4%, and its management was estimated to cost the US healthcare system in 2009 $150 billion in combined direct and indirect costs. To review the published literature and describe the personal and societal burdens associated with bipolar disorder, the impact of delays in accurate diagnosis, and the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of available pharmacologic therapies. The studies in this comprehensive review were selected for inclusion based on clinical relevance, importance, and robustness of data related to diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder. The search terms that were initially used on MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar were restricted to 1994 through 2014 and included ""bipolar disorder,"" ""mania,"" ""bipolar depression,"" ""mood stabilizer,"" ""atypical antipsychotics,"" and ""antidepressants."" High-quality, recent reviews of major relevant topics were included to supplement the primary studies. Substantial challenges facing patients with bipolar disorder, in addition to their severe mood symptoms, include frequent incidence of psychiatric (eg, anxiety disorders, alcohol or drug dependence) and general medical comorbidities (eg, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, migraine, and hepatitis C virus infection). It has been reported that more than 75% of patients take their medication less than 75% of the time, and the rate of suicide (0.4%) among patients with bipolar disorder is more than 20 times greater than in the general US population. Mood stabilizers are the cornerstone of treatment of bipolar disorder, but atypical antipsychotics are broadly as effective; however, differences in efficacy exist between individual agents in the treatment of the various phases of bipolar disorder, including treatment of acute mania or acute depression symptoms, and in the prevention of relapse. The challenges involved in managing bipolar disorder over a patient's lifetime are the result of the dynamic, chronic, and fluctuating nature of this disease. Diligent selection of a treatment that takes into account its efficacy in the various phases of the disorder, along with the safety profile identified in clinical trials and in the real world can help ameliorate the impact of this devastating condition.

The first group received amitriptyline at a dose of 25 mg every night, and the second group received venlafaxine at a dose of 37.5 mg daily. The duration of treatment was eight weeks. Eighty patients participated in the current study, out of which 57.5% were females. The mean age of the participants was 33 years, and the mean duration of disease was eight years. Both amitriptyline and venlafaxine significantly reduced the number of attacks per month (AMT: from 10.98 to 2.98, VLF: from 9.98 to 3.18), and six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score (AMT: from 67.78 to 49.73, VLF: from 66.65 to 48.88), and no significant difference was observed between the two drugs. The results demonstrated no significant relationship between age or disease duration with the score of the HIT-6. The decrease rate in the score of the HIT-6 in males was higher than that of females which shows the modifier role of the gender. Besides, it is noteworthy to mention that the adverse effects of amitriptyline exceeded the venlafaxine among the patients. The effectiveness of AMT and VLF in terms of their potential to reduce the intensity and duration of headaches was more noticeable in male patients than female patients. In terms of adverse drug reactions, patients in the amitriptyline group complained more about adverse drug reactions (ADR) than patients in the venlafaxine group. It seems that in similar conditions, venlafaxine could have priority over amitriptyline in migraine prophylaxis.

[PMID: 32695028] Lack of proper consideration of the interaction between biological and environmental factors limits our understanding of the development of depression. Our cross-sectional study investigated whether recent stress influences the effect of affective temperaments on depressive symptoms. 1015 general population participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory to capture depressive symptoms, the List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire to assess recent stressors, and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis Pisa, Paris, and San Diego Autoquestionnaire to evaluate affective temperaments (TEMPS-A). Linear regression models were built to investigate the effect of temperament and stress on depression, temperament on stress, and the effect of temperament on depressive symptoms in different stress exposure groups. Recent life events and anxious, depressive, cyclothymic, and hyperthymic temperaments significantly predicted depressive symptoms, and cyclothymic, and hyperthymic temperaments significantly predicted recent life event exposure. While in case of mild stress all affective temperaments except irritable predicted depression, in case of moderate exposure only the effect of depressive, cyclothymic, and hyperthymic temperament, while in the high exposure group only the effect of anxious temperament was significant. All measures were based on self-report, and subjective impact of life events was not considered. This was a cross-sectional study with a correlational nature which does not allow for causative conclusions. The contribution of affective temperaments to depression is much higher compared to stress, and severity of exposure to life events influences the impact of affective temperaments on depressive symptoms, pointing to divergent pathways of emotional reactivity mediating the effects of stress on depression which can be exploited for prevention and treatment.",3
Antimicrobial agents are more effective due to the pressure of antimicrobial usage.,Antimicrobial agents AND Effectiveness AND Usage pressure AND Microbial stress,"38735077,37094669,32247035","[PMID: 38735077] Due to the specific action on bacterial cell wall, β-lactam antibiotics have gained widespread usage as they exhibit a high degree of specificity in targeting bacteria, but causing minimal toxicity to host cells. Under antibiotic pressure, bacteria may opt to shed their cell walls and transform into L-form state as a means to evade the antibiotic effects. In this study, we explored and identified diverse optimal conditions for both Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli DH5α (CTX)) and Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis ATCC6633), which were induced to L-form bacteria using lysozyme (0.5 ppm) and meropenem (64 ppm). Notably, when bacteria transformed into L-form state, both bacterial strains showed varying degrees of increased resistance to antibiotics polymyxin E, meropenem, rifampicin, and tetracycline. E. coli DH5α (CTX) exhibited the most significant enhancement in resistance to tetracycline, with a 128-fold increase, while B. subtilis ATCC6633 showed a 32-fold increase in resistance to tetracycline and polymyxin E. Furthermore, L-form bacteria maintained their normal metabolic activity, combined with enhanced oxidative stress, served as an adaptive strategy promoting the sustained survival of L-form bacteria. This study provided a theoretical basis for comprehending antibiotic resistance mechanisms, developing innovative treatment strategies, and confronting global antibiotic resistance challenges.

[PMID: 37094669] During COVID-19 pandemic, chemicals from excessive consumption of pharmaceuticals and disinfectants i.e., antibiotics, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), and trihalomethanes (THMs), flowed into the urban environment, imposing unprecedented selective pressure to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To decipher the obscure character pandemic-related chemicals portrayed in altering environmental AMR, 40 environmental samples covering water and soil matrix from surroundings of Wuhan designated hospitals were collected on March 2020 and June 2020. Chemical concentrations and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles were revealed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and metagenomics. Selective pressure from pandemic-related chemicals ascended by 1.4-5.8 times in March 2020 and then declined to normal level of pre-pandemic period in June 2020. Correspondingly, the relative abundance of ARGs under increasing selective pressure was 20.1 times that under normal selective pressure. Moreover, effect from QACs and THMs in aggravating the prevalence of AMR was elaborated by null model, variation partition and co-occurrence network analyses. Pandemic-related chemicals, of which QACs and THMs respectively displayed close interaction with efflux pump genes and mobile genetic elements, contributed >50 % in shaping ARG profile. QACs bolstered the cross resistance effectuated by qacEΔ1 and cmeB to 3.0 times higher while THMs boosted horizon ARG transfer by 7.9 times for initiating microbial response to oxidative stress. Under ascending selective pressure, qepA encoding quinolone efflux pump and oxa-20 encoding β-lactamases were identified as priority ARGs with potential human health risk. Collectively, this research validated the synergistic effect of QACs and THMs in exacerbating environmental AMR, appealing for the rational usage of disinfectants and the attention for environmental microbes in one-health perspective.

[PMID: 32247035] Salmonella is an important pathogen for public health due to food poisoning and acute infectious intestinal disease by zoonotic trait. We isolated Salmonella enterica QH which represents the normal growth condition in Luria-Bertani culture and displays a wide range of susceptibility for multiple antibiotics. To further investigate genetic and pathogenic traits of S. enterica QH, the sequencing genome of S. enterica QH and oral Salmonella infection in mice were performed in this study. Compared with other Salmonella strains, several large sequences containing prophages and genomic islands were inserted into S. enterica QH genome. Furthermore, nucleotide and synonymous codon usage patterns display mutation pressure and natural selection serving as drivers for the evolutionary trend of S. enterica QH at gene level. The unique codon usage pattern of S. enterica QH probably contributes to adaptation to environmental/host niches and to pathogenicity. In an early oral S. enterica QH infection, the levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes significantly reduce in peripheral blood of mice, but the increasing transcription levels of some cytokines (IFN-β1, IFN-γ and CXCL10) might have pleiotypic immune effects against S. enterica QH infection. Of note, IL10 displays significant enhancement at levels of transcription and translation, suggesting that immunosuppressive effects mediated by IL10 may function as an early oral S. enterica QH infection. The systemic investigations, including genomic and genetic characterizations and biological traits of S. enterica QH in vivo and in vitro may reflect the basic lifestyle of S. enterica QH, requiring intestine colonization, undergoing environmental stresses and performing dissemination.",3
Antiretroviral therapy increases rates of tuberculosis across a broad range of CD4 strata.,antiretroviral therapy AND tuberculosis AND CD4 strata AND immune reconstitution,"41187210,29547445,41187123","[PMID: 41187210] Diagnostic tests that can detect pre-clinical or sub-clinical infection, are one of the most powerful tools in our armoury of weapons to control infectious diseases. Considerable effort has been paid to improving diagnostic testing for human, plant and animal diseases, including strategies for targeting the use of diagnostic tests towards individuals who are more likely to be infected. We use machine learning to assess the surrounding risk landscape under which a diagnostic test is applied to augment its interpretation. We develop this to predict the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis incidents in cattle herds, exploiting the availability of exceptionally detailed testing records. We show that, without compromising test specificity, test sensitivity can be improved so that the proportion of infected herds detected improves by over 5 percentage points, or 240 additional infected herds detected in one year beyond those detected by the skin test alone. We also use feature importance testing for assessing the weighting of risk factors. While many factors are associated with increased risk of incidents, of note are several factors that suggest that in some herds there is a higher risk of infection going undetected.

[PMID: 29547445] To assess incidence, determinants and clinical consequences of suboptimal immune recovery in HIV-1 infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa with sustained viral suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Multicountry prospective cohort. Suboptimal immune recovery was defined as proportions of participants who failed to attain clinically relevant CD4+ cell count thresholds (>200, >350 and >500 cells/μl) despite sustained viral suppression on continuous first-line ART. Participants were censored at the earliest of death, loss to follow-up, last viral load less than 50 copies/ml, or database closure. Determinants of immune recovery were assessed using multivariable Cox regression. We estimated incidence rates of AIDS, pulmonary tuberculosis and all-cause mortality for CD4+ strata. One thousand, five hundred and ninety-two participants were included; 60% were women, median age was 37 years (IQR 31-43) and median pre-ART CD4+ cell count was 147 cells/μl (IQR 76-215). After 6 years of ART, suboptimal immune recovery at CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/μl, less than 350  cells/μl, and less than 500 cells/μl occurred in 7, 27, and 57% of participants, respectively. Compared with participants with CD4+ cell count greater than 500 cells/μl, on-ART incidence rates were 12.5, 4.1, 0.9 times higher for AIDS and 16.9, 3.5, and 2.3 times higher for pulmonary tuberculosis in participants with CD4+ cell count less than 200, 200-349, and 350-499 cells/μl, respectively. All-cause mortality was highest in participants with CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells/μl, and comparable across the higher CD4+ strata. Older age, male sex, and lower pre-ART CD4+ cell count were strongly associated with suboptimal immune recovery. These findings warrant close clinical and laboratory monitoring until adequate immune reconstitution is achieved and support early ART initiation before decline of CD4+ cell count.

[PMID: 41187123] Tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) is increasingly offered to people living with HIV in high-burden settings, including adolescents and young people (AYPLHIV). Evidence demonstrates that AYPLHIVs' HIV treatment engagement is improved by the provision of tailored support. How to effectively adapt this support to accommodate multimorbidity care, such as TPT alongside ART, warrants attention to deliver sustained optimal outcomes. We conducted qualitative research to better understand AYPLHIVs' experiences when initiating TPT and their related support needs. Peer counsellors (18-24 years) who were offered TPT within routine HIV care participated in two focus groups (n = 16 participants) and in-depth interviews (n = 12) in Harare. Iterative data collection and thematic analysis was conducted September 2023 to February 2024. TPT was presented by healthcare workers as uncomplicated and routine. This contrasted with participants' accounts of the significant disruptive and challenging experience of taking up TPT. This tension led many to stop TPT without support. Those who completed treatment were motivated by personal circumstances (e.g., recently witnessing severe TB illness, pregnancy); however, taking up and completing subsequent courses of TPT was not assured. TPT side effects and stigma led many to discontinue treatment, even when these were not personally experienced. Side effects recalled past experiences of HIV-stigma and discrimination, and undermined ART adherence, HIV viral suppression, and positive mental health. Introducing additional life-protecting treatments can have complicating biosocial effects, with consequences for individuals and public health. To support multimorbidity prevention and care, we outline five principles to guide initiating and maintaining treatment that acknowledges and responds to AYPLHIVs' dynamic immunological and social realities: Supported and safe relationships; Tailored messaging; Adaptable support; Respect for agency and autonomy; Timing: plan, review, revise (START). START emphasises investing in consistent peer support throughout adolescence, and centring AYPLHIVs' agency, embodied knowledge and wellbeing to ensure they are informed decision-makers about their health.",3
Asymptomatic visual impairment screening in elderly populations leads to improved vision.,asymptomatic visual impairment AND elderly populations AND vision screening AND improved vision,"9522788,35597227,41187325","[PMID: 9522788] To assess whether population screening for impaired vision among older people in the community leads to improvements in vision. Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of population screening in the community that included any assessment of vision or visual function with at least 6 months' follow up. Adults aged 65 or over. Proportions with visual impairment in intervention and control groups with any method of assessing visual impairment. There were no trials that primarily assessed visual screening. Outcome data on vision were available for 3494 people in five trials of multiphasic assessment. All the trials used self reported measures for vision impairment, both as screening tools and as outcome measures. The inclusion of a visual screening component in the assessment did not result in improvements in self reported visual problems (pooled odds ratio 1.04:95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.22). A small reduction (11%) in the number of older people with self reported visual problems cannot be excluded. Screening of asymptomatic older people in the community is not justified on present evidence. Visual impairment in this age group can usually be reduced with treatment. It is unclear why no benefit was seen. Further work is needed to clarify what interventions are appropriate for older people with unreported impairment of vision.

[PMID: 35597227] Worldwide, glaucoma affects about 3% of the population over the age of 50 years and is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment among older people. Because glaucoma is asymptomatic in its early stages and can be challenging to diagnose clinically, it often remains undiagnosed until substantial vision loss has occurred. Efficient methods of glaucoma screening are therefore warranted for early detection of disease. Identification of risk factors for glaucoma - family history of glaucoma, older age, African or Asian ethnicities, raised intraocular pressure, and thin corneas - have helped inform guidelines on the recommended age at commencement and frequency of glaucoma screenings. A genetic predisposition or family history of glaucoma is one of the most important risk factors for the disease. However, an accurate family history cannot always be ascertained. Genetic testing for genes such as myocilin could help to identify high-risk individuals and, with further research, could even provide insight into individual patients' response to treatment. With the ongoing discovery of glaucoma-associated genes and the advent of polygenic risk scores to identify individuals at high risk of glaucoma, gene-based screening for glaucoma is becoming closer to realisation. In the meantime, regularly screening family members of people with existing glaucoma is an efficient way of detecting early glaucoma. Raising public awareness of glaucoma is also necessary to educate the general public on the key role of routine eye examinations and early disease detection. Future studies should be undertaken to explore efficient public health campaign methods for improving glaucoma awareness.

[PMID: 41187325] Strabismus measurement is essential in vision assessment and screening. It typically requires skilled clinicians or specialized equipment. Photographic strabismus measurement methods have value in terms of accessibility and convenience of use. This study aimed to evaluate Eyeturn Cloud, a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) system for measuring strabismus angles based on eye images captured with smartphone cameras under cover test conditions. The Eyeturn Cloud web app uses AI models to recognize eyes, eye lid, and iris, and then to segment iris precisely. It then computes strabismus based on ellipse fitting of the iris boundary and corneal reflection. The system was evaluated in patients (without glasses) with manifest strabismus and control participants. Clinicians measured eye deviations using the prism alternate cover test and also captured pictures of their eyes under alternate cover and unilateral cover conditions. The pictures were processed by Eyeturn Cloud. In total, 79 (mean age 11.9, SD 6.3 years; esotropia: n=15, exotropia: n=55, orthotropia: n=9) participants were enrolled; of which, data were available for 71 participants (8/79, 10.1% processing failure). The range of prism alternate cover test strabismus magnitude was from 78 base in to 78 base out prism diopters (PDs). A strong correlation was found between Eyeturn Cloud and clinical measurements (R<sup>2</sup>=0.95; slope=0.91; P<.001). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that 95% limits of agreement between the 2 measurements were -20.2 to 14.6 PD. A repeatability test with 15 participants (4 photos each) found a 1.53 PD SD. The cloud AI web app can compute strabismus angles reliably under alternate and unilateral cover conditions in clinical settings, and its potential for use in telehealth settings needs further evaluation.",3
Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance.,autophagy deficiency AND liver AND insulin resistance AND metabolism,"40659123,38772366,40195072","[PMID: 40659123] Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common and severe complication of diabetes. Despite the availability of several drugs for the treatment of DN, there remains a need for novel therapeutic agents with more favorable risk profiles. Asiaticoside (AT) and asiatic acid (AA), two bioactive constituents derived from Centella asiatica, have exerted excellent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of AT and AA on DN remains unclear. To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AT and AA on DN in mice, a high-fat diet- and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice model was constructed to induce DN symptoms. AT and AA were then administered for 6 weeks to determine their impact on the progression of DN. The results indicated that AT and AA treatment improved insulin resistance and lipid metabolism while reducing inflammation in the liver and adipose tissue of DN mice. Additionally, AT and AA protected kidney function and alleviated kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Mechanistically, AT and AA mitigated podocyte damage by activating autophagy, and these effects were abrogated after autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine in vitro. AT and AA treatment protected gut barrier function, altered microbial composition and metabolites, and resulted in a reciprocal increase in beneficial bacteria and metabolites and a decrease in harmful ones. In summary, AT and AA administration ameliorated the progression of DN by activating podocyte autophagy and regulating microbiota dysbiosis, laying a theoretical basis for the nutritional intervention of AT and AA in DN.

[PMID: 38772366] Adipose tissue group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) help maintain metabolic homeostasis by sustaining type 2 immunity and promoting adipose beiging. Although impairment of the ILC2 compartment contributes to obesity-associated insulin resistance, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here, we found that ILC2s in obese mice and humans exhibited impaired liver kinase B1 (LKB1) activation. Genetic ablation of LKB1 disrupted ILC2 mitochondrial metabolism and suppressed ILC2 responses, resulting in exacerbated insulin resistance. Mechanistically, LKB1 deficiency induced aberrant PD-1 expression through activation of NFAT, which in turn enhanced mitophagy by suppressing Bcl-xL expression. Blockade of PD-1 restored the normal functions of ILC2s and reversed obesity-induced insulin resistance in mice. Collectively, these data present the LKB1-PD-1 axis as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disease.

[PMID: 40195072] Previous studies demonstrated that Tspo loss causes simple steatosis (SS) in hepatocytes in vitro. However, its effect on SS in vivo remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesise that Tspo loss promotes early-stage MASLD. WT and Tspo KO rats were fed a Gubra Amylin NASH (GAN) diet for 8 weeks to induce SS. Tspo KO rats fed the GAN diet (KO GAN) exhibited increased insulin resistance, higher plasma cholesterol, and elevated hepatic triacylglycerol (TAG) levels, along with higher de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and free fatty acid (FFA) uptake, evidenced by increased fatty acid synthase (FASN) and CD36 expression. The Acyl-coenzyme A binding protein/diazepam-binding inhibitor-TSPO complex facilitated FA transport to the mitochondria, where carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) directed them for β-oxidation. TSPO interacted with CPT1A in the outer mitochondrial membrane, while its depletion increased CPT1A expression, boosting FA oxidation. Primary Tspo KO rat hepatocytes and stably overexpressed CD36 (CD36_OE) in Huh7 cells displayed impaired mitochondrial function and compromised mitochondrial membrane potential. KO GAN livers had significantly elevated AcCoA, which acetylated RAPTOR, activating mTORC1 to suppress autophagy. Overall, Tspo deficiency exacerbates the advancement of SS by enhancing CD36-mediated FFA uptake, elevating AcCoA levels, compromising mitochondrial function and impairing autophagy during the early stages of MASLD.",3
BCL-2 promotes the apoptotic effects of c-Myc.,BCL-2 AND c-Myc AND apoptosis AND apoptotic effects,"41085796,40649963,40204952","[PMID: 41085796] Zataria multiflora (ZM) is a medicinal plant with widespread antitumor effects. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are considered the mainstay treatment in blood cancers; however, eventual resistance to TKIs poses a significant challenge in this area. The present study aimed to assess the synergistic effects of ZM extract (ZME) along with imatinib, a TKI, against K-562 and U-266 leukemic cell lines. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay, and apoptosis assessment was also conducted through Annexin-V/PI staining. Additionally, Real-Time PCR was used to assess the expression levels of BCR-ABL, P-TEN, c-MYC, Bax, and Bcl-2 genes. Molecular docking was carried out as an in-silico technique for both BCL-2 and ABL proteins. The results showed that both ZME and imatinib promoted apoptosis in K562 and U266 cells, with combination treatment significantly enhancing apoptotic cell death (e.g., 18.4% apoptosis in K562 cells with ZME + imatinib vs. 8.5% untreated; 46.9% in U266 cells vs. 11.6% untreated, P < 0.05). Combined treatment with imatinib and ZME upregulated the expression of Bax (5-fold in K562, 3-fold in U266) and P-TEN (2-fold in K562, 2.8-fold in U266) genes and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 (0.3-fold in K562, 0.3-fold in U266), BCR-ABL (0.5-fold in K562), and c-MYC (0.4-fold in K562, 0.2-fold in U266) genes (P < 0.05). Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities between ZME constituents (carvacrol and thymol) and BCL-2 and ABL proteins. ZME shows potential as a complementary agent in vitro, warranting further investigation.

[PMID: 40649963] Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains challenging to treat despite multimodal therapeutic approaches. Cisplatin treatment is effective and cost-efficient, although chemoresistance and disease recurrence limit its efficacy. Understanding the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance and the identification of compounds to target resistant tumor cells are critical for improving patient outcomes. We have demonstrated that cisplatin-induced senescent HN30 HNSCC cells can be eliminated by ABT-263 (navitoclax), a BCL-2/BCL-X<sub>L</sub> inhibitor that has senolytic properties. Here, we report the development of a cisplatin-resistant cell line (HN30R) for the testing of ABT-263 and the PROTAC BET degraders ARV-825 and ARV-771. ABT-263 was ineffective in sensitizing HN30R cells to cisplatin, largely due to a lack of senescence induction. However, the BET degraders in combination with cisplatin promoted apoptotic cell death in both HN30 and HN30R cells. The effectiveness of ARV-825 did not appear to depend on the cells entering into senescence, indicating that it was not acting as a conventional senolytic. ARV-825 treatment downregulated BRD4 and its downstream targets, c-Myc and Survivin, as well as decreased the expression of RAD51, a DNA repair marker. These results suggest that the BET degraders ARV-825 and ARV-771 may be effective in improving the response of chemoresistant head and neck cancer to cisplatin treatment.

[PMID: 40204952] The landmark discovery of the BCL-2 gene and then its function marked the identification of inhibition of apoptotic cell death as a crucial novel mechanism driving cancer development and launched the quest to discover the molecular control of apoptosis. This work culminated in the generation of specific inhibitors that are now in clinical use, saving and improving tens of thousands of lives annually. Here, some of the original players of this story, describe the sequence of critical discoveries. The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, frequently observed in follicular lymphoma, allowed the identification and the cloning of a novel oncogene (BCL-2) juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus (IgH). Of note, BCL-2 acted in a distinct manner as compared to then already known oncogenic proteins like ABL and c-MYC. BCL-2 did not promote cell proliferation but inhibited cell death, as originally shown in growth factor dependent haematopoietic progenitor cell lines (e.g., FDC-P1) and in Eμ-Myc/Eμ-Bcl-2 double transgenic mice. Following a rapid expansion of the BCL-2 protein family, the Abbott Laboratories solved the first structure of BCL-XL and subsequently the BCL-XL/BAK peptide complex, opening the way to understanding the structures of other BCL-2 family members and, finally, to the generation of inhibitors of the different pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, thanks to the efforts of Servier/Norvartis, Genentech/WEHI, AbbVie, Amgen, Prelude and Gilead. Although the BCL-2 inhibitor Venetoclax is in clinical use and inhibitors of BCL-XL and MCL-1 are undergoing clinical trials, several questions remain on whether therapeutic windows can be achieved and what other agents should be used in combination with BH3 mimetics to achieve optimal therapeutic impact for cancer therapy. Finally, the control of the expression of BH3-only proteins and pro-survival BCL-2 family members needs to be better understood as this may identify novel targets for cancer therapy. This story is still not concluded!",3
Bariatric surgery leads to negative outcomes in mental health.,bariatric surgery AND depression AND anxiety AND complications,"40611087,40111296,41085909","[PMID: 40611087] The prevalence of impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and some mental health complications, such as anxiety and depression, were previously reported to be higher in cases with obesity. However, the prevalence and changes before and after metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) are less well-defined in various populations of individuals with severe obesity. In this prospective study, the status of HRQOL, anxiety, and depression symptoms of 32 cases with severe obesity who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were investigated one month before and one year after surgery. The assessments were performed through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-lite (IWQOL-Lite) questionnaires. One year after surgery, Patients' average body mass index (BMI) decreased significantly by 9.14 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: -10.76; -7.52. At baseline, the incidence rates of probable/possible anxiety or depression disorders were 65.6% and 46.9%, respectively. However, these symptoms did not improve significantly after surgery. In contrast, HRQOL scores significantly improved across all domains. The point prevalence of mental health complications appears to be relatively higher among patients who underwent MBS compared to the general population. While the surgery effectively reduced weight and improved the HRQOL of patients, the impact on anxiety and depression was insignificant. Due to the small sample size, especially the limited number of patients with abnormal HADS scores, these findings should be interpreted cautiously.

[PMID: 40111296] Bariatric surgery is recognized as the most effective method for patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) or complicated obesity (BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/m² with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for at least one year). This article aims to examine the evolution of mental health after the procedure. Anxiety-depressive disorders and binge eating usually decrease within two years post-surgery. However, studies show an increased risk of alcohol or substance use disorders after surgery. Additionally, there has been an increase in self-harming and suicidal behaviors. In conclusion, bariatric surgery should be part of a personalized, multidisciplinary approach to ensure the best benefit-risk ratio for each patient.

[PMID: 41085909] Eating disorders among children and adolescents occur in all body sizes and must be properly identified and treated across settings for optimal health outcomes. This review summarizes considerations for behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical obesity treatment and eating disorder risk. Obesity and eating disorders share many common risk factors. Yet adolescents with obesity and eating disorders are underrepresented in research studies and often remain undiagnosed in medical practice despite presenting with more severe symptoms. There is evidence for reduction of subclinical disordered eating attitudes and behaviors in health behavior and lifestyle trials, with emerging evidence of reductions in subclinical disordered behaviors (i.e., loss of control eating) for patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. There is a paucity of eating disorder screening and monitoring data reported in pharmacological trials. Psychosocial outcomes, including subclinical eating disordered attitudes and behaviors, suicidality risk, and symptoms of depression and anxiety, should be continuously monitored prior to and throughout obesity treatment. There are several validated measures to detect symptoms of disordered eating among youth with higher weights. Early detection of eating disorder symptoms among obesity treatment-seeking youth is imperative to inform the course of comorbid treatment to occur simultaneously, sequentially, or within specialty care. Adolescents with obesity are at greater risk for engaging in disordered eating and related worsened mental and physical health outcomes compared to peers without obesity. It is vital to assess for eating disorder symptoms and presentation to inform timely treatment.",3
Bariatric surgery reduces colorectal cancer.,bariatric surgery AND colorectal cancer AND reduction AND risk,"37969715,37341934,40002265","[PMID: 37969715] Colorectal cancer ranks third in global cancer prevalence and stands as the second leading cause of cancer-related mortalities. With obesity recognized as a pivotal risk factor for colorectal cancer, the potential protective role of bariatric surgery, especially laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, has garnered attention. To investigate the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) <i>vs</i> sleeve gastrectomy (SG) effect on colorectal cancer incidence in obese individuals. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Seventeen studies with a total of 12497322 patients were included. The primary outcome was the relative risk (RR) of developing colorectal cancer in obese patients who underwent weight loss surgery compared to those who did not. Secondary outcomes included determining the RR for colon and rectal cancer separately and subgroup analyses by gender and type of weight loss surgery. The meta-analysis revealed a 54% reduction in colorectal cancer risk in morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared to those who did not. A significant 46% reduction in colorectal cancer risk was observed among female patients. However, no significant differences were found in the meta-analysis for various types of bariatric surgery, such as SG and RYGB. This meta-analysis reveals weight loss surgery, regardless of type, reduces colorectal cancer risk, especially in women, as indicated by RR and hazard ratio assessments. Further validation is essential.

[PMID: 37341934] Cancer and obesity represent two of the most significant global health concerns. The risk of malignancy, including colorectal cancer (CRC), increases with obesity. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the value of bariatric surgery in reducing CRC risk in patients with obesity using registry data. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per PRISMA guidelines. The risk of CRC was expressed as a dichotomous variable and reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel-Haenszel method. A multi-treatment comparison was performed, examining the risk reduction associated with existing bariatric surgery techniques. Analysis was performed using RevMan, R packages, and Shiny. Data from 11 registries including 6,214,682 patients with obesity were analyzed. Of these, 14.0% underwent bariatric surgery (872,499/6,214,682), and 86.0% did not undergo surgery (5,432,183/6,214,682). The mean age was 49.8 years, and mean follow-up was 5.1 years. In total, 0.6% of patients who underwent bariatric surgery developed CRC (4,843/872,499), as did 1.0% of unoperated patients with obesity (54,721/5,432,183). Patients with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery were less likely to develop CRC (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36-0.77, P < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 99%). Patients with obesity undergoing gastric bypass surgery (GB) (OR: 0.513, 95% CI: 0.336-0.818) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (OR: 0.484, 95% CI: 0.307-0.763) were less likely to develop CRC than unoperated patients. At a population level, bariatric surgery is associated with reduced CRC risk in patients with obesity. GB and SG are associated with the most significant reduction in CRC risk. CRD42022313280.

[PMID: 40002265] <b>Introduction</b>: Obesity is a chronic disease associated with increased risk for several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The majority of CRC cases are associated with modifiable risk factors. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is a proven, durable, and successful intervention for obesity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of MBS on CRC risk through measures of association, such as relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR). <b>Methods</b>: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Embase was conducted to identify systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses examining the relationship between obesity treated with MBS and CRC incidence. The PICO framework guided inclusion criteria, and three independent reviewers screened articles using Rayyan software. Quality assessment was performed using AMSTAR2. <b>Results</b>: Of 1336 screened articles, 10 SR met inclusion criteria, encompassing 53,452,658 patients. Meta-analyses consistently showed a significant reduction in CRC risk following MBS in patients with severe obesity. Risk reductions were reported by Liu et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.32-0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.01), Chierici et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.28-0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.018), Wilson et al. (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.003), and Pararas et al. (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. For colon cancer, Liu and Chierici both reported an RR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.46-1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.2444) with significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 89%). A trend towards reduced rectal cancer risk (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.40-1.39, <i>p</i> = 0.3523) was noted but limited by fewer studies. Sex-specific analyses revealed protective effects in both sexes, with a more pronounced impact in females (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.37-0.79, <i>p</i> = 0.0014). <b>Conclusions</b>: This umbrella review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of MBS on CRC risk, highlighting a consistent protective association. The findings also indicate a potential risk reduction for both colon and rectal cancer, with a more pronounced effect observed among females compared to males. Given the profound implications of MBS on cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, further high-quality, long-term studies are essential to deepen our understanding and optimize its role in cancer prevention and patient care.",3
Bariatric surgery reduces postmenopausal breast cancer.,bariatric surgery AND breast cancer AND postmenopausal AND risk reduction,"41124824,40599584,40552446","[PMID: 41124824] Obesity is a complex, progressive and relapsing chronic disease associated with significant medical complications, such as breast cancer. Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective treatment modality for obesity. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the incidence of breast cancer in those who underwent bariatric surgery, as well subgroup analysis focusing on the effect of menopausal status in this cohort. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, involving the search of databases including Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, Pubmed and Google Scholar. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (Revman) Version 5.4. A total of 2,288,003 patients with obesity were included in the analysis. There was a statistically significant risk reduction in breast cancer incidence in those who underwent bariatric surgery compared to those who did now (RR 0.58 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.46, 0.72, p < 0.001) across all fourteen studies. There was significant heterogeneity across the studies (Chi<sup>2</sup> = 358 p < 0.00001, I<sup>2</sup> = 96 %). Further subgroup analysis was performed on four of the included studies regarding the impact of menopausal status on breast cancer incidence. There was no statistically significant reduction in premenopausal breast cancer risk (RR 0.88 95 % CI 0.74, 1.04). The result was similar in the postmenopausal cohort (RR 0.46 CI 95 % 0.18, 1.19). This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that bariatric surgery is associated with a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer incidence by pathways alluded to in this review and likely by a number of mechanisms yet to be fully elucidated. The role of menopausal status on breast cancer incidence in those who undergo bariatric surgery remains unclear.

[PMID: 40599584] Both obesity and diabetes are associated with increased risk for specific types of cancer, generally termed obesity-related cancer (ORC). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS) are well established treatments for diabetes and obesity, but their comparative effectiveness for the prevention of ORC is unknown. Here, we compare the incidence of ORC in adults living with obesity and diabetes who were treated with first-generation GLP-1RA or with BMS. An observational, retrospective cohort study based on electronic medical records data of Clalit health services, Israel. The study included patients aged ≥24 years, with obesity and diabetes, with no prior history of ORC, who received either of the interventions during 2010 through 2018. Overall, 3178 pairs were matched 1:1 based on sex, age, baseline BMI, time of treatment initiation, and smoking status. The study period extended from January 2010 until December 2023. The measured outcome was the incidence of ORC, defined as any of the following diagnoses: multiple myeloma, meningioma, adenocarcinoma of esophagus; stomach, colorectal, liver or bile duct, gallbladder, pancreas, corpus uteri, ovary, renal-cell kidney, thyroid, and postmenopausal breast cancer. Of the 6356 study participants, 3884 (61.1%) were females. At baseline, the mean age was 52.3 years (SD: 9.28), and the mean BMI was 41.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD: 5.10). Participants were followed for a median of 7.5 years and up to 12.9 years. ORC occurred in 5.62 cases per 1000 person-years in BMS patients, and in 5.89 cases per 1000 person-years in GLP-1Ra patients; adjusted HR for GLP1-RA versus BMS 1.11 (95% CI: 0.86-1.44). Moreover, assessment of mediation through weight-loss resulted in an estimated direct effect of 41% (95% CI: 15%-59%) relative risk reduction of the pharmacotherapy. Our finding suggest that first-generation GLP1-RA treatment does not increase ORC risk in patients receiving GLP1-RA treatment for diabetes and weight loss. Moreover, this may point at additional pathways beyond weight loss in which GLP-1RAs might contribute to the decreased risk for ORC, such as reducing inflammation. However, future studies, including randomized controlled trials and larger prospective cohort studies are needed to validate the observed effects and explore the underlying mechanisms. No financial or in-kind support was provided for the conduct of this study.

[PMID: 40552446] Obesity and breast cancer rates are increasing globally, with obesity prevalence more than doubling since 1990. By 2022, 44% of women were overweight, and 18% were obese. Breast cancer remains the most common malignancy among women, with 2.2 million new cases in 2020. A significant proportion of breast cancer patients are overweight or obese at diagnosis, which is associated with higher recurrence and mortality rates. Recently, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have emerged as remarkably effective weight loss drugs. Understanding the relationship between obesity, breast cancer, and weight loss is crucial for improving patient outcomes. A comprehensive review of literature from 1996 to 2024 was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science. Studies included epidemiological data on obesity and breast cancer incidence, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical trials on weight management interventions (behavioral modification, bariatric surgery, and pharmacological treatments) for breast cancer patients. Preclinical studies examining the biological mechanisms linking obesity and breast cancer progression were also reviewed. Epidemiological studies consistently show that overweight and obese post-menopausal women have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Obesity at diagnosis is linked to worse outcomes, including higher disease recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. Weight gain during treatment, particularly with chemotherapy, is common and often leads to sarcopenic obesity. Behavioral interventions have shown modest weight loss but are difficult to maintain. Bariatric surgery reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but lacks data on its impact on tumor characteristics and recurrence. GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide have demonstrated significant weight loss in non-cancer populations, but their safety and efficacy in breast cancer patients are not well established. The biology underlying obesity's role in breast cancer progression involves complex interactions between adipocytokines, hormones, and inflammatory cytokines. Weight loss interventions have potential benefits, but sustaining weight reduction in breast cancer patients is challenging. The emerging pharmacological treatments, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists, show promise for effective weight management but require further investigation to confirm their safety and impact on breast cancer outcomes. Addressing obesity in breast cancer patients is critical for improving prognosis and quality of life. While current data do not suggest adverse safety signals with GLP-1 receptor agonists, more research is needed to fully understand their effects. Effective, safe, and sustainable weight management strategies are urgently needed to support breast cancer patients.",3
CD44v6 is not associated with constitutive and reprogrammed cancer stem cells driving cancer metastasis.,CD44v6 AND Cancer stem cells AND Metastasis AND Association studies,"35117466,31947887","[PMID: 35117466] CD44 is a marker for colorectal cancer (CRC) stem cells (CCSCs), but its prognostic value remains controversial. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the expression profile of CD44 variants in CRC. The proto-oncogene mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (c-Kit) was previously found to play an important role in supporting CRC cells; however, the associations between c-Kit and CD44 (and its splice variants) remain largely unknown. A total of 148 patients with CRC were enrolled in the present study, and the levels of CD44, CD44 splice variant (v)3, CD44v6 and c-Kit were examined by immunohistochemical staining. Associations between these markers and clinicopathological parameters, as well as the extent to which these markers predict progression free-survival (PFS), were analyzed. A total of 29 (19.6%), 60 (40.5%) and 66 (44.6%) patients were CD44-, CD44v3- and CD44v6-positive, respectively. No clear c-Kit-positivity was detected in any of the patients. Analyses of clinicopathological features indicated that positive expression of CD44v3 was significantly associated with cell differentiation (P=0.03), and N (P=0.04), M (P<0.01) and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages (P<0.01). Univariate analysis demonstrated that T, N, M and TNM stages (all P<0.01), and CD44 (P<0.01), CD44v3 (P=0.03) and CD44v6 (P=0.02) levels were significantly associated with PFS. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that patients without CD44 expression (P<0.01) but with CD44v3 (P=0.04) and CD44v6 (P=0.02) expression exhibited significantly shortened PFS. CD44, CD44v3 and CD44v6 were determined to be heterogeneously expressed in CRC, and may aid in the prognostic prediction of patients with this disease.

[PMID: 31947887] CD44 is widely expressed in most vertebrate cells, whereas the expression of CD44v6 is restricted to only a few tissues and has been considered to be associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Thus, CD44v6 has been recognized as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for various cancers for more than a decade. However, despite many experimental studies, the structural dynamics and differences between CD44s and CD44v6, particularly in their stem region, still remain elusive. Here, a computational study was conducted to address these problems. We found that the stem of CD44s adopted predominantly two conformations, one featuring antiparallel β-sheets and the other featuring parallel β-sheets, whereas the stem of CD44v6 adopted mainly one conformation with relatively highly suppressed β-sheet contents. Moreover, Phe215 was found to be essential in the β-sheets of both CD44s and CD44v6. We finally found intramolecular Phe215-Trp224 hydrogen-bonding interactions and hydrophobic interactions with Phe215 that cooperatively drove conformational differences upon the addition of the v6 region to CD44. Our study elucidated the structural differences between the stem regions of CD44s and CD44v6 and thus can offer useful structural information for drug design to specifically target CD44v6 in promising clinical applications.",2

[PMID: 38928011] Adipose tissue is conventionally recognized as a metabolic organ responsible for storing energy. However, a proportion of adipose tissue also functions as a thermogenic organ, contributing to the inhibition of weight gain and prevention of metabolic diseases. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the study of thermogenic fats, particularly brown adipose tissue (BAT). Despite this progress, the mechanism underlying thermogenesis in beige adipose tissue remains highly controversial. It is widely acknowledged that beige adipose tissue has three additional thermogenic mechanisms in addition to the conventional UCP1-dependent thermogenesis: Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling thermogenesis, creatine substrate cycling thermogenesis, and triacylglycerol/fatty acid cycling thermogenesis. This paper delves into these three mechanisms and reviews the latest advancements in the molecular regulation of thermogenesis from the molecular genetic perspective. The objective of this review is to provide readers with a foundation of knowledge regarding the beige fats and a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of this process, which may lead to the development of new strategies for maintaining human health.",3

In addition to its classical role in regulating the cell cycle and tumor proliferation, numerous publications have identified the broad role of EZH2 in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), leading to immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. EZH2 has been shown to silence immune surveillance genes by binding to H3K27me3 histone, leading to epigenetic silencing in lymphomas and thereby reducing tumor immunogenicity, which facilitates immune escape. EZH2 also modulates the recruitment and activity of immunosuppressive cells by epigenetically modifying cytokine and chemokine networks. Importantly, EZH2 upregulates PD-L1 expression either directly or indirectly through its pro-oncogenic activation of STAT3 signaling, which induces T cell exhaustion and ultimately resistance to checkpoint inhibitors in cancers such as breast cancer and glioblastoma. Furthermore, EZH2 also influences the regulation of immune-related microRNAs, including the suppression of the miR-144/451a cluster, which encourages immunosuppressive macrophage polarization. Pharmacological EZH2 inhibition has been shown to be an arm of a synergistic therapy, combining immune checkpoint blockade therapies, which can reinstate antigen presentation and T cell infiltration, highlighting EZH2 as an essential epigenetic modulator of tumor-immune interactions. It remains a viable target for therapy to overcome immune resistance and improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes.

[PMID: 41186886] Procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1) is important for extracellular matrix formation and is involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer; however, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mechanistic importance of PLOD1 as a regulator of GC. We examined the potential function and prognostic efficiency of PLOD1 in GC using a variety of bioinformatics methods. In vitro, we assessed the ability of PLOD1 to regulate GC by CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, and Elisa assay analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of PLOD1 on the immune escape of GC cells by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Elisa assay. Analysis of PLOD1 expression in gastric cancer and other cancers in public databases as well as survival showed that low expression of PLOD1 has better survival, while the AUC area under the ROC curve of this gene showed that this gene has better prognostic value. Meanwhile, the results of correlation analysis between PLOD1 and 60 immune checkpoints showed that the gene was positively correlated with immune checkpoint genes, and one of the genes with the largest correlation was CD276, and the pearson's correlation between PLOD1 and cancer immune cycle was also calculated, and the relationship between PLOD1 and the immune microenvironment was evaluated, and the enrichment of the immune infiltration analysis into a larger number of immune cells among which the importance of PLOD1 was determined. Differential gene analysis was then performed on the gastric cancer dataset, using the differential genes to perform WGCNA network co-expression analysis with the PLOD1 gene, and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed on these differential genes, enriching for cancer-related pathways and cell cycle signaling pathways. Two key genes were then obtained in the analysis with glycolysis, while drug sensitivity analysis was performed, yielding multiple potential drugs such as AZD7545, BRD-K03911514 and BRD-K14844214. Furthermore, in vitro experiments further demonstrated that PLOD1 increased the proliferation and migration ability of GC cells by promoting immune escape. The results of this study suggest that PLOD1 is an important regulator of GC progression and participates in the immune escape process of GC, which is expected to be a potential target for GC treatment.",3
Charcoal is an effective treatment for acute paraquat poisoning.,paraquat AND poisoning AND activated charcoal AND effectiveness,"25253933,23892316,23528512","[PMID: 25253933] Herbicide poisoning is most common method of suicide in India and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Among different herbicidal poisonings the most predominantly found poisonings are paraquat and glyphosate. These compounds are highly toxic and their poisonings require proper management techniques. High fatality is seen in these cases which are mainly due to its inherent toxicity and lack of effective treatment. Common symptoms of these poisonings includes gastrointestinal corrosive effects with mouth and throat, epigastric pain and dysphagia, acid-base imbalance, pulmonary edema, shock and arrhythmia. Long term health effects include pulmonary fibrosis, renal failure, hepatic failure, heart failure, multi-organ failure or death. No proven antidote exists for these poisonings. So the treatment is mainly supportive. Initially gastric lavage or whole-gut irrigation using adsorbents such as Fuller's earth, bentonite or activated charcoal is recommended. In case of renal failure hemodialysis or hemoperfusion may be considered. However novel approaches like treatment with N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C, vitamin E, cyclophosphamide may also be helpful.

[PMID: 23892316] A general synthetic method for functionalization of mesoporous silica with amino acid has been developed. The carboxylic acid functionalized SBA-15 was conjugated with l-phenylalanine (Phe) and l-tryptophan (Trp) to obtain nontoxic amino acid-conjugated functionalized mesoporous silica materials. The materials were used as adsorbents for the removal of the herbicide Paraquat (PQ) and its analog, ethyl viologen dibromide (EVB) from aqueous solutions. In comparison to the commercially available activated carbon adsorbents, the silica-based adsorbents prepared in this study exhibited relatively higher PQ removal efficiency in aqueous solutions at room temperature and pH 7.0. The silica-based adsorbents, pendant with amino acid moieties exhibited greater adsorption capacities toward PQ and EVB than the analogs but without the amino acid moiety, suggesting that there is a benefit for the enhanced π-π interaction between the aromatic groups of the conjugated amino acid moieties and the adsorbate. This bioconjugated method developed here provides a promising new tool to synthesize new materials for detoxification of herbicides in clinical trials.

[PMID: 23528512] This observational study examined the outcome of Taiwanese pediatric patients with paraquat poisoning and compared these data with the published data on paraquat poisonings from other international poisoning centers. We performed a retrospective study on children with acute paraquat poisoning that were admitted to the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital during a period of 10 years (2000-2010). Of the 193 paraquat poisoning patients, only 6 were children. The mean age was 8.85 ± 5.55 (1-15.6) years. Younger patients had accidentally swallowed paraquat, whereas older patients had intentionally ingested paraquat. Most patients were referred within a relatively short period (0.5-2.0 hours). Paraquat poisoning was associated with high morbidity and often resulted in severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure. The complications included shock (50.0%), hypoxemia (33.3%), respiratory failure (33.3%), nausea/vomiting (16.7%), abdominal pain (33.3%), hepatitis (66.7%), gastrointestinal tract bleeding (33.3%), acute renal failure (33.3%), and seizures (16.7%). Patients were treated aggressively with a standard detoxification protocol consisting of gastric lavage, active charcoal, charcoal hemoperfusion, and cyclophosphamide and steroid pulse therapies. Secondary bacterial infections were common after hospitalization and included sepsis (33.3%), pneumonia (33.3%), and urinary tract infection (50.0%). In the end, 2 patients (33.3%) died from multiple-organ failure, despite intensive resuscitation. Our data (mortality rate, 33.3%) are comparable to the data of other published reports from other international poison centers. Evidently, a prompt diagnosis of paraquat poisoning and an immediate institution of a detoxification protocol is a prerequisite for a favorable outcome.",3
Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment decreases brown adipose tissue activity.,Chenodeoxycholic acid AND Brown adipose tissue activity AND Reduction AND Treatment effects,"37122689,27488269","[PMID: 37122689] Although fat loss is observed in patients with cholestasis, how chronically elevated bile acids (BAs) impact white and brown fat depots remains obscure. To determine the direct effect of pathological levels of BAs on lipid accumulation and mitochondrial function, primary white and brown adipocyte cultures along with fat depots from two separate mouse models of cholestatic liver diseases, namely (i) genetic deletion of farnesoid X receptor (<i>Fxr</i>); small heterodimer (<i>Shp</i>) double knockout (DKO) and (ii) injury by 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), were used. As expected, cholestatic mice accumulate high systemic BA levels and exhibit fat loss. Here, we demonstrate that chronic exposure to pathological BA levels results in mitochondrial dysfunction and defective thermogenesis. Consistently, both DKO and DDC-fed mice exhibit lower body temperature. Importantly, thermoneutral (30 °C) housing of the cholestatic DKO mice rescues the decrease in brown fat mass, and the expression of genes responsible for lipogenesis and regulation of mitochondrial function. To overcome systemic effects, primary adipocyte cultures were treated with pathological BA concentrations. Mitochondrial permeability and respiration analysis revealed that BA overload is sufficient to reduce mitochondrial function in primary adipocytes, which is not as a result of cytotoxicity. Instead, we found robust reductions in uncoupling protein 1 (<i>Ucp1</i>), PR domain containing 16 (<i>Prdm16</i>)<i>,</i> and deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II (<i>Dio2</i>) transcripts in brown adipocytes upon treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, whereas taurocholic acid led to the suppression of <i>Dio2</i> transcript. This BA-mediated decrease in transcripts was alleviated by pharmacological activation of UCP1. High concentrations of BAs cause defective thermogenesis by reducing the expression of crucial regulators of mitochondrial function, including UCP1, which may explain the clinical features of hypothermia and fat loss observed in patients with cholestatic liver diseases. We uncover a detrimental effect of chronic bile acid overload on adipose mitochondrial function. Pathological concentration of different BAs reduces the expression of distinct genes involved in energy expenditure, which can be mitigated with pharmacological UCP1 activation.

[PMID: 27488269] Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, and associated pathologies, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular alterations, are increasingly escalating morbidity and mortality. Despite intensive study, no effective simple treatment for these conditions exists. As such, the need for go-to drugs is serious. Bile acids (BAs) present the possibility of reversing these problems, as various in vivo studies and clinical trials have shown significant effects with regard to weight and obesity reduction, insulin sensitivity restoration and cardiovascular improvements. However, the mechanism of action of BA-induced metabolic improvement has yet to be fully established. The currently most accepted model involves non-shivering thermogenesis for energy waste, but this is disputed. As such, we propose to determine whether the BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) can exert anti-obesogenic effects in vitro, independent of thermogenic brown adipose tissue activation. By exposing differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes to high glucose and CDCA, we demonstrate that this BA has anti-obesity effects in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of metabolic pathways clearly indicates an improvement in metabolic status, as these cells become more oxidative rather than glycolytic, which may be associated with an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Our work demonstrates that CDCA-induced metabolic alterations occur in white and brown adipocytes and are not totally dependent on endocrine/nervous system signaling, as thought until now. Furthermore, future exploration of the mechanisms behind these effects will undoubtedly reveal interesting targets for clinical modulation.",2

Over the last three decades, the role of inflammation in atherogenesis has been tested extensively. Although preclinical studies demonstrate a clear role for inflammation in atherogenesis, clinical studies using global anti-inflammatory therapies have not been as successful as hoped, encouraging the search for new therapeutic strategies. Thanks to the advent of cell-specific lineage tracing, we have begun to appreciate the multifaceted role of smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching in modulating plaque stability. Here, we review the mechanisms controlling smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching during early and late-stage pathogenesis, which may inspire future therapies to stabilize plaques.

The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187245] Identifying the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a cornerstone of preventive medical care. Despite its significance, limited research has explored ASCVD risk in individuals with fibrotic skin diseases. This study aims to evaluate the risk of ASCVD in patients diagnosed with fibrotic skin conditions. We utilized the TriNetX platform to analyze ASCVD risk associated with fibrotic skin conditions. Propensity score-matched (PSM) cohorts were constructed to adjust for confounding. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Patients with fibrotic skin diseases demonstrated an elevated risk of ASCVD. Scleroderma was most strongly associated with ASCVD risk (HR 2.51 [95% CI: 1.97,3.21]), followed by hypertrophic scar (HR 1.40 [95% CI: 1.20,1.63]). Elevated risks were also observed for morphea (HR 1.36 [95% CI: 1.03,1.08]) and lichen sclerosis (HR 1.30 [95% CI: 1.04,1.62]). Individuals with fibrotic skin conditions, including scleroderma, hypertrophic scars, morphea, and lichen sclerosis, demonstrate an increased risk of ASCVD. These findings highlight the significance of recognizing fibrotic skin diseases as possible indicators of systemic inflammation.",3
Cognitive behavioral therapy is an ineffective treatment for insomnia,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy AND Insomnia AND Ineffective Treatment AND Scientific Articles,"34393484,31246050","[PMID: 34393484] Chronic insomnia disorder, which affects 6-10% of the population, is diagnostically characterized by ongoing difficulties with initiating or maintaining sleep occurring at least three times per week, persisting for at least 3 months, and associated with daytime impairment. While chronic insomnia is often considered a condition primarily related to impaired sleep, the disorder can also adversely affect domains of physical and mental health, quality of life, and daytime function, which highlights the importance of treating the multidimensional sleep disorder. Owing to misperceptions about the safety and effectiveness of treatment options, many individuals with insomnia may not seek professional treatment, and alternatively use ineffective home remedies or over-the-counter medications to improve sleep. Some physicians may even believe that insomnia is remediated by simply having the patient ""get more sleep"". Unfortunately, treatment of insomnia is not always that simple. The disorder's complex underlying pathophysiology warrants consideration of different nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options. Indeed, recent insights gained from research into the pathophysiology of insomnia have facilitated development of newer treatment approaches with more efficacious outcomes. This narrative review provides a summary of the diagnostic criteria and pathophysiology of insomnia and its subtypes. Further, this review emphasizes new and emerging nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for chronic insomnia, including recent enhancements in approaches to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and the new dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) pharmacologics. These advances in treatment have expanded the treatment options and are likely to result in improved outcomes in patients with chronic insomnia.

[PMID: 31246050] Insomnia and nightmares are central features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, often they are inadequately assessed and ineffectively resolved following gold-standard PTSD treatment. Here we: (a) evaluate effects of prolonged exposure (PE) on subjectively measured sleep and (b) present pilot results of an examination of whether adding sleep interventions (imagery rehearsal therapy [IRT] and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia [CBT-I]) to PE improves treatment response, relative to PE alone, for night- and/or daytime PTSD symptoms among returning U.S. veterans and postdeployment personnel. In a parallel-groups, randomized controlled trial, participants received 12 sessions of PE followed by IRT (5 weeks) and CBT-I (7 weeks) or PE followed by 12 weeks supportive care therapy (SCT). PE did not improve sleep to a clinically meaningful degree, despite significant improvements in both Clinical Administered PTSD Scale and PTSD Checklist. Enhancing treatment with IRT/CBT-I led to greater improvements in insomnia (diary-recorded sleep efficiency) symptoms with large effect size, relative to SCT (<i>p</i> = .068, <i>d</i> = 1.07). There were large improvements in nightmare frequency relative SCT that did not reach statistical significance (<i>p</i> = .11, <i>d</i> = 0.90). Moreover, there was small improvement in daytime symptoms (Clinical Administered PTSD Scale) that did not reach statistical significance (<i>p</i> = .54, <i>d</i> = .31). The addition of targeted, validated sleep treatment improves effects of PE and improves nighttime symptoms. Thus, evidence-based sleep treatment should be considered in comprehensive PTSD treatment.

Converting apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing worsens the pathology associated with apoE4 in human iPSCderived neurons.,ApoE4 AND ApoE3 AND Gene Editing AND Human iPSC-derived Neurons,"29632371,41185093,41185939","[PMID: 29632371] Efforts to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail in human trials, suggesting a pressing need to study AD in human model systems. Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.

[PMID: 41185093] Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the apoE4 isoform (C112R) represents the strongest genetic risk factor. We combined binding-site mapping and discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations to elucidate isoform-specific apoE-Aβ interactions. Computational peptide-array analysis identified Aβ-binding hotspots in the apoE4 N-terminal domain (NTD) around R112, conferring greater Aβ-binding propensity than apoE3. DMD simulations showed that apoE4 NTD is less stable and more solvent-exposed, resulting in stronger Aβ binding, especially near the mutation site. Upon binding apoE NTDs, Aβ exhibited an increased β-sheet content, suggesting a lowered fibril nucleation barrier. Incorporating these insights into a recently established thermodynamic-kinetic framework of amyloid aggregation rationalizes apoE's biphasic effect on Aβ aggregation: apoE retards Aβ fibrillization at low Aβ-concentrations via monomer sequestration but accelerates the process at high concentrations by facilitating nucleation. Our findings offer mechanistic insight into the APOE genotype-dependent modulation of Aβ aggregation and may inform genotype-specific therapeutic strategies for AD.

[PMID: 41185939] Despite the tremendous potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology in precision therapeutics, intracellular delivery remains a major challenge. High cytoplasmic viscosity and lysosomal entrapment significantly impair the cytosolic transport and gene-editing efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate that both the size and magnetic responsiveness of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters can be finely tuned by modulating ionic strength, enabling their rapid propulsion under external magnetic fields. Leveraging this property, we develop magnetic nanoparticle cluster nanorobots (MagCbots) of approximately 200 nm in size by electrostatically assembling Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids. Under magnetic actuation, MagCbots exhibit rapid rotation in highly viscous intracellular environments, achieving a linear velocity of ∼0.41 μm/s. MagCbots reduce intracellular viscosity by approximately 50% and enhance lysosomal escape efficiency by 3-fold compared to nonactuated counterparts. Their porous architecture not only offers high payload capacity but also protects plasmid DNA from enzymatic degradation. Notably, MagCbots enable efficient genome editing of both PD1 and PLK1 genes across various cell lines including hard-to-transfect Jurkat T cells. This magnetically driven nanorobot platform presents a promising strategy for active intracellular delivery and holds significant potential for advancing gene therapy and related biomedical applications.",3
Cytochrome c is transferred from cytosol to the mitochondrial intermembrane space during apoptosis.,cytochrome c AND apoptosis AND mitochondrial intermembrane space AND transfer,"27934682,23347876,21739274","[PMID: 27934682] Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the main source of energy for metabolism. Mitochondria provide the majority of this ATP by a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. This process involves active transfer of positively charged protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane resulting in a net internal negative charge, known as the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm). The proton gradient is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP by fusing adenosine diphosphate and free phosphate. The net negative charge across a healthy mitochondrion is maintained at approximately -180 mV, which can be detected by staining cells with positively charged dyes such as tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). TMRE emits a red fluorescence that can be detected by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy and the level of TMRE fluorescence in stained cells can be used to determine whether mitochondria in a cell have high or low ΔΨm. Cytochrome c is essential for producing ΔΨm because it promotes the pumping the protons into the mitochondrial intermembrane space as it shuttles electrons from Complex III to Complex IV along the electron transport chain. Cytochrome c is released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol during apoptosis. This impairs its ability to shuttle electrons between Complex III and Complex IV and results in rapid dissipation of ΔΨm. Loss of ΔΨm is therefore closely associated with cytochrome c release during apoptosis and is often used as a surrogate marker for cytochrome c release in cells.

[PMID: 23347876] Cyclosporine A (CsA) nephrotoxicity has been linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in renal cells. We have demonstrated that the antioxidant Vitamin E (Vit E) abolished renal toxicity in vivo and in vitro models. As one of the main sources of intracellular ROS are mitochondria, we studied the effects of CsA on several mitochondrial functions in LLC-PK1 cells. CsA induced ROS synthesis and decreased reduced glutathione (GSH). The drug decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and induced physiological modifications in both the inner (IMM) and the outer mitochondrial membranes (OMM). In the IMM, CsA provoked mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) and cytochrome c was liberated into the intermembrane space. CsA also induced pore formation in the OMM, allowing that intermembrane space contents can reach cytosol. Furthermore, CsA altered the mitochondrial dynamics, inducing an increase in mitochondrial fission; CsA increased the expression of dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) that contributes to mitochondrial fission, and decreased the expression of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and optic atrophy protein 1 (Opa1), proteins involved in the fusion process. All these phenomena were related to apoptosis. These effects were inhibited when cells were treated with the antioxidant Vit E suggesting that they were mediated by the synthesis of ROS.

[PMID: 21739274] In valinomycin induced stimulation of mitochondrial energy dependent reversible swelling, supported by succinate oxidation, cytochrome c (cyto-c) and sulfite oxidase (Sox) [both present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (MIS)] are released outside. This effect can be observed at a valinomycin concentration as low as 1 nM. The rate of cytosolic NADH/cyto-c electron transport pathway is also greatly stimulated. The test on the permeability of mitochondrial outer membrane to exogenous cyto-c rules out the possibility that the increased rate of exogenous NADH oxidation could be ascribed either to extensively damaged or broken mitochondria. Accumulation of potassium inside the mitochondria, mediated by the highly specific ionophore valinomycin, promotes an increase in the volume of matrix (evidenced by swelling) and the interaction points between the two mitochondrial membranes are expected to increase. The data reported and those previously published are consistent with the view that ""respiratory contact sites"" are involved in the transfer of reducing equivalents from cytosol to inside the mitochondria both in the absence and the presence of valinomycin. Magnesium ions prevent at least in part the valinomycin effects. Rather than to the dissipation of membrane potential, the pro-apoptotic property of valinomycin can be ascribed to both the release of cyto-c from mitochondria to cytosol and the increased rate of cytosolic NADH coupled with an increased availability of energy in the form of glycolytic ATP, useful for the correct execution of apoptotic program.",3
DUSP4 decreases apoptosis.,DUSP4 AND apoptosis AND regulation AND role,"31258782,33760201,32470454","[PMID: 31258782] <b>Background</b>: Sorafenib appears to increase the survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, but its response rate is seriously limited due to drug resistance. Molecular mechanisms underlying sorafenib resistance are still unknown. Herein, we explored the possible role of miR-1226-3p in sorafenib resistance of HCC. <b>Methods</b>: The miR-1226-3p expression level in HCC cell lines was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Cell viabilities to sorafenib were measured by CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis and proliferation were detected by flow cytometry and EdU proliferation assay. A luciferase reporter of DUSP4 3'-UTR was used for validation as a target gene of miR-1226-3p. Finally, the effects of <i>in vivo</i> antitumor efficacy of miR-1226-3p combined with sorafenib were evaluated by HCC tumor xenografts in nude mice. <b>Results</b>: Bioinformatics analysis from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE56059 suggested that miR-1226-3p expression was downregulated in HCC patients who showed progressive disease (PD) after sorafenib treatment. SK-HEP-1 cells expressed lower levels of miR-1226-3p than HepG2 cells. We confirmed that SK-HEP-1 cells were more resistant to sorafenib compared to HepG2 cells. In addition, miR-1226-3p mimic increased cell apoptosis of SK-HEP-1 cells, whereas miR-1226-3p inhibitor significantly impaired cell apoptosis of HepG2 cells after sorafenib treatment. Moreover, we validated that miR-1226-3p directly targeted dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), and further demonstrated that knockdown of DUSP4 reduced sorafenib resistance by regulating the JNK-Bcl-2 axis. <b>Conclusions</b>: miR-1226-3p promotes sorafenib sensitivity of HCC through downregulation of DUSP4 expression, and targeting miR-1226-3p may be a novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming sorafenib resistance.

[PMID: 33760201] MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play an important role in regulating the occurrence and development of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). miR‑122‑5p is widely considered a tumour inhibitor, which has not been fully explored in PTC. Bioinformatics analysis identified dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), a tumour promoter gene for PTC, as a downstream target of miR‑122‑5p. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of miR‑122‑5p in PTC oncogenesis. In this study, the expression pattern of miR‑122‑5p in PTC cancer tissues and PTC cell lines was investigated via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the roles of miR‑122‑5p in PTC were explored using gain‑of‑function and loss‑of‑function assays. The results revealed that the expression of miR‑122‑5p was significantly lower in PTC cancer tissues, especially in cancer tissues with significant invasion or metastasis. Overexpression of miR‑122‑5p caused by miR‑122‑5p mimics inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of the PTC cell line K1, while knockdown of miR‑122‑5p by miR‑122‑5p inhibitors exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> assays revealed that miR‑122‑5p overexpression inhibited tumour growth. In addition, miR‑122‑5p was negatively correlated with DUSP4 expression in PTC cancer tissues. miR‑122‑5p overexpression inhibited DUSP4 expression in K1 cells, while miR‑122‑5p downregulation produced the inverse effect. Specifically, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding sites of miR‑122‑5p on the 3'‑UTR of DUSP4, demonstrating the targeting effect of miR‑122‑5p on DUSP4. miR‑122‑5p inhibited the oncogenesis of PTC by targeting DUSP4, revealing the potential application value of miR‑122‑5p in the diagnosis and treatment of PTC.

[PMID: 32470454] The aim of this study was to explore the role of miR-122-5p in acute lung injury. Mice were subjected to intratracheal injection of lipopolysaccharide to establish an acute lung injury model. The mice also received miR-122-5p antagonist and mimic via injection to inhibit or overexpress miR-122-5p in the lung tissue, respectively. In an in vitro experiment, we isolated primary mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells and established a cell injury model via lipopolysaccharide treatment. Mice injected with an miR-122-5p antagonist exhibited reduced lung injury, inflammation and oxidative stress, while mice injected with a miR-122-5p mimic exhibited exaggerated lung injury, inflammation and oxidative stress. In an in vitro experiment, we found that the miR-122-5p antagonist suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress. Moreover, miR-122-5p regulated the promoter activity of DUSP4, which negatively regulated ERK1/2 signaling. The use of DUSP4 siRNA counteracted the effects of the miR-122-5p antagonist. Taken together, these results show that miR-122-5p protected against acute lung injury via regulation of DUSP4/ERK signaling in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. MiR-122-5p antagonism may be a promising treatment method for acute lung injury.",3

Decreased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.,decreased diastolic blood pressure AND DBP AND abdominal aortic aneurysm AND AAA,"41186511,41185995,41184674","[PMID: 41186511] Hysteroscopic myomectomy is a common procedure for treating submucosal leiomyomas, but fluid overload and subsequent pulmonary edema are significant complications. This study investigates whether phenylephrine-induced increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) can reduce pulmonary edema and distension fluid absorption in patients undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 44 patients scheduled for hysteroscopic myomectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either phenylephrine infusion to maintain MAP at 100%-120% of the baseline value or normal saline infusion during surgery. The primary outcome was the incidence of pulmonary edema assessed by lung ultrasound (LUS). Secondary outcomes included B-line scores, thoracic fluid content (TFC), distension fluid deficit, use of furosemide, and so on. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed in distention fluid deficit, andΔTFC to predict pulmonary edema. The phenylephrine group showed a significantly lower incidence of pulmonary edema (18.2% vs. 54.6%, RR = 0.33, 95%CI [0.13 to 0.81], P = 0.027) and lower LUS B-line scores (MD = - 4.5, 95%CI [0 to 9], P = 0.016) compared to the control group. Additionally, the phenylephrine group had significantly reduced distension fluid deficit (P = 0.018), lower TFC at the end of operation (P = 0.008), and decreased use of furosemide (P = 0.022). Best cut-off value in diagnosis pulmonary edema were 1900 ml for distention fluid deficit, and 7.1/kΩ for ΔTFC and area under the ROC curve were 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. Phenylephrine administration during hysteroscopic myomectomy effectively reduces pulmonary edema and distension fluid absorption by increasing MAP. This study provides evidence for a new strategy in intraoperative fluid management for hysteroscopic surgeries.

[PMID: 41185995] Ang II (angiotensin II) causes hypertension and vascular inflammation both directly and indirectly via cytokines, including TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α). In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), Ang II and TNFα activate Nox1 (NADPH oxidase 1) to produce superoxide. TNFα receptors associate with Nox1 and LRRC8A (leucine-rich repeat containing 8A) anion channels to modulate inflammation and contractility in a RhoA-dependent manner. VSMC-specific LRRC8A knockout mesenteric arteries are protected from TNFα-induced injury, and vasodilation is preserved. We hypothesized that LRRC8A knockout would preserve vascular function and decrease blood pressure (BP) in Ang II-infused mice. Wild-type and knockout mice received Ang II infusions for 14 days. BP was measured by radiotelemetry, and aortic and mesenteric artery function was measured by wire myography. VSMCs were isolated from male wild-type and knockout mice. Systolic BP was not different, but knockout mice had more BP dipping during inactive periods at baseline, and dipping was preserved after Ang II. The function of knockout aortic and mesenteric vessels was less impaired by Ang II, as reflected by less augmented contraction to norepinephrine and serotonin and preserved relaxation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Western blotting revealed increased soluble guanylate cyclase alpha and reduced CPI-17 in hypertensive knockout aortae. Consistent with lower Rho kinase activity, phosphorylation of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) and cofilin was reduced in knockout VSMCs. Ang II caused less proliferation (lower PCNA [proliferating cell nuclear antigen]) and less induction of senescence in knockout vessels. LRRC8A anion channels support VSMC inflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction, which impairs BP dipping in hypertension.

[PMID: 41184674] Robotic surgery demands specialized training to ensure proficiency and patient safety. Deliberate practice using Virtual Reality (VR) robotic simulation platforms provides a safe method for skill acquisition. The first part of our Initial curriculum (IC) consisted of 33 VR drills on the SimNow Simulator, which was refined in 2021 to 19 VR drills using a Simulation-Based Mastery Learning (SBML) approach. This study evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of our refined curriculum (RC). A total of 87 general surgery residents were included. IC was completed by 41 residents, while 46 residents completed the RC. Metrics such as console time, pre- and post-test VR drill scores, and inanimate drill performance were assessed. Statistical analyses included independent or paired t-tests and Mann-Whitney U, or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests for non-parametric data. In the IC, 83% of participants achieved mastery versus 100% in the RC. Mean console training time was significantly reduced from 7 h 6 m (95% CI: 6.20-7.92) in the IC to 5 h 42 m (95% CI: 4.74-6.10) in the RC (p = 0.005), demonstrating enhanced efficiency. For VR drills, the IC median score improved from 62 (126-28) to 353 (366-317) (p < 0.001), with a median time reduction of 847 s (1169-565) (p < 0.001). In the RC, the median test score improved from 65.5 (138.75-37.75) to 344.5 (365.5-291.25) (p < 0.001), with a median time reduction of 999 s (1449.5-548.25) (p < 0.001). Inanimate drill times also improved: the IC median time decreased from 928.5 s (1066-853.5) to 741.5 s (859-613.5) (p < 0.001), while the RC median time decreased from 909.5 s (1037.7-744.7) to 464.5 s (518-413.7) (p < 0.001). Reducing VR drills from 33 to 19 content-aligned drills with new proficiency benchmarks maintained effectiveness while significantly decreasing VR console training time. These findings support the feasibility of implementing this streamlined robotic training curriculum in general surgery residency programs without compromising skill acquisition.",3
Deltex has no known interactions with eIF3f.,Deltex AND eIF3f AND interaction AND protein,"41187330,41187365,41187361","[PMID: 41187330] Oral health is essential for children's overall well-being, yet dental caries remain a significant global health issue. Gamification has gained attention as an innovative approach to improving children's oral health by enhancing engagement and promoting behavior change. Although previous studies have examined different aspects of gamification in pediatric oral health, no review has addressed it as a comprehensive framework encompassing education, behavior change, engagement, and digital platforms. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in pediatric oral health management, focusing on game design elements; intervention platforms; and outcomes such as oral hygiene knowledge, behavior, and engagement. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO), identifying studies from January 1, 2014, to February 9, 2025. The review included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and qualitative studies with measurable outcomes that focused on gamified interventions for children's oral health. A standardized form was used to collect study details, interventions, demographics, outcomes, and risk of bias. Data synthesis was conducted using a narrative approach due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. The synthesis focused on identifying common themes, evaluating intervention effectiveness, and highlighting methodological strengths and limitations. In total, 41 studies were reviewed, and most (n=24, 59%) used digital interventions such as mobile apps, serious games, and augmented reality. Game elements such as rewards, progress tracking, and interactive feedback were commonly used to enhance user engagement and improve health outcomes. The effect of the digital-based interventions was generally positive, with 38% (9/24) of the studies reporting improvements in oral health knowledge and behaviors. In nonexperimental studies, gamified interventions demonstrated substantial improvements in parental engagement and awareness of oral health practices, which translated into better brushing habits and increased preventive dental visits. Digital-based interventions were more effective in fostering long-term behavior change compared to nondigital alternatives. Engagement metrics revealed higher participation rates in gamified interventions, with improved adherence to oral hygiene routines. However, most studies (39/41, 95%) exhibited moderate risk of bias, including self-reported data and potential selection biases. This review synthesized findings from 41 studies on gamification in children's oral health. Gamification, particularly mobile apps and augmented reality, has potential to significantly enhance pediatric oral health management by increasing engagement, improving oral hygiene behaviors, and promoting sustained health behavior change. Future research should explore the long-term effects of these interventions, develop culturally adaptive tools, and integrate gamification with existing public health programs to maximize their impact.

[PMID: 41187365] Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) as one of the most important fields of chemometrics provides useful information in pharmaceutical chemistry, drug design, toxicology, and other related areas. In this study, a QSAR model was developed employing image pixels of molecular structure as descriptors to describe the antibacterial activity of pleuromutilin derivatives. Accordingly, a dataset of 54 Pleuromutilin derivatives was collected from the literature, plotted, and transformed into pixels using MATLAB software to generate the desired model. The data were pre-processed through mean-centering and scaling to optimize pixel selection. The suitable descriptors were then extracted using principal component analysis (PCA) and the final model was built followed by partial least squares (PLS) multivariate calibration. The developed QSAR model was validated and novel compounds with antibacterial properties were suggested. In addition, molecular docking studies were utilized to investigate inhibitory activities of proposed new compounds against ribosomal protein (PDB ID: 3G4S). The findings showed high potential of proposed compounds to form strong interactions with key active site residues, confirming their good antibacterial activity and the validity of constructed QSAR model for drug prediction.

Most of the Th17 cells are lost within 2 weeks from infection at mucosal sites of SIV-infected macaques and are not replenished over time. Comparison of simian pathogenic and nonpathogenic models of SIV infection suggests that Th17 cells contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS. Th17 cells, a recently identified subset of T helper cells, play a major role in both inducing autoimmune disorders and fencing off extracellular pathogens. Several groups have reported that the number of Th17 cells is decreased in the gut of HIV-infected and SIV-infected hosts. The loss of Th17 cells from the mucosal compartment has been associated with the dissemination of Salmonella typhimurium that is normally contained locally by the host immune system. It is believed that microbial translocation sustains immune activation in HIV infection and contributes to AIDS. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to disruption of mucosal integrity, viral spread, and chronic immune activation is of crucial importance for the design of efficient vaccines and therapeutic intervention for HIV.

Here we show that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in depletion of T helper type 17 (TH17) cells in the ileal mucosa of rhesus macaques, thereby impairing mucosal barrier functions to S. typhimurium dissemination. In SIV-negative macaques, the gene expression profile induced by S. typhimurium in ligated ileal loops was dominated by TH17 responses, including the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-22. TH17 cells were markedly depleted in SIV-infected rhesus macaques, resulting in blunted TH17 responses to S. typhimurium infection and increased bacterial dissemination. IL-17 receptor-deficient mice showed increased systemic dissemination of S. typhimurium from the gut, suggesting that IL-17 deficiency causes defects in mucosal barrier function. We conclude that SIV infection impairs the IL-17 axis, an arm of the mucosal immune response preventing systemic microbial dissemination from the gastrointestinal tract.

[PMID: 41184436] Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) causes approximately 155 000 deaths annually and poses significant risks to both human and animal health. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in NTS is a growing global public health threat. Using a One Health approach, this study investigated NTS in swine, poultry, and wastewater in Gauteng Province, South Africa. From May 2019 to August 2020, 507 samples were collected, including animal faeces (n = 388), hand swabs (n = 104), abattoir and farm run-off (n = 10), and hospital (n = 1) and municipal wastewater (n = 4). Whole genome sequencing of recovered isolates revealed a 2.37% (12/507) NTS prevalence, identifying four serovars: Salmonella Enteritidis sequence type (ST) 11 (n = 3), S. Infantis ST32 (n = 4), S. Irumu ST2026 (n = 2), and multidrug-resistant S. Typhimurium monophasic variant 1,4,[5],12:i:- ST34 (n = 3). The ST34 strains, detected in swine, exhibited ASSuT (ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline) resistance pattern and marked the first detection of ST34 from an animal source in Africa. The strains harboured a novel sopE-phage (AmTI) and SGI-4. Phylogenetic analysis linked these strains to human cases in South Africa and the UK, which could indicate transmission of MDR S. Typhimurium between animals and humans, underscoring the importance of enhanced AMR surveillance using a One Health approach.",3
Diabetes remission occurs more in people treated with conventional therapy than in people treated with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery.,diabetes remission AND conventional therapy AND laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding AND bariatric surgery,"41187097,20059345,16249543","[PMID: 41187097] To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline. Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities. This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.

[PMID: 20059345] Several gastrointestinal (GI) operations that were designed to promote weight loss can powerfully ameliorate type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although T2DM is traditionally viewed as a chronic, relentless disease in which delay of end-organ complications is the major treatment goal, GI surgery offers a novel endpoint: complete disease remission. Ample data confirm the excellent safety and efficacy of conventional bariatric operations-especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding-to treat T2DM in severely obese patients. Use of experimental procedures as well as conventional bariatric operations is increasingly being explored in less obese diabetic patients, with generally favorable results, although further assessment of risk:benefit profiles is needed. Mounting evidence indicates that certain operations involving intestinal diversions improve glucose homeostasis through varied mechanisms beyond reduced food intake and body weight, for example by modulating gut hormones. Research to elucidate such mechanisms should facilitate the design of novel pharmacotherapeutics and dedicated antidiabetes GI manipulations. Here we review evidence regarding the use and study of GI surgery to treat T2DM, focusing on available published reports as well as results from the Diabetes Surgery Summit (DSS) in Rome and the World Congress on Interventional Therapies for T2DM in New York City.

[PMID: 16249543] Lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes in obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and conventional diet (No-LAGB) in the prevention (primary intervention study; 56 vs. 29 patients) and remission (secondary intervention study; 17 vs. 20 patients) of type 2 diabetes and hypertension in grade 3 obesity in a 4-year study. The subjects (n = 122; age 48.5 +/- 1.05 years; BMI 45.7 +/- 0.67 kg/m2) underwent a diagnostic workup, including psychological and psychiatric assessments, in preparation for the LAGB procedure. Of the 122 subjects, 73 had the surgery (LAGB group). The control group (No-LAGB group) consisted of the 49 subjects who refused the surgery but agreed to be followed up; 6 of these subjects dropped out by the 2nd year of the study, so that the final number of patients was 73 and 43 in the LAGB and No-LAGB groups, respectively. All patients had a yearly visit and oral glucose tolerance test. From baseline to the end of the 4-year follow-up, BMI decreased from 45.9 +/- 0.89 at baseline to 37.7 +/- 0.71 kg/m2 in the LAGB group and remained steady in the No-LAGB group (from 45.2 +/- 1.04 to 46.5 +/- 1.37 kg/m2), with no significant differences between the primary and secondary intervention groups. In the primary intervention study, five of the No-LAGB subjects (17.2%) and none of the LAGB subjects (0.0%; P = 0.0001) progressed to type 2 diabetes; in the secondary intervention study, type 2 diabetes remitted in one No-LAGB patient (4.0%) and seven LAGB patients (45.0%; P = 0.0052). Hypertension occurred in 11 No-LAGB patients (25.6%) and 1 LAGB patient (1.4%; P = 0.0001) and remitted in 1 No-LAGB (2.3%) and 15 LAGB patients (20.5%; P = 0.0001). A study of body mass composition revealed a significant reduction of fat mass and a transitory, but not significant, decrease of fat-free mass in LAGB patients. In morbid obesity, sustained and long-lasting weight loss obtained through LAGB prevents the occurrence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and decreases the prevalence of these disorders.",3
Diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome experience decreased short-term and long-term risk for bleeding events.,diabetic patients AND acute coronary syndrome AND bleeding risk AND scientific articles,"40268181,39650149,40869614","[PMID: 40268181] Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or aspirin resistance are exposed to recurrent atherothrombotic events after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Aspirin once-daily can allow the recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase activity before the next intake in these patients. Twice-daily administration provides more stable inhibition of platelet aggregation and may improve prognosis in these patients. To demonstrate the superiority of twice-daily aspirin compared to once daily in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with DM or aspirin resistance after ACS. The ANDAMAN trial is a randomized, multicenter study including patients (aged ≥18 years) with DM or with aspirin resistance defined as: (1) index event occurring under aspirin; (2) body mass index ≥27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); (3) increased waist circumference (≥88 cm for women or ≥ 102 cm for men). The patients will be recruited in 39 centers after an ACS (with or without ST elevation) with at least one significant coronary stenosis and will be randomized before hospital discharge between twice-daily vs once daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg bid vs od). The primary composite endpoint will be the occurrence of MACE including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, urgent coronary revascularization or acute arterial thrombotic event during a follow-up of 18 months. To achieve a 20% reduction in the relative risk of MACE in the twice-daily aspirin group, a total of 2,574 patients will be included in the trial. The main secondary endpoint will be major bleeding (type 3-5 following BARC classification). The trial will evaluate the prognostic impact of twice-daily aspirin for ACS patients with DM or aspirin resistance and may change the way aspirin is administered to these patients.

[PMID: 39650149] Diabetes mellitus (DM) promotes atherosclerosis, leading to increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Diabetics represent a challenging subset of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a subset characterized by higher rates of recurrent ischemic events compared with non-diabetics. These events are caused by both patient-related accelerated atherosclerotic disease progression and worse stent-related adverse clinical outcomes translating into a higher risk for repeat revascularization. In addition, DM is paradoxically associated with an increased risk of major bleeding following PCI or an ACS. Secondary prevention therapies following PCI or an ACS in diabetic patients are therefore of paramount importance. This mini review focuses on the currently available evidence regarding short- and long-term secondary prevention treatments for diabetic patients undergoing PCI or who have experienced an ACS.

[PMID: 40869614] <b>Background:</b> Reduced-dose prasugrel is widely used in East Asia for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but real-world data in diverse Asian populations are limited. This study evaluated its effectiveness and safety in Taiwanese patients. <b>Methods:</b> The PROMISE-TW Registry was a multicenter, retrospective study including 1167 patients with ACS or chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) treated with reduced-dose prasugrel (20 mg loading, 3.75 mg maintenance) across 13 hospitals in Taiwan from 2018 to 2022. The primary endpoint was 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs: cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke). Secondary outcomes included composite ischemic events and major bleeding (BARC 3-5). <b>Results:</b> Among enrolled patients (mean age 63.9 years; 81.2% male; 83% ACS), percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 90.8%. At one year, MACEs occurred in 1.9%, composite ischemic events in 8.2%, and major bleeding in 0.8%. Subgroup analysis identified prior stroke, diabetes, and chronic total occlusion intervention as predictors of bleeding. Male sex, chronic kidney disease, and left circumflex artery intervention predicted higher ischemic risk. <b>Conclusions:</b>Reduced-dose prasugrel provided effective ischemic protection and low bleeding rates in Taiwanese patients, especially those with ACS. These findings support the clinical utility of dose-adjusted prasugrel in East Asian populations and highlight the importance of individualized risk assessment.",3
Differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells is skewed upon activation of insulin signaling.,progenitor cells AND differentiation AND myeloid cells AND insulin signaling,"38761374,36481320,36475519","[PMID: 38761374] Phagocytic macrophages are crucial for innate immunity and tissue homeostasis. Most tissue-resident macrophages develop from embryonic precursors that populate every organ before birth to lifelong self-renew. However, the mechanisms for versatile macrophage differentiation remain unknown. Here, we use in vivo genetic and cell biological analysis of the Drosophila larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland that produces macrophages. We show that the developmentally regulated transient activation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD)-mediated DNA strand breaks in intermediate progenitors is essential for macrophage differentiation. Insulin receptor-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling regulates the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1)/c-Jun kinase (JNK) axis to control sublethal levels of caspase activation, causing DNA strand breaks during macrophage development. Furthermore, caspase activity is also required for embryonic-origin macrophage development and efficient phagocytosis. Our study provides insights into developmental signaling and CAD-mediated DNA strand breaks associated with multifunctional and heterogeneous macrophage differentiation.

[PMID: 36481320] Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome caused by defects in the repair of DNA inter-strand crosslinks and manifests as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. FA also causes defects in mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) function, but how different FA gene mutations alter function remains understudied. We compared the growth, differentiation and transcript profile of a single MSC isolate from an asymptomatic patient with FA with a FANCG nonsense mutation who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 10 years prior to that from a representative healthy donor (HD). We show that FANCG<sup>-/-</sup> MSCs exhibit rapid onset of growth cessation, skewed bi-lineage differentiation in favor of adipogenesis and increased cellular oxidate stress consistent with an aging-like phenotype. Transcript profiling identified pathways related to cell growth, senescence, cellular stress responses and DNA replication/repair as over-represented in FANCG<sup>-/-</sup> MSC, and real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed these MSCs expressed reduced levels of transcripts implicated in cell growth (TWIST1, FGFR2v7-8) and osteogenesis (TWIST1, RUNX2) and increased levels of transcripts regulating adipogenesis (GPR116) and insulin signaling. They also expressed reduced levels of mRNAs implicated in HSC self-maintenance and homing (KITLG, HGF, GDNF, PGF, CFB, IL-1B and CSF1) and elevated levels of those implicated in myelodysplasia (IL-6, GDF15). Together, these findings demonstrate how inactivation of FANCG impacts MSC behavior, which parallels observed defects in osteogenesis, HSC depletion and leukemic blast formation seen in patients with FA.

[PMID: 36475519] The co-stimulatory CD40-CD40L dyad plays an important role in chronic inflammatory diseases associated with aging. Although CD40 is mainly expressed by immune cells, CD40 is also present on adipocytes. We aimed to delineate the role of adipocyte CD40 in the aging hematopoietic system and evaluated the effects of adipocyte CD40 deficiency on cardiometabolic diseases. Adult adipocyte CD40-deficient mice (AdiCD40KO) mice had a decrease in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (Lin-Sca+cKit+, LSK) and common lymphoid progenitors, which was associated with increased bone marrow adiposity and T-cell activation, along with elevated plasma corticosterone levels, a phenotype that became more pronounced with age. Atherosclerotic AdiCD40koApoE-/- (CD40AKO) mice also displayed changes in the LSK population, showing increased myeloid and lymphoid multipotent progenitors, and augmented corticosterone levels. Increased T-cell activation could be observed in bone marrow, spleen, and adipose tissue, while the numbers of B cells were decreased. Although atherosclerosis was reduced in CD40AKO mice, plaques contained more activated T cells and larger necrotic cores. Analysis of peripheral adipose tissue in a diet-induced model of obesity revealed that obese AdiCD40KO mice had increased T-cell activation in adipose tissue and lymphoid organs, but decreased weight gain and improved insulin sensitivity, along with increased fat oxidation. In conclusion, adipocyte CD40 plays an important role in maintaining immune cell homeostasis in bone marrow during aging and chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly of the lymphoid populations. Although adipocyte CD40 deficiency reduces atherosclerosis burden and ameliorates diet-induced obesity, the accompanying T-cell activation may eventually aggravate cardiometabolic diseases.",3

We found no significant differences in AMH levels or other parameters (such as age, BMI, FSH, AFC) between women who became pregnant and those who did not. Cumulative pregnancy rates and logistic regression analysis revealed that AMH ≥ 1.1 ng/mL was not predictive of ds-IUI success. While a high positive correlation was observed between AFC and AMH (r = 0.67, p < 0.001), ROC curve analyses indicated that neither of these ovarian reserve markers accurately forecasts cumulative ds-IUI outcomes in non-infertile women. The findings of this multicenter study suggest that AMH is not a reliable predictor of pregnancy in non-infertile women undergoing ds-IUI. Even women with low AMH levels can achieve successful pregnancy outcomes, supporting the notion that diminished ovarian reserve should not restrict access to ds-IUI treatments in eligible non-infertile women.

[PMID: 41186868] Intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) in sperm cells plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including motility, capacitation, and fertilization. While previous studies have shown a positive correlation between sperm pH<sub>i</sub> and fertilization success in normozoospermic patients undergoing fertility treatments, its role in non-normozoospermic individuals is unclear. This study investigates the relationship between sperm pH<sub>i</sub> and fertilization outcomes in patients undergoing assisted reproduction techniques: in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Qualitative sperm pH<sub>i</sub> evaluation was performed using time-lapse flow cytometry, and both basal pH<sub>i</sub> and pH<sub>i</sub> response capacity (delta pH<sub>i</sub>) were assessed in sperm samples from patients diagnosed with teratozoospermia, asthenoteratozoospermia, or hypoteratozoospermia. Our results revealed significant differences in pH<sub>i</sub> values among diagnostic groups and specific correlation patterns according to the ART used. In ICSI cycles, higher basal pHi values and reduced delta pH<sub>i</sub> were significantly associated with higher fertilization rates in patients with teratozoospermia, while in IVF, the correlations were more variable. These findings suggest that measuring sperm pH<sub>i</sub> could potentially serve as a valuable tool for predicting fertilization success and guiding treatment decisions during assisted reproduction techniques (ART), contributing to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying male infertility.",3
Early patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) screening increases in-hospital mortality.,Patent Ductus Arteriosus AND Screening AND Early Detection AND In-Hospital Mortality,"40702444,40451810,40055075","[PMID: 40702444] Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common major congenital anomalies, accounting for approximately one-third of all birth defects. They significantly contribute to morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. This study provides insights into the prevalence, characteristics, and management challenges of CHDs in The Gambia, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis, risk factor identification, and improved cardiac care infrastructure. To determine the prevalence, management strategies, and outcomes of CHDs in children at Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital from January 2020 to December 2022. This retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study reviewed medical records of pediatric patients admitted to Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital, the main referral center in The Gambia and the teaching hospital for the University of The Gambia Medical School. Patient data from January 2020 to December 2022 were analyzed. A total of 89 patients were included, with 57.3% (n = 51) females and 42.7% (n = 38) males. The median age was 1.4 years. The most common ethnic group was Mandinka, followed by Fula. Diagnosis was confirmed by using 2D trans-thoracic echocardiography, which was performed on most of the patients (84.3%) in addition to clinical features and chest X-ray. The most prevalent CHD was ventricular septal defect (VSD) (39.3%), followed by atrial septal defect (ASD) (20.2%), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (16.9%), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (10.1%) were also not uncommon. 15.7% of cases were unclassified. The most commonly associated clinical condition among these children with congenital heart disease was Down syndrome (18.0%), predominantly observed in children born to mothers aged over 35 years. This finding underscores the known association between advanced maternal age and chromosomal abnormalities. Maternal diabetes (2.2%) and osteogenesis imperfecta (2.2%) were also noted as less frequent but relevant associated risk factors, highlighting the multifactorial nature of congenital heart disease. Two (2.2%) had a positive family history of congenital heart disease. However, in 65(73%) of cases, there were no associated conditions or family history of CHD. The most frequently used medication in the treatment of these children was furosemide, and heart failure was the most common complication. Surgical interventions were rare: only 2.2% of these children underwent defect closure and 2.2% had pulmonary artery banding, while 95.5% of them did not receive any form of surgical treatment. Seventy-three (82.0%) were discharged and followed up in the clinic, while 6 (6.7%) died. VSD was the most common congenital heart disease observed in this study, with a median age at diagnosis of 1.4 years (95% Confidence Interval: within 12 to 60 months). Down syndrome with maternal age > 35 years was the most frequent associated condition, and heart failure was the leading complication and primary cause of death. While both pharmacological and surgical treatment mode were used, surgical intervention for treatment of these defects remains unavailable in The Gambia, highlighting the urgent need to develop local paediatric cardiac surgery services.

[PMID: 40451810] Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a prevalent congenital cardiac anomaly in neonates. It is characterized by substantial hemodynamic alterations owing to large shunt volumes and is referred to as hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA). hsPDA incidence is notably elevated in preterm infants, who are consequently at increased risk of severe organ complications and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of early echocardiographic parameters combined with platelet indices for predicting the persistence of hsPDA at 14 days postnatally. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 120 very-low-birth-weight infants admitted to Zhongshan People's Hospital between May 2020 and August 2023, dividing them into the hsPDA (n = 46) and non-hsPDA (n = 74) groups based on echocardiography and clinical outcomes at 14 days. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified the PDA diameter and left atrium-to-aorta ratio (LA/AO) as independent risk factors for persistent hsPDA, whereas the platelet distribution width (PDW) index emerged as a protective factor. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) values for the parameters of PDA diameter (0.7769, with a cut-off value of 2.81), LA/AO ratio (0.8964, with a cut-off value of 1.465), and PDW (0.7521, with a cut-off value of 15.58) were calculated. Meanwhile, the combination of these three parameters achieved the highest diagnostic efficiency (AUC = 0.9222). In summary, echocardiographic parameters, particularly the PDA diameter and LA/AO ratio, in conjunction with the PDW index, are effective predictors of persistent hsPDA in preterm infants. These findings offer valuable insights for the early clinical diagnosis of this condition.

[PMID: 40055075] Identifying clinical risk factors that may forecast the development of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very and extremely premature infants can assist clinicians in implementing early interventions to reduce long-term morbidity and mortality rates. A cohort study of enrolled preterm neonates born before the gestational age (GA) of 32 weeks was performed between May 2018 and January 2022. Clinical parameters and comorbidities were gathered retrospectively from medical records and compared among different BPD severity levels based on the diagnostic definition of the 2019 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development criteria. Random forest models were used to rank the importance of clinical variables independently for severe BPD development. A total of 134 preterm infants were enrolled and then divided into three groups based on their BPD severity. Unlike infants with no or mild BPD, the GA, birth weight, and Apgar score at 5 min were considerably lower in preterm infants with severe BPD (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of preterm infants born before GA 28 weeks revealed that only birth weight was significantly lower in those with severe BPD (P = 0.001). Furthermore, sepsis rates were significantly higher in extremely preterm infants with severe BPD (P < 0.001). Using random forest analysis, sepsis, birth weight, and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) appeared to have the highest importance for severe BPD in extremely premature infants. Lower birth weight, sepsis, and the presence of PDA all play important roles in the development of severe BPD in extremely preterm infants.",3
Enhanced early production of inflammatory chemokines damages viral control in the lung.,chemokines AND inflammatory response AND early production AND lung viral infection,"37304302,39381601,36106692","[PMID: 37304302] Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) can suppress intractable inflammation, such as that in rheumatoid arthritis, and is used for treating more than 10,000 rheumatoid arthritis patients annually in Europe. Several recent clinical trials have reported that LDRT can effectively reduce the severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other cases of viral pneumonia. However, the therapeutic mechanism of LDRT remains unelucidated. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying immunological alterations in influenza pneumonia after LDRT. Mice were irradiated to the whole lung 1 day post-infection. The changes in levels of inflammatory mediators (cytokines and chemokines) and immune cell populations in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF), lungs, and serum were examined. LDRT-treated mice displayed markedly increased survival rates and reduced lung edema and airway and vascular inflammation in the lung; however, the viral titers in the lungs were unaffected. Levels of primary inflammatory cytokines were reduced after LDRT, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) levels increased significantly on day 1 following LDRT. Levels of chemokines increased from day 3 following LDRT. Additionally, M2 macrophage polarization or recruitment was increased following LDRT. We found that LDRT-induced TGF-β reduced the levels of cytokines and polarized M2 cells and blocked immune cell infiltration, including neutrophils, in BALF. LDRT-induced early TGF-β production was shown to be a key regulator involved in broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity in virus-infected lungs. Therefore, LDRT or TGF-β may be an alternative therapy for viral pneumonia.

[PMID: 39381601] Primary atopic disorders (PAD) are monogenic disorders caused by pathogenic gene variants encoding proteins that are key for the maintenance of a healthy skin barrier and a well-functioning immune system. Physicians face the challenge to find single, extremely rare PAD patients/families among the millions of individuals with common allergic diseases. We describe case scenarios with signature PAD. We review the literature and deduct specific clinical red flags for PAD detection. They include a positive family history and/or signs of pathological susceptibility to infections, immunodysregulation, or syndromic disease. Results of conventional laboratory and most immunological lab studies are not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of PAD. In the past, multistep narrowing of differential diagnoses by various immunological and other laboratory tests led to testing of single genes or gene panel analyses, which was a time-consuming and often unsuccessful approach. The implementation of whole-genomic analyses in the routine diagnostics has led to a paradigm shift. Upfront genome-wide analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS) will shorten the time to diagnosis, save patients from unnecessary investigations, and reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose a rational, clinical landmark-based approach for deciding which cases pass the filter for carrying out early WGS. WGS result interpretation requires a great deal of caution regarding the causal relationship of variants in PAD phenotypes and absence of proof by adequate functional tests. In case of negative WGS results, a re-iteration attitude with re-analyses of the data (using the latest data base annotation)) may eventually lead to PAD diagnosis. PAD, like many other rare genetic diseases, will only be successfully managed, if physicians from different clinical specialties and geneticists interact regularly in multidisciplinary conferences.

[PMID: 36106692] SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus, causing the global pandemic of respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The type I interferon (IFN) pathway is of particular importance for anti-viral defense and recent studies identified that type I IFNs drive early inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, facilitating viral entry by intranasal recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) transduction of hACE2 in wildtype (WT) and type I IFN receptor-1 deficient (Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> ) mice, to study the role of type I IFN signalling and innate immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that type I IFN signalling is essential for inducing anti-viral effector responses to SARS-CoV-2, control of virus replication, and to prevent enhanced disease. Furthermore, hACE2-Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> mice had increased gene expression of the chemokine Cxcl1 and airway infiltration of neutrophils as well as reduced and delayed production of monocyte-recruiting chemokine CCL2. hACE2-Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed altered recruitment of inflammatory myeloid cells to the lung upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a shift from Ly6C<sup>+</sup> to Ly6C<sup>-</sup> expressing cells.

Exercise increases cancer mortality rates among Chinese citizens.,Exercise AND cancer mortality AND Chinese population AND physical activity,"39843619,40505553,40509832","[PMID: 39843619] Adults living with overweight or obesity do not represent a single homogenous group in terms of mortality and disease risks. The aim of our study was to evaluate how the associations of adulthood overweight and obesity with mortality and incident disease are modified by (i.e., differ according to) self-reported childhood body weight categories. The sample comprised 191,181 men and 242,806 women aged 40-69 years (in 2006-2010) in the UK Biobank. The outcomes were all-cause mortality, incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and incident obesity-related cancer. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate how the associations with the outcomes of adulthood weight status (normal weight, overweight, obesity) differed according to perceived body weight at age 10 years (about average, thinner, plumper). To triangulate results using an approach that better accounts for confounding, analyses were repeated using previously developed and validated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for childhood body weight and adulthood BMI, categorised into three-tier variables using the same proportions as in the observational variables. In both sexes, adulthood obesity was associated with higher hazards of all outcomes. However, the associations of obesity with all-cause mortality and incident CVD were stronger in adults who reported being thinner at 10 years. For example, obesity was associated with a 1.28 (1.21, 1.35) times higher hazard of all-cause mortality in men who reported being an average weight child, but among men who reported being a thinner child this estimate was 1.63 (1.53, 1.75). The ratio between these two estimates was 1.28 (1.17, 1.40). There was also some evidence that the associations of obesity with all-cause mortality and incident CVD were stronger in adults who reported being plumper at 10 years. In genetic analyses, however, there was no evidence that the association of obesity (according to the adult PRS) with mortality or incident CVD differed according to childhood body size (according to the child PRS). For incident obesity-related cancer, the evidence for effect modification was limited and inconsistent between the observational and genetic analyses. Greater risks for all-cause mortality and incident CVD in adults with obesity who perceive themselves to have been a thinner or plumper than average child may be due to confounding and/or recall bias.

[PMID: 40505553] The impact of healthy lifestyles on epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and mortality in middle-aged/ senior populations remains unclear. This study investigates associations between lifestyle factors, EAA biomarkers, and mortality risk. The 2532 adults of 50 years or older that registered in NHANES between 1999-2002.This study evaluated compares first- to third-generation epigenetic clocks (HannumAge, HorvathAge, PhenoAge, GrimAge2, DunedinPoAm) in predicting mortality risk associations between five lifestyle domains (diet, abdominal adiposity, physical activity, smoking, alcohol) and EAA were analyzed via multivariable regression, with mediation models testing EAA's role in lifestyle-mortality relationships. Survival curves results identified DunedinPoAm, GrimAge2AA, and PhenoAgeAA as robust biomarkers of accelerated biological aging, independent of chronological age. In multivariable linear regression models, full adherence to healthy behaviors reduced GrimAge2AA by β = -5.55 years, PhenoAgeAA by β = -2.64 years, and DunedinPoAm by β = -0.06 SD, with smoking cessation demonstrating the strongest GrimAge2AA attenuation (10.17 years). Stratified analyses revealed pronounced benefits: cancer patients adhering to healthy diets (β = -0.04 SD, P for interaction = 0.01) and hypertensive individuals reducing smoking (β = -0.05 SD, P for interaction = 0.04) showed significant EAA mitigation. The sensitivity analysis is consistent with the original results. Mediation analyses indicated GrimAge2AA accounted for 63.58% of lifestyle-survival associations, DunedinPoAm (44.63%) and PhenoAgeAA (28.45%). These findings suggest that comprehensive adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors is associated with reduced epigenetic aging, supporting their potential utility as targets for mortality risk mitigation. And emphasize the utility of epigenetic clocks in precision gerontology.

[PMID: 40509832] To explore the prospective association between physical activity level and mortality risk in Chinese adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Based on the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) who had COPD at the baseline survey, this study employed the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the prospective associations between the overall physical activity, different intensities (low-level, moderate-to-vigorous-level), and types (occupational, non-occupational) of physical activity level and the risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality, such as vascular diseases, cancer, and respiratory diseases. Based on the quintiles of physical activity level, participants were divided into five groups (Q1-Q5), with the lowest quintile group (Q1) as the reference group. Hazard ratio (<i>HR</i>) and 95% confidence interval (95%<i>CI</i>) were calculated for the remaining. In our study, we also performed sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including age, gender, self-rated health status, severity of COPD, <i>etc</i>. Among 33 588 COPD patients at the baseline survey, 8 314 (22.2%) deaths were documented during an average follow-up of (11.1±3.1) years. Negative linear associations between the overall physical activity level and mortality risk from all-cause, vascular, and respiratory diseases were observed (<i>P</i> trend for linear correlation being < 0.001, 0.002, < 0.001). Compared with the lowest quintile group of total physical activity (Q1), the hazard ratios (<i>HR</i>) and 95% confidence intervals (<i>CI</i>) for all-cause mortality, vascular disease mortality, and respiratory disease mortality in the highest quintile group (Q5) were 0.77 (0.70, 0.85), 0.77 (0.65, 0.91), and 0.58 (0.48, 0.71), respectively. The low-level and moderate-to-vigorous-level physical activity were negatively associated with all-cause mortality in the COPD patients (<i>P</i> trend for linear correlation: 0.002, < 0.001, respectively). Compared with the lowest quintile group of low-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (Q1), the <i>HRs</i> (95%<i>CI</i>) for all-cause mortality in the highest quintile group (Q5) were 0.89 (0.82, 0.97) and 0.79 (0.72, 0.87), respectively. The occupational and non-occupational physical activity were also found to have a linear inverse association with all-cause mortality risk among the COPD patients (<i>P</i> trend < 0.001 and 0.015, respectively). Compared with the lowest quintile group of occupational and non-occupational physical activity (Q1), the <i>HR</i> (95%<i>CI</i>) for all-cause mortality in the highest quintile group (Q5) were 0.69 (0.61, 0.78) and 0.91 (0.84, 0.98), respectively. The associations between overall physical activity and all-cause mortality risk were stronger for patients aged 60 and above, female, and who reported poor health status (<i>P</i> for interaction: 0.028, 0.012, 0.010). The protective effect of total physical activity was also applicable to the COPD patients of varying severity. Physical activity could reduce the mortality risk in a dose-response relationship among COPD patients, regardless of its intensity and type, especially among individuals aged 60 and above, females, and those with poor self-report health status.",3
Exposure to fine particulate air pollution is unrelated to anxiety prevalence.,fine particulate air pollution AND PM2.5 AND anxiety prevalence AND associations between,"38805229,31553231,31460967","[PMID: 38805229] Growing evidence associates air pollution exposure with various psychiatric disorders. However, the importance of early-life (eg, prenatal) air pollution exposure to mental health during youth is poorly understood, and few longitudinal studies have investigated the association of noise pollution with youth mental health. To examine the longitudinal associations of air and noise pollution exposure in pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence with psychotic experiences, depression, and anxiety in youths from ages 13 to 24 years. This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort founded in 1991 through 1993 in Southwest England, United Kingdom. The cohort includes over 14 000 infants with due dates between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, who were subsequently followed up into adulthood. Data were analyzed October 29, 2021, to March 11, 2024. A novel linkage (completed in 2020) was performed to link high-resolution (100 m2) estimates of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter under 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and noise pollution to home addresses from pregnancy to 12 years of age. Psychotic experiences, depression, and anxiety were measured at ages 13, 18, and 24 years. Logistic regression models controlled for key individual-, family-, and area-level confounders. This cohort study included 9065 participants who had any mental health data, of whom (with sample size varying by parameter) 51.4% (4657 of 9051) were female, 19.5% (1544 of 7910) reported psychotic experiences, 11.4% (947 of 8344) reported depression, and 9.7% (811 of 8398) reported anxiety. Mean (SD) age at follow-up was 24.5 (0.8) years. After covariate adjustment, IQR increases (0.72 μg/m3) in PM2.5 levels during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.11 [95% CI, 1.04-1.19]; P = .002) and during childhood (AOR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.00-1.10]; P = .04) were associated with elevated odds for psychotic experiences. Pregnancy PM2.5 exposure was also associated with depression (AOR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.02-1.18]; P = .01). Higher noise pollution exposure in childhood (AOR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.03-1.38]; P = .02) and adolescence (AOR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.02-1.45]; P = .03) was associated with elevated odds for anxiety. In this longitudinal cohort study, early-life air and noise pollution exposure were prospectively associated with 3 common mental health problems from adolescence to young adulthood. There was a degree of specificity in terms of pollutant-timing-outcome associations. Interventions to reduce air and noise pollution exposure (eg, clean air zones) could potentially improve population mental health. Replication using quasi-experimental designs is now needed to shed further light on the underlying causes of these associations.

[PMID: 31460967] Exposure to high levels of fine particle air pollution (PM2.5) is associated with adolescent pathophysiology. It is unclear, however, if PM2.5 is associated with physiology within psychosocial contexts, such as social stress, and whether some adolescents are particularly vulnerable to PM2.5-related adverse effects. This study examined the association between PM2.5 and autonomic reactivity to social stress in adolescents and tested whether symptoms of anxiety and depression moderated this association. Adolescents from Northern California (N = 144) participated in a modified Trier Social Stress Test while providing high-frequency heart rate variability and skin conductance level data. PM2.5 data were recorded from CalEnviroScreen. Adolescents reported on their own symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Youth Self-Report, which has been used in prior studies and has good psychometric properties (Cronbach's α in this sample was .86). Adolescents residing in neighborhoods characterized by higher concentrations of PM2.5 demonstrated greater autonomic reactivity (i.e., indexed by lower heart rate variability and higher skin conductance level) (β = .27; b = .44, p = .001, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.68) in response to social stress; this association was not accounted for by socioeconomic factors. In addition, adolescents who reported more severe anxiety and depression symptoms showed the strongest association between PM2.5 and autonomic reactivity to social stress (β = .53; b = .86, p < .001, 95% CI = 0.48 to 1.23). Exposure to PM2.5 may heighten adolescent physiological reactivity to social stressors. Moreover, adolescents who experience anxiety and depression may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of PM2.5 on stress reactivity.",3

We aimed to assess CFI's usefulness in the early dementia risk identification.MethodsThis study involved 196 older adults with normal cognition in a randomized controlled intervention trial. CFI was assessed every six months from baseline to 18 months, using the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC) to measure cognitive decline. We employed a mixed model for repeated measures to compare the CFI scores at 18 months in the ApoE4, ADCS-PACC, and allocation groups.ResultsCFI scores increased in ApoE4 carriers and decreased in the intervention group, with significant differences observed in the CFI score changes at 18 months between carriers and non-carriers and among the allocation groups (p = 0.002, p = 0.026, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in the CFI score change among ADCS-PACC groups (p = 0101).ConclusionsWe observed CFI scores worsening over time in individuals with ApoE4 and showing a tendency to deteriorate over time in those with objective cognitive decline. These findings suggest that the CFI may be able to identify high-risk individuals for dementia at an early stage. Furthermore, the improvement in the CFI score is considered a significant finding when considering future measures for subjective cognitive decline.

[PMID: 40214756] Epidemiological studies indicate that type 2 diabetes increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in cerebral metabolism have been proposed as a potential mechanism underlying this association. A better understanding of these metabolic changes may elucidate potential pathways linking type 2 diabetes to Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the current exploratory study was to investigate whether cerebral metabolism, including glucose and fatty acid uptake as well as cerebral blood flow, is altered in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with both overweight individuals and lean control individuals. This exploratory study included 38 participants (ten with type 2 diabetes, 13 overweight individuals and 15 lean control individuals). Brain metabolism was assessed using multiple imaging techniques: [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-6-thiaheptadecanoic acid positron emission tomography for glucose and fatty acid uptake; arterial spin-labelling MRI for cerebral perfusion; and <sup>1</sup>H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy for specific metabolites. Neurodegeneration markers were evaluated from lumbar puncture samples. Group comparisons were assessed using one-way ANOVA and unpaired t tests, and correlations were assessed with linear regression. Individuals with type 2 diabetes exhibited lower cerebral glucose uptake compared with both lean and overweight groups (p<0.01). Cerebral perfusion was reduced in both participants with type 2 diabetes and overweight participants relative to lean control participants (p<0.01). Both glucose uptake and perfusion correlated negatively with HOMA-IR, insulin and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (p<0.001-p<0.05). White matter fatty acid uptake was elevated in the diabetes group compared with the lean group (p<0.05). Post hoc analyses revealed that lean APOE-ε4 carriers had increased fatty acid uptake in the entire brain relative to lean non-carriers. Among non-carriers of APOE-ε4, those with type 2 diabetes showed higher fatty acid uptake than lean control individuals (p<0.01-p<0.05), and this uptake correlated positively with HOMA-IR, insulin and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (p<0.05). Type 2 diabetes was associated with decreased cerebral perfusion and glucose uptake but increased fatty acid uptake in white matter. The elevated fatty acid uptake observed both in individuals with type 2 diabetes and in APOE-ε4 carriers suggests a common metabolic dysfunction for these Alzheimer's disease risk factors and suggests that targeting cerebral metabolic dysfunction, particularly fatty acid metabolism, could be a potential strategy for reducing the risk for neurodegeneration in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

[PMID: 39725857] The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane protein found in microglia within the brain, and its soluble form (sTREM2) has been shown to reduce amyloid deposition. Whether elevated TREM2-mediated microglial activity decreases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess whether high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of sTREM2 attenuate the risk of APOE ε4-associated amyloid pathology. We included 877 cognitively intact subjects from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study, including APOE ε4 carriers (n = 136) and non-carriers (n = 741). The linear regression was used to examine the interaction effect between CSF sTREM2 levels and APOE ε4 status on CSF Aβ42 levels. Additionally, subgroup analyses stratified by sex and age were conducted. Our main finding was that higher concentrations of CSF sTREM2 attenuated the effect of APOE ε4 carriage (i.e., the sTREM2 × APOE ε4 interaction) on amyloid deposition (β = -2.701e-05, p = 0.023). Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of interaction was still significant only in male (p = 0.041) and mid-life (p = 0.013) subgroups. Our study suggested that in cognitively intact individuals, changes in sTREM2 levels are associated with biomarkers of AD, and higher concentrations of CSF sTREM2 attenuated the risk of APOE ε4-related amyloid pathology. The identified role of the sTREM2 × APOE ε4 interaction in amyloid pathology offers new insights into potential strategies for AD prevention in APOE ε4 carriers.",3

The updated LIfestyle for BRAin health (LIBRA2) score integrates 15 modifiable risk and protective factors to quantify lifestyle-based dementia risk, but its relationship with stroke and dementia subtypes remains unexplored. We investigated LIBRA2's association with stroke and dementia subtypes while also assessing potential interactions with genetic susceptibility. Prospective data were used from the French multicenter Three-City (3C) Study, with participants aged 65 years and older followed for up to 17 years. Weighted LIBRA2 scores at baseline were constructed based on the presence of 15 modifiable risk and protective factors, with higher scores representing higher lifestyle-based dementia risk. Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the association of LIBRA2 with incident dementia (and subtypes) and stroke, adjudicated by expert neurologist panels. Genetic susceptibility to dementia and stroke was assessed using <i>APOE</i> ε4 carriership and disease-specific genetic risk scores. Analyses included 4,731 participants for stroke (mean age 73.8 years, 60.1% female) and 4,737 participants for dementia (mean age 73.8 years, 59.9% female). One-point increases in LIBRA2 scores (theoretical range -6.1 to +25.7) were associated with increased dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08; 1.06-1.11), with a stronger association for vascular and mixed dementia (HR 1.13; 1.08-1.18) compared with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (HR 1.06; 1.03-1.09). LIBRA2 was not significantly associated with incident stroke risk (HR 1.03; 0.99-1.07). No significant interaction was found between LIBRA2 and <i>APOE</i> ε4 carriership or disease-specific genetic risk scores in relation to dementia subtypes or stroke. LIBRA2 serves as a valuable tool for assessing lifestyle-related dementia risk and its subtypes but showed no association with stroke, highlighting the potential for a stroke-specific risk reduction model. These associations were independent of genetic disease susceptibility, reinforcing the universal benefits of lifestyle modifications on dementia risk reduction. The stronger association between LIBRA2 (and some individual components) and vascular or mixed dementia, compared with AD dementia, highlights the pivotal role of vascular mechanisms in the relationship between lifestyle and brain health.

[PMID: 41184483] Female reproductive aging is accompanied by a sharp increase in egg aneuploidy rates. Premature loss of chromosome cohesion proteins and early separation of chromosomes are thought to cause high aneuploidy rates during maternal aging. However, because cohesion loss occurs gradually throughout a woman's reproductive lifespan, and because cytoskeletal defects alone can lead to chromosomal abnormalities, the main causes of the rapid rise in aneuploidy at older reproductive ages are still unclear. In this study, we created a versatile and tunable cohesion manipulation system that enables rapid, dose-dependent degradation of the meiotic cohesin REC8 in live mouse oocytes. By coupling this system with quantitative high-resolution live imaging, we directly observed cohesion protein behavior during meiosis and tested the longstanding threshold model of aneuploidy development. Our results show that premature sister chromatid separation sharply increases only when REC8 levels drop below a critical threshold, supporting the idea of a nonlinear, vulnerability-triggering cohesion limit. We also used our system to examine how other age-related issues, such as cytoskeletal disruption and partial centromere dysfunction, can exacerbate chromatid separation in the context of weakened cohesion. This work provides a tractable oocyte platform for modeling and dissecting the multifactorial mechanisms driving female reproductive age-related egg aneuploidy.

[PMID: 41183275] Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a progressive neurologic disorder characterized by chronic inflammation in the CNS. HTLV-1-specific cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP; however, the dynamics of CTLs in the CSF remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the accumulation of HTLV-1-specific CTLs in the CSF of patients with HAM/TSP and to evaluate their association with neuroinflammation and neural damage. The frequency of HTLV-1-specific CTLs was compared between paired peripheral blood (PB) and CSF from patients with HAM/TSP and asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) using MHC/antigen tetramers. In addition, cytokine levels and neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentration were analyzed in the CSF of patients with HAM/TSP and ACs. The frequency of HTLV-1-specific CTLs in PB was significantly higher in patients with HAM/TSP compared with ACs (median [interquartile range (IQR)] = 3.0 [0.9-8.3] % vs 0.3 [0.2-3.1] %, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Notably, this difference was even more pronounced in CSF, where patients with HAM/TSP exhibited a significantly elevated frequency compared with ACs (19.1 [7.9-33.4] % vs 6.1 [0.9-15.7] %, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Furthermore, the frequency of HTLV-1-specific CTLs in the CSF was considerably higher than in the PB of patients with HAM/TSP (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The lack of accumulation of cytomegalovirus-specific CTLs indicates that HTLV-1-specific CTLs selectively accumulate in the CSF of patients with HAM/TSP. These accumulated HTLV-1-specific CTLs in the CSF significantly correlated with increased levels of cytokines in patients with HAM/TSP. In addition, CSF NfL levels were significantly higher in patients with HAM/TSP than in ACs (696 [534-1,407] vs 429 [373-717] pg/mL, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and showed a positive correlation with HTLV-1 proviral load. HTLV-1-specific CTLs selectively accumulate in the CSF of patients with HAM/TSP. Chronic inflammation, primarily driven by the interaction between proliferating HTLV-1-infected cells and accumulated HTLV-1-specific CTLs, may contribute to neural damage in patients with HAM/TSP.",3

In this study, molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of alpha-mangostin in defending hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced neurotoxicity was explored. cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptotic cascades, and protein expression profiles were performed incorporation of molecular docking. Human SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with 1 μM alpha-mangostin for 3 h prior to exposure to 400 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. alpha-Mangostin significantly inhibited oxidative stress-induced cell death in neuronal cells by reducing BAX protein, decreasing caspase-3/7 activation, and increasing anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein. Collectively, alpha-mangostin was demonstrated to be a prominent ROS suppressor which reversed the reduction of antioxidant enzymes (CAT and SOD2). Surprisingly, alpha-mangostin significantly promoted the expression of the sirtuin family and the FOXO3a transcription factor exerting beneficial effects on cell survival and longevity. A molecular docking study predicted that alpha-mangostin is directly bound to the active site of SIRT1. Findings from this study suggest that alpha-mangostin potentially serves as a promising therapeutic compound against oxidative stress by activation of the SIRT1/3-FOXO3a pathway comparable to the effect of memantine, an anti-AD drug used for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia.

[PMID: 35498835] Neuronal cell death is a key feature of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Plant polyphenols, namely butein, isoliquiritigenin, and scopoletin, have been shown to exhibit various biological activities including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities. Herein, butein, isoliquiritigenin, and scopoletin were explored for their neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress-induced human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cell death. The cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) revealed a reduction in cell viability and increases in apoptosis and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with 5 μM of butein, isoliquiritigenin, or scopoletin protected against the cell death induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and decreased the levels of apoptotic cells and ROS. In addition, the levels of SIRT1, FoxO3a, ADAM10, BCL-2, and antioxidant enzymes (catalase and SOD2) were maintained in the cells pretreated with butein, isoliquiritigenin, or scopoletin before H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment compared to cells without pretreatment and the reference (resveratrol). Molecular docking analysis revealed that the interactions between the activator-binding sites of SIRT1 and the phenolic compounds were similar to those of resveratrol. Taken together, the data suggest that these polyphenolic compounds could be potential candidates for prevention and/or treatment of neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 30929586] <b>Background:</b> An imbalance of free radicals and antioxidant defense systems in physiological processes can result in protein/DNA damage, inflammation, and cellular apoptosis leading to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Sesamin and sesamol, compounds derived from sesame seeds and oil, have been reported to exert various pharmacological effects, especially antioxidant activity. However, their molecular mechanisms against the oxidative stress induced by exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) remain to be elucidated. <b>Aim:</b> In this study, neuroprotective effects of sesamin and sesamol on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell death and possible signaling pathways in the cells were explored. <b>Methods:</b> MTT assay and flow cytometry were conducted to determine cell viability and apoptotic profiles of neuronal cells treated with sesamin and sesamol. Carboxy-DCFDA assay was used to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, Western blot analysis was performed to investigate protein profiles associated with neuroprotection. <b>Results:</b> Pretreatment of the cells with 1 µM of sesamin and sesamol remarkably reduced the SH-SY5Y cell death induced by 400 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as well as the intracellular ROS production. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuroprotection of the compounds were associated with activating SIRT1-SIRT3-FOXO3a expression, inhibiting BAX (proapoptotic protein), and upregulating BCL-2 (anti-apoptotic protein). <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings suggest that sesamin and sesamol are compounds that potentially protect neuronal cells against oxidative stress similar to that of the resveratrol, the reference compound. These antioxidants are thus of interest for further investigation in <i>in vivo</i> models of neuroprotection.",3
Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori decreases risk of gastric cancer in humans.,Helicobacter pylori AND Gastric cancer risk AND Protective effect AND Gastric neoplasm,"39781526,40200873,39784713","[PMID: 39781526] <b>Background:</b> Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health challenge. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze GC epidemiology and risk factors to inform prevention and intervention strategies. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 data, conducted 16 different machine learning (ML) models of NHANES data, performed Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on disease phenotypes, dietary preferences, microbiome, blood-based markers, and integrated differential gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from multiple cohorts to identify factors associated with GC risk. <b>Results:</b> Global age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates (ASDR) for GC declined from 886.24 to 358.42 per 100,000 population between 1990 and 2030, with significant regional disparities. Despite this decline, total disability-adjusted life years show a concerning upward trend from 2015, rising from approximately 22.9 million to a projected 24.3 million by 2030. The slope index of inequality shifted from 87 in 1990 to -184 in 2021, indicating a reversal in GC burden distribution, with higher ASDR now associated with lower socio-demographic index countries. The ML models analysis identified higher levels of clinical characteristics such as phosphorus, calcium, eosinophils percent, and triglycerides, as well as lower levels of iron and monocyte percent, may be associated with an increased risk of GC. MR analyses revealed causal associations between GC risk and disease phenotypes such as <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection, chronic gastritis, obesity, depression, and dietary preferences such as dairy and processed meats. Gut microbiome analysis showed associations with microbiome such as <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> species. Blood-based markers analysis identified protective and risk effects for cortisol, glutamate, nicotinamide, Natural Killer %lymphocyte, CD4-CD8- T cell Absolute Count, Phosphatidylcholine (16:0_18:1), and Interleukin-1-alpha. Integrated genomic analysis identified 10 genes significantly associated with GC risk, with strong evidence for colocalization in genes such as <i>CCR6</i> and <i>PILRB</i>. <b>Conclusions:</b> This systematic analysis reveals complex global trends in GC burden and identifies novel clinical, disease phenotypes, dietary preferences, microbial, blood-based, and genetic risk factors. These findings provide potential targets for improved risk stratification, prevention, and intervention strategies to reduce the global burden of GC.

[PMID: 40200873] Despite extensive research on gastric cancer (GC), efforts to consolidate the numerous associations between possible factors and GC risk remain lacking. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of potential GC-associated pairs. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, from their inception to April 23, 2022, for eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses to investigate the association between any possible factors and GC risk. After the inclusion of 75 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 117 association pairs were examined. We reanalyzed the included meta-analyses and produced effect estimates using uniform analytical models. The certainty of the evidence for each association pair was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Iatrogenic factors, including antibacterial drugs, were associated with an increased risk of GC. Epstein-Barr virus and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infections were also associated with an increased risk of GC, while human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infections were associated with a reduced risk. Dietary habit was a major factor influencing moderate to high GRADE associations. Positive associations were observed for heavy alcohol consumption (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.12), refined grain consumption (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.21-1.53), and habitual salt intake (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.04-1.91). The associations between GC risk and dietary and nutritional factors were considerably heterogeneous, whereas other factors, such as lifestyle and iatrogenic and environmental exposures, were consistent across regions. Therefore, dietary interventions for GC prevention should be tailored specific to regions. PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42020209817.

[PMID: 39784713] atrophic gastritis has a high risk of progressing to gastric cancer. Screening early gastric cancer and predicting the risk of atrophic gastritis developing into gastric cancer could improve the prognosis. this study evaluated the significance of miR-1260b in early gastric cancer and the progression of atrophic gastritis to gastric cancer aiming to explore a reliable biomarker. the study enrolled 78 early gastric cancer patients and 77 atrophic gastritis patients. The expression of miR-1260b was detected in serum and tissue samples by PCR. The risk of atrophic gastritis patients progressing to gastric cancer was assessed and correlated with miR-1260b levels. The potential of miR-1260b to distinguish early gastric cancer was evaluated by ROC. In vitro, gastric cancer cells were infected with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), and the regulatory effect of miR-1260b on cell growth and metastasis was evaluated by CCK8 and Transwell assay. significant upregulation of miR-1260b was observed in early gastric cancer patients relative to atrophic gastritis patients, which distinguishes early gastric cancer patients and showed a positive correlation with the risk of atrophic gastritis patients developing gastric cancer. Early gastric cancer patients with positive H. pylori infection had higher miR-1260b levels, and increasing miR-1260b was also observed in H. pylori-infected gastric cancer cells. H. pylori promoted cell growth and metastasis of gastric cancer while silencing miR-1260b alleviated these effects. miR-1260b negatively regulated ZNF302, and the knockdown of ZNF302 reversed the protective effect of miR-1260 knockdown on gastric cancer cells. increasing miR-1260b can assist in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer and predict the risk of gastric cancer in atrophic gastritis patients. Silencing miR-1260b may alleviate the promotion of gastric cancer induced by H. pylori via negative modulation of ZNF302.",3
General exercise therapy is more effective than rotator cuff exercises in reducing pain and improving function of the shoulder.,exercise therapy AND rotator cuff exercises AND pain reduction AND shoulder function,"36868297,40371595,39189423","[PMID: 36868297] Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and corticosteroids are used to treat rotator cuff diseases. However, few reviews have compared the effects of these 2 treatments. In this study, we compared the effects of PRP and corticosteroid injection on the prognosis of rotator cuff diseases. According to the Cochrane Manual of Systematic Review of Interventions, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched comprehensively. Two independent authors screened suitable studies and performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Only randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of PRP and corticosteroid in the treatment of rotator cuff injuries were included, as measured by clinical function and pain during different follow-up periods. Nine studies with 469 patients were included in this review. In short-term treatment, corticosteroids were superior to PRP in the improvement of Constant, Simple Shoulder Test, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (mean difference [MD] -5.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.26, 0.06; P = .05 and MD -0.97, 95% CI -1.68, -0.07; P = .03 and MD -6.67, 95% CI -12.85, -0.49; P = .03, respectively). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups at midterm (P > .05), and the recovery of the Simple Shoulder Test and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores in PRP treatment was significantly better than that in corticosteroid treatment in the long term (MD: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.74; P < .00001 and MD: 6.96, 95% CI: 3.90, 9.61; P < .00001, respectively). In pain reduction based on visual analog scale score, corticosteroids led to better pain reduction (MD: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.64; P = .04), but no significant difference was observed in pain reduction between the 2 groups in the any term (P > .05). However, these differences did not reach the minimum clinically important difference. Current analysis showed that corticosteroids have better efficacy in short term, whereas PRP is more beneficial for long-term recovery. However, no difference was observed in the mid-term efficacy between the 2 groups. Randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up periods and larger sample sizes are also needed to determine the optimal treatment.

[PMID: 40371595] Rotator cuff (RC) pathology encompasses a wide range of conditions, which include bursitis, tendinitis, tendinosis, partial thickness tears and full-thickness tears. To treat painful musculoskeletal problems, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been employed as a non-pharmacological alternative. Photobiomodulation (PBM), which uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and other photo-emitting devices, is a minimally invasive approach used to treat a wide range of conditions. The purpose of this pre-post study design is to evaluate the effectiveness of PBM and exercise-based rehabilitation on pain and functional recovery in patients with RC pathology. Twenty of the thirty-seven patients who were tested for shoulder disorders and found to have RC pathology were included in the study. The patients' pain levels were measured using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) both at baseline and 6 weeks later. The mean ± standard deviation of NPRS was calculated, data was checked for normal distribution, and the Wilcoxon rank test was conducted to compare the values. Our study showed a statistically significant reduction in pain scores from baseline (7.33 ± 0.79) to 6 weeks (2.50 ± 0.69), p < 0.001 of PBM and exercise-based rehabilitation. The knowledge about the evidence regarding the effectiveness of PBM, along with exercise-based rehabilitation, is critical.

[PMID: 39189423] To evaluate the effectiveness of trigger point manual therapy (TPMT) in treating rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP). Randomized controlled trials that compared the effects of TPMT with no or other conservative treatments in patients with RCRSP were included. Primary outcomes were shoulder pain intensity and function. Secondary outcomes were pressure pain threshold (PPT) and number of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, PEDro scale and GRADE approach were employed. Ten studies were included in this systematic review and seven in the meta-analysis. Very low to low quality of evidence showed no statistically significant difference between TPMT and other conservative treatments in rest and activity pain reduction in the short term (3 days to 12 weeks), and the difference in shoulder function was statistically significant in favor of TPMT. Furthermore, TPMT was found to be effective in the improvement of PPT and the inactivation of active MTrPs in the short term. TPMT may be equally effective as other passive treatments for the pain reduction in patients with RCRSP in the short term, and slightly more effective for functional improvement. TPMT seems to be effective to treat the active MTrPs in RCRSP. CRD42023409101.",3
General exercise therapy is more effective than scapular stabilizer exercises in reducing pain and improving function of the shoulder.,shoulder pain AND general exercise therapy AND scapular stabilizer exercises AND functional outcomes,"36922413,41187315,41187335","[PMID: 36922413] The main aim of the trial was to assess the combined impact of graded Thera-Band strengthening exercises and scapular stabilization exercises on shoulder pain, physical function, and quality of life (QoL) in post-mastectomy adhesive capsulitis (AC). Seventy females with unilateral post-mastectomy AC partook in the trial. Participants were subdivided equally into two groups at random. Both groups obtained the traditional physical therapy program; in addition, the intervention group received graded Thera-Band exercises for shoulder muscles and scapular stabilization exercises 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Range of motion (ROM) and muscle power of shoulder were assessed by digital goniometer and handheld dynamometer, respectively. Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH) was utilized for assessment of shoulder function and visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain measurement while short-form (SF-36) for QoL assessment. All evaluation data was recorded prior to the trial and at the eighth week of interventions for both groups. All participants achieved improvements in shoulder ROM, muscle power, pain, and all aspects of QoL; however, higher statistical improvements were reported in all measurements with respect to strengthening exercises group (p < 0.001). The addition of graded Thera-Band strengthening exercises and scapular stabilization exercises in post-mastectomy AC rehabilitation program has significant benefits in shoulder function and patients' QoL. This study is retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05311839.

[PMID: 41187315] We examined changes in peak and rapid force and surface electromyographic (sEMG) excitation among females using monophasic OC and females not using OC following immobilization and rehabilitation. To examine potential sex differences, a male control group was included. Ten males, 10 OC females, and 10 non-OC females (mean ± SD age = 23 ± 3 years) immobilized their left wrist/hand with a brace for one week, followed by ≥ one week of rehabilitation. Participants completed grip tests to assess peak force and the rate of force development (RFD) before and after immobilization and post-rehabilitation, with electromyographic signals recorded from the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECBR) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS). Grip force declined post-immobilization: males = -17.2 ± 10.3%, non-OC = -22.3 ± 24.7%, OC = -20.7 ± 14.8%. No significant time × group interactions were observed for any dependent variables (p > 0.05, η² ≤ 0.084). Time effects showed recovery post-rehab across all groups. RFD, particularly at 200 ms, declined posttest and rebounded post-rehab. ECBR excitation increased post-rehab; FDS excitation responses were highly variable across participants. Five participants required > one week of rehabilitation (2 males, 2 non-OC, 1 OC), suggesting rapid recovery for most. Males and females in this study exhibited similar declines and recovery in grip force after one week of wrist/hand immobilization, regardless of OC use. These findings suggest that the influence of OC use on neuromuscular outcomes in females undergoing short-term musculoskeletal rehabilitation may be minimal.

[PMID: 41187335] DNA nanostructure-enabled functional constructs have shown potential to improve healthcare outcomes by offering advanced disease diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Translating this potential of DNA nanostructure-based constructs to real life applications relies on maintaining and enhancing the structural integrity and functions of the surface-anchored moieties. In this study, we explored the possibility of utilizing choline dihydrogen phosphate (CDHP) solution, an aqueous solution of ionic liquid, to assemble DNA nanostructures of different sizes and complexities with enhanced biostability and ligand binding affinity. We show successful formation of the DNA nanostructures in aqueous CDHP solution using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and circular dichroism (CD). Biostability assays reveal that the aqueous CDHP solution may provide passive protection to DNA nanostructures against DNase I and human serum for up to 48 h. We also demonstrate that this enhanced biostability arises both from the structural conformation imparted during CDHP-mediated folding and from the presence of free CDHP ions in the solution. Notably, removal of free ions reduced the passive protection effect, but did not eliminate it, indicating the contribution of both folding and surrounding free ions. Using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we show that the presence of aqueous CDHP solution can enhance the binding of aptamer-functionalized DNA nanostructures to specific receptors on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Our strategy of using ionic liquid solution for one-pot preparation with enhanced stability and functionality offers a robust, simpler and faster alternative for DNA nanostructure-based constructs.",3

Metabolically active extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying tumor-specific KRAS mutations offer promise as disease-specific biomarkers. Informed by genomic profiling of tumor tissue, plasma samples were prospectively collected from 44 patients, with confirmed KRAS-mutated PDAC, undergoing neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) followed by surgery between 2019 and 2021. Samples were obtained at diagnosis, post-NAT, and 1 month post surgery. EVs were isolated using lipid nanoprobe technology, and EV-associated KRAS mutations were detected using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Patients were grouped on the basis of temporal changes in EV-associated KRAS mutation allele frequency (MAF): no KRAS detected (ND), decreasing MAF (DD), and increasing MAF (ID). Among 44 patients, 29 (65.9%) were ND, 8 (18.2%) DD, and 7 (15.9%) ID. Detectable EV-associated KRAS MAF was found in 21%, 30%, and 50% of patients with stages I, II, and III PDAC. No significant differences were noted in demographic or clinical variables (p > 0.05). The ND group had the longest restricted mean disease-free survival (rmDFS: 31.2 months), followed by DD (27.8 months) and ID (9.8 months; p = 0.010). Similarly, restricted mean overall survival (rmOS) was longest in the ND (40.3 months), followed by DD (35.7 months) and ID (17.7 months; p = 0.012). On multivariable analysis, increasing EV-KRAS MAF (ID group) independently predicted inferior rmDFS [hazard ratio (HR): 6.14; p = 0.001] and rmOS (HR: 6.95; p = 0.002). Temporal increase of EV-KRAS MAF is a significant predictor of reduced DFS and OS in PDAC. Integrating EV-KRAS mutation allele frequency dynamics analysis with current biomarkers such as carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) could improve treatment monitoring and survival prognostication.

[PMID: 41186887] This research examines how NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) and its functional variant rs2273534 influence gastric cancer (GC) risk, development, and prognosis, along with the molecular pathways involved. 840 GC patients and 840 healthy controls participated in a case-control research. Genetic association analyses, molecular experiments (qRT-PCR, Western blot, functional assays), and bioinformatics approaches were employed. Cell-based and animal experiments were employed to validate the oncogenic role of NKILA and its regulatory axis. Carriers of the NKILA rs2273534 C allele exhibited a markedly higher susceptibility to GC (OR = 1.51, p = 0.003) and an unfavorable prognosis (HR = 1.89, p = 0.016), which was also associated with elevated NKILA expression. Elevated NKILA expression in GC tissues was associated with advanced clinicopathological characteristics. Mechanistically, NKILA promotes the expression of 5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 2 (OAS2) through sponging miR-4424, which in turn facilitates proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in GC cells. Rescue experiments confirmed that the NKILA/miR-4424/OAS2 axis is crucial for GC malignancy. The rs2273534 SNP enhances NKILA expression and drives GC progression through the NKILA/miR-4424/OAS2 axis. Our findings highlight rs2273534 as a possible indicator for GC susceptibility and prognosis, offering insights into the oncogenic mechanisms mediated by lncRNAs.

[PMID: 41186130] To investigate the role of HSD3B1 germline variant (1245C) in hormone therapy outcomes in Chinese prostate cancer (PCa) patients. A multi-center observational study was conducted enrolling 785 PCa patients who received primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in China. Genotyping of germline variant and survival data were obtained, and clinical outcomes were analysed using Cox regression models. The median follow-up time was 31 months. In the entire study cohort, the HSD3B1 variant (1245C) was significantly associated with a shorter time to castration resistance after adjusting for Gleason grade group (dominant model: hazard ratio, HR = 1.62, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 1.10-2.40, p = 0.015; additive model: HR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.12-2.13, p = 0.008). Subgroup analysis (n = 438) with patients receiving only ADT for HSPC revealed a more significant association between the C allele and ADT failure (dominant model: HR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.49-3.77, p < 0.001; additive model: HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.34-2.79, p < 0.001). Among patients who received next-generation hormone therapy after ADT failure, the C allele was associated with poorer abiraterone response (HR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.07-8.50, p = 0.037); however, no significant change of response from enzalutamide was observed (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.27-3.51, p = 0.972). The HSD3B1 germline variant (1245C) is linked to earlier ADT failure and diminished efficacy of abiraterone but does not affect enzalutamide in the treatment of PCa patients. These findings underscore its potential as a biomarker to guide personalized treatment in PCa.",3

Here Gpr124 conditional knockout (CKO) in the endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity, but resulted in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic stroke and glioblastoma, accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Constitutive activation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice, with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction, pericyte coverage and extracellular-matrix deficits. We thus identify Gpr124 as an endothelial GPCR specifically required for endothelial Wnt signaling and BBB integrity under pathological conditions in adult mice. This finding implicates Gpr124 as a potential therapeutic target for human CNS disorders characterized by BBB disruption.

Having a main partner worsens HIV outcomes.,HIV outcomes AND main partner AND sexual behavior AND relationship dynamics,"29164353,23680303,11565591","[PMID: 29164353] This study drew on the Theory of Gender and Power (TGP) as a framework to assess power inequalities within heterosexual dyads and their effects on women. Structural equation modeling was used to better understand the relationship between structural and interpersonal power and HIV sexual risk within African American and Latina women's heterosexual dyads. The main outcome variable was women's sexual HIV risk in the dyad and was created using women's reports of condomless sex with their main male partners and partners' reports of their HIV risk behaviors. Theoretical associations developed a priori yielded a well-fitting model that explained almost a quarter of the variance in women's sexual HIV risk in main partner dyads. Women's and partner structural power were indirectly associated with women's sexual HIV risk through substance use and interpersonal power. Interpersonal power was directly associated with risk. In addition, this study found that not identifying as heterosexual was directly and indirectly associated with women's heterosexual sex risk. This study provides further support for the utility of the TGP and the relevance of gender-related power dynamics for HIV prevention among heterosexually-active women.

[PMID: 23680303] This article explores the complex, dynamic and contextual frameworks within which men working in a mining community and their live-in long-term partners or spouses (termed ""couples"" in this study) respond to the introduction of HIV into their heterosexual relationships; the way in which partners adopt gendered positions in enabling them to make sense of their illness; how they negotiate their respective masculine and feminine roles in response to the need for HIV-related lifestyle changes; as well as the gendered nature of partner support in relation to antiretroviral therapy (ARV) adherence. We conducted an in-depth qualitative study with a sample of 12 HIV-positive seroconcordant heterosexual couples in a South African mining organization. Transcripts based on semi-structured couple's interviews were analyzed using an inductive emergent thematic analytical method. The findings present compelling evidence that the impact of HIV and AIDS is mitigated, in the main, by the nature of the dyadic relationship. Where power and agency were skewed in accordance with traditional gender scripts, the impact of HIV and AIDS was deleterious in terms of negotiating disclosure, meeting expectations of care and support, and promoting treatment adherence. As a corollary, the study also revealed that where the relational dynamic evidenced a more equitable distribution of power, the challenge of negotiating illness was embraced in a way that strengthened the couples' affiliation in profound ways, manifested not simply in a reduction in risk behaviours, but in both partner's courage to re-visit sensitive issues related to managing their relationship in the context of a debilitating illness. Gendered positioning (by self and others) was found to play a crucial role in the way couples experienced HIV and ARV treatment, and underscored the positive role of a couples-counselling approach in the negotiation of the illness experience. However, as part of a broader social project, the findings highlight the need to address the shortcomings of a public health discourse on illness normalization that reifies and reinforces skewed gender relations. In essence, the findings make a compelling case for targeting couples as the primary unit of analysis and intervention in HIV and AIDS praxis, not only to enhance treatment and prevention outcomes, but to impact on and potentially transform the lived identity of such relationships, in AIDS-affected communities. We recommend early intervention with couples in terms of couples HIV testing, risk-reduction counselling and gender-based interventions giving couples opportunities to revisit and challenge their prevailing gendered identities. We note, however, that these efforts will be undermined in the long term, if the structural drivers of HIV risk and vulnerability, contained within macro-level social, economic and cultural practices, are not simultaneously addressed.

Mental health and substance use were assessed using the PHQ-9, GAD-7, AUDIT, and ASSIST. Bivariate associations were examined using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess factors associated with high situational confidence (BSCQ ≥ 80%). Participants had a mean age of 38.9 years (SD = 0.4); most were male (74.0%), non-Hispanic Black or other race/ethnicity (58.0%), and had a high school education or less (59.8%). A majority (66.4%) reported unstable housing in the 30 days prior to incarceration. Fewer than half (44.9%) reported high situational confidence, with a mean score of 67.6 (SD = 26.9). Higher recovery capital was strongly associated with high situational confidence (aOR = 2.66; 95% CI: 1.52-4.96). Depression (aOR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16-0.78), sexual minority status (aOR = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.01-0.78), and reliance on informal income-generating activities (""hustling"") (aOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10-1.01) were associated with lower situational confidence. Recovery capital is a strong predictor of situational confidence among justice-involved individuals receiving MOUD. Interventions that enhance recovery capital, including access to employment, housing, and social support, integrate mental health care, and provide tailored support for marginalized subgroups, may improve recovery outcomes during incarceration and reentry. Brief, validated tools like the BSCQ and BARC-10 may help identify individuals at greater relapse risk and guide more targeted, equity-informed reentry planning.

[PMID: 41186945] Advance care planning (ACP) engagement is poorly understood among people with serious illness. Determine whether diagnosis of and worries about serious illness are associated with ACP engagement. This cross-sectional study was based on a nationally representative survey administered April to May 2021 online or by telephone. Eligible participants were adults and English or Spanish language. Data were analyzed May 2023 to February 2025). Having a serious illness. Three domains of ACP engagement: discussion with people close to participants, discussion with clinicians, and documentation in writing. Barriers to ACP documentation and worries about serious illness were also assessed. Survey responses were weighted to reflect the US Census population. χ2 tests and multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for covariables to assess associations between serious illness and each ACP outcome. Among 1854 participants (468 [weighted percentage, 25.2%] aged 65 years or older; 955 women [weighted percentage, 51.9%]; 193 Black [weighted percentage, 12.0%], 288 Hispanic [weighted percentage, 16.7%], 1218 White [weighted percentage, 61.2%]), 367 (weighted percentage, 20%) had serious illness. Overall, 1254 (weighted percentage, 65.9%) had engaged in ACP (283 of 367 [weighted percentage, 76.5%] serious illness vs 971 of 1487 [weighted percentage, 62.6%] without serious illness; P < .001); 1071 (weighted percentage, 55.3%) discussed ACP with people close to them, 462 (weighted percentage, 22.5%) discussed with clinicians, and 650 (weighted percentage, 32.8%) documented a surrogate. People with serious illness had higher odds than those without having discussed choices for surrogates and medical wishes with people close to them (aOR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.19-2.07] and 1.66 [95% CI, 1.26-2.19]) and with clinicians (aOR, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.63-2.88] and 2.22 [95% CI, 1.67-2.94]). Serious illness status was not associated with ACP documentation. The most common barriers to documentation were not having thought about it (489 of 1171 [weighted percentage, 43.1%]) and assuming surrogates would know what they want (369 of 1171 [weighted percentage, 32.2%]). Participants who were worried (vs not worried) about being able to afford care, surrogates making the best or right decisions, having access to the best treatments, or having high stress or symptoms had significantly higher rates of ACP engagement. In this survey study of adults in the US, we found that ACP discussions with someone close to them were high, yet discussions with clinicians and documentation were low, even among people with serious illness. Our findings offer insights into how people's worries about serious illness care may affect their engagement in ACP, and how to leverage these insights to tailor patient-facing messaging about ACP.

[PMID: 41186946] There are disparities in blood pressure (BP) levels by race in the US. To estimate the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and deaths that could be prevented among non-Hispanic Black adults by achieving the same mean systolic BP (SBP) as non-Hispanic White adults 45 years or older. In this modeling study, the difference in mean SBP between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White US adults was calculated from the 2015-2020 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The 10-year cumulative incidence of CVD, including stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure, and CVD mortality for non-Hispanic Black adults were calculated using data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. The relative risk reduction for CVD events and mortality with initiation and intensification of antihypertensive medication treatment was applied from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration (BPLTTC), calibrated to reflect the SBP reduction for non-Hispanic Black adults to have the same SBP as non-Hispanic White adults. Data were analyzed from June 22, 2022, to August 13, 2025. Systolic blood pressure. Number of CVD events and deaths. Using data from NHANES, REGARDS, and BPLTCC, the cumulative incidence of CVD events and deaths expected over the next 10 years with current SBP levels and with SBP equity was estimated. Among 82.3 million US adults included in the study, 37.2 million (45.3%) were men, 45.0 million (54.7%) were women, 10.1 million (12.2%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 72.2 million (87.8%) were non-Hispanic White. The mean (SD) age was 60.8 (0.3) years. The mean SBP was 130.7 (95% CI, 129.0-132.5) mm Hg among non-Hispanic Black adults and 124.2 (95% CI, 123.1-125.3) mm Hg among non-Hispanic White adults for those not taking antihypertensive medication (difference, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.5-8.5] mm Hg), and 137.8 (95% CI, 135.8-139.8) mm Hg among non-Hispanic Black adults and 131.2 (95% CI, 129.7-132.7) mm Hg among non-Hispanic White adults for those taking antihypertensive medication (difference, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.0-9.1] mm Hg). Achieving equity in SBP between non-Hispanic Black and White adults was projected to reduce the number of CVD events during 10 years by 50 434 (95% CI, 33 985-71 137) among non-Hispanic Black US adults not taking antihypertensive medication and 122 881 (95% CI, 83 220-176 826) among non-Hispanic Black adults taking antihypertensive medication. Achieving equity in SBP between non-Hispanic Black and White adults was projected to reduce the number of CVD deaths during 10 years by 21 703 (95% CI, 7313-40 278) among non-Hispanic Black US adults not taking antihypertensive medication and 55 055 (95% CI, 19 823-99 693) among non-Hispanic Black adults taking antihypertensive medication. The largest proportion of CVD events and deaths prevented were among those aged 45 to 64 years. For example, more than half of CVD events prevented among non-Hispanic Black adults not taking antihypertensive medication (55%) were in that age group. The findings of this modeling study suggest that achieving SBP equity between non-Hispanic Black and White adults could substantially reduce the number of CVD events and deaths experienced by non-Hispanic Black US adults. Initiatives to maintain normal BP and achieve BP control for individuals with hypertension could have a substantial impact on health equity in the US.",3

Motivated by practical challenges in decoding DroneID-a proprietary OFDM-like signaling format used by DJI drones with a nonstandard frame structure-we present TranSIC-Net, a Transformer-based end-to-end neural network that unifies channel estimation and symbol detection within a single architecture. Unlike conventional methods that treat these steps separately, TranSIC-Net implicitly learns channel dynamics from pilot patterns and exploits the attention mechanism to capture inter-subcarrier correlations. While initially developed to tackle the unique structure of DroneID, the model demonstrates strong generalizability: with minimal adaptation, it can be applied to a wide range of OFDM systems. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic OFDM waveforms and real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) signals show that TranSIC-Net consistently outperforms least-squares plus zero-forcing (LS+ZF) and leading deep learning baselines such as ProEsNet in terms of bit error rate (BER), estimation accuracy, and robustness-highlighting its effectiveness and flexibility in practical wireless communication scenarios.

[PMID: 41104300] Vaccine coverage for common infectious diseases such as Measles and Pertussis (also known as whooping cough) have been declining in England and Wales since 2014. Consequently, significant increases in Measles and Pertussis cases are observed in the community. To explore whether Google Trends offers a predictive utility as a health surveillance tool for Meases and Pertussis in England and Wales. Google search data related to Measles and Pertussis, including common associated symptoms, were downloaded for 52 weeks from 07/01/2023 - 07/01/2024. Measles and Pertussis case data were retrieved from the weekly Notification of Infectious Disease (NOID) reports. The associations between searching and case data were explored using a time-series analyses, including cross-correlations, Prais-Winsten regression and joinpoint analysis. Significant cross-correlations were found for Measles cases and ""measles"" searching ( <i>r=</i>.41) at a lag of -1 week. For Pertussis cases, searching for ""whooping cough"" ( <i>r</i>=.31), ""cough"" ( <i>r</i>=.39), ""100 day cough"" ( <i>r</i>.41) and ""vomiting"" ( <i>r</i>=.42) were significantly correlated at a lag of -3 to -2 weeks. In multivariable regression, ""measles"" remained significantly associated with Measles cases (β=.24, SE=.33, <i>p</i>=.02) as did ""whooping cough"" (β=.71, SE=.27, <i>p</i>=.01) and ""cough"" (β=1.99, SE=.54, <i>p</i>=.001) for pertussis. Increases in Measles and Pertussis cases follow increases in online searches for both diseases and selected respective symptoms. Further work is required to explore how GT can be used in conjunction with other health surveillance systems to monitor or even predict disease outbreaks, to better target public health interventions.

[PMID: 41118020] Recent research highlights a growing link between metabolic dysregulation-particularly involving glucose and lipid metabolism-and suicidal ideation. Given the potential role that carbohydrate and fat metabolism play in suicidal ideation, it is essential to conduct a thorough examination of their joint effects. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, an innovative indicator assessing insulin resistance and overall metabolic status, shows promise in predicting mental health issues related to metabolic disorders. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between Tyg index and suicidal ideation and its influencing factors. Our study analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, covering the period from 2009 to 2018. The TyG index was derived using the equation: Ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL) / 2]. The ninth item of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 gauged ideations of suicide. Using modified multivariable logistic regression, the relationship between the TyG index and ideation of suicide was investigated in further detail. The nonlinearity was managed using smooth curve fitting, and the threshold effects of these nonlinear relationships were further investigated using a two-part linear regression model. Subgroup and interaction analyses were also performed to test the robustness of the results. Subgroup analyses were conducted by race, body mass index, and hypertensive status, while interaction terms were used to assess potential effect modification. Among the 11,551 individuals in the study, 3.55% reported experiencing suicidal ideations. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the following domains: race, degree of education, body mass index, income, diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and depressive symptoms between the groups with and without suicidal ideation. A Strong nonlinear correlation was found between suicidal ideation and an elevated TyG index; a fully adjusted model revealed a 27% increased likelihood per unit increase. In the hypertensive group, a nonlinear relationship was noted, with a threshold effect at a TyG index of 8.75. Subgroup analysis and interaction tests revealed variations in this association, particularly by race and body mass index. There was a significant positive association in obese people, but not in other groups. The study determined that an elevated TyG index may influence suicidal ideation, particularly underscoring the need for targeted interventions and routine metabolic and mental health screenings, especially in high-risk groups like obese and hypertensive individuals.",3

Matrix effect was determined by spiking the manufacturer's calibrator F simultaneously into pooled serum and aliquots of spot urine sample donated by a single volunteer. Stability was assessed without preservatives as well as 0.0032×<i>g</i> of thymol or 1 mL of 5 M hydrochloric acid. The urinary copeptin-to-creatinine ratio reference limit was derived from random spot urines collected from 120 apparently healthy volunteers who met the selection criteria. Our in-house derived urinary copeptin-to-creatinine ratio was<2.5 pmol/mmol creatinine, and there was a statistically significant difference in urinary copeptin concentration between males and females, but this was eliminated when corrected for urine creatinine. 24-h and spot urine with and without preservatives were stable for 7 days at 4-8 °C, 23-25 °C, and -20 °C. Limits of blank, limits of detection, and limit of quantitation were 1.1 pmol/L, and 1.81 pmol/L, respectively. Urine matrix does not distort the kinetics of the BRAHMS Thermo Fisher Copeptin assay and therefore could be measured with high accuracy. The clinical utility of urinary copeptin is still unknown, however, there is growing interest in this area in patient with autosomal polycystic kidney disease.

[PMID: 41185034] Kiwifruit is widely recognized for its nutritional value and health benefits, yet reliable and objective methods for assessing kiwifruit intake in populations remain limited. This study aimed to identify urinary biomarkers of kiwifruit intake and develop an optimal biomarker panel for differentiating consumers within days. A randomized, controlled, crossover dietary intervention was conducted among 17 healthy volunteers. The intervention included four phases: run-in, single-exposure, repeat-exposure, and follow-up. Urine samples at multiple time-point and fruit samples were prepared and analyzed using untargeted metabolomics via dual-column ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Candidate biomarkers were identified through a systematic statistical strategy on kinetic profiles within 24 h, and annotated for potential fruit-derived origin through spectral matching. Machine learning algorithms were employed to establish an optimal biomarker panel for assessing kiwifruit intake under habitual diet conditions. Twenty-three urinary metabolites showed significantly elevated kinetic profiles, among which 15 were matched to compounds detected in the original fruit or in vitro digestion samples. These metabolites mainly included polyphenol-related metabolites and plant-derived amino acid derivatives. The excretion of many metabolites turned to be delayed compared to those typically observed for other fruits. For example, 2-isopropylmalic acid usually peaked in urine or blood within 6 h of consuming other fruits, but in our study urinary level at 24 h was much higher compared to 6 h. Most of the selected candidates are not specific to kiwifruit based on existing literature, such as hippuric acid. In this regard, an XGBoost algorithm-based model using 7 metabolites achieved substantial discriminative performance (accuracy = 0.88) in predicting kiwifruit intake within two days. This study identified potential biomarkers of kiwifruit and developed a prediction model that may differentiate consumers. Further validation is necessary to confirm the reliability and generalizability of our findings. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2100048279. Registered on July 5, 2021.

[PMID: 41184657] Understanding gender-based foot morphological differences is critical for ergonomic footwear design. This study investigated these variations in young adults using photogrammetric and plantar pressure analysis. We analyzed 200 healthy participants (100 males, 100 females; aged 19-21 years) through digital photogrammetry and RSscan Footscan pressure mapping. Key parameters included foot length (FL), ball width (BWF), hallux valgus angle (HVd), lateral foot angle (LdF), and Clarke's Index for arch classification. Plantar pressure distribution was assessed across 10 anatomical zones. We revealed significant gender disparities: males had longer (26.6 vs. 25.2 cm) and wider feet (10.2 vs. 9.1 cm), while 75% of participants exhibited HVd (5.1°-6.3°), with no gender difference. Dynamic Clarke's Index showed 80% had high arches, correlating with lower BMI (p < 0.001). Pressure analysis highlighted higher midfoot loading (37.8-41.2 cm<sup>2</sup>) and medial forefoot pressure in HVd cases. Females predominantly wore smaller shoes (sizes 36-38), whereas 89% of males wore sizes 42-44. BMI influenced midfoot pressure (r = 0.3) and arch height, with flat arches linked to higher BMI. Foot asymmetry (38%) and HVd prevalence underscored the need for gender-specific shoe designs. It emphasize prioritizing ergonomic footwear to mitigate pressure imbalances, HVd progression, and asymmetry, particularly in high-BMI individuals. This dual-method approach provides actionable insights for biomechanical applications and footwear customization.",3

[PMID: 41186892] High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a nuclear protein, once released to the extracellular space, participates in the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Thrombomodulin alfa (TMα), a recombinant soluble protein of endothelial thrombomodulin, prevents CIPN by promoting thrombin-dependent HMGB1 degradation and activation of protein C and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI/plasma carboxypeptidase B/CPB2). We thus investigated the downstream molecules of activated protein C (APC) and TAFI (TAFIa), for prevention of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) in mice. OIPN was prevented by TMα and by each of an anti-HMGB1-neutralizing antibody (HAb), APC and porcine pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (ppCPB, used as a stable surrogate of TAFIa), or their combination at subeffective doses. Intraplantar administration of HMGB1 induced mechanical allodynia, which was abolished by TMα, but not APC or ppCPB. The anti-OIPN effects of TMα and APC were reversed by an antagonist of proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), targetable by APC, and the effect of TMα was also reversed by a CPB inhibitor. Intraplantar administration of mouse C5a (mC5a), targetable by TAFIa, caused mechanical allodynia, an effect blocked by TMα, a mC5a receptor (mC5aR) antagonist or HAb. The mC5aR antagonist prevented OIPN development. Oxaliplatin significantly increased plasma C5a levels in the mice treated with argatroban, a thrombin inhibitor, capable of reducing the degradation of HMGB1 by the endogenous thrombin-thrombomodulin axis. Our data thus suggest that the anti-OIPN effect of TMα involves APC-induced PAR1 activation and TAFIa-induced degradation of C5a that induces HMGB1-dependent pain, in addition to HMGB1 degradation.

[PMID: 41186654] The timing of anti-hypertensive medication may influence cardiovascular outcomes and blood pressure control, yet the evidence remains inconclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the effects of bedtime versus morning dosing of anti-hypertensives on mortality, cardiovascular events, and ambulatory blood pressure. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bedtime versus morning administration of antihypertensive therapy. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to June 2025. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for categorical outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous variables. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.3.3. PROSPERO registration ID: CRD420251113957. Pooled analysis of six RCTs with 49,983 patients was included. Bedtime dosing of anti-hypertensive medications resulted in a lower incidence of heart failure (1.3% vs. 2.0%; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.85) but not myocardial infarction (1.4% vs. 1.6%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64-1.17), stroke or transient ischemic attack (0.9% vs. 1.3%; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49-1.05), all-cause mortality (2.6% vs. 3.1%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53-1.06), or cardiovascular mortality (1.0% vs. 1.5%; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.22-1.21). For blood pressure, bedtime dosing significantly reduced evening systolic blood pressure (MD - 4.71 mmHg, 95% CI - 6.64 to - 2.78) and evening diastolic blood pressure (MD - 1.66 mmHg, 95% CI - 1.92 to - 1.40), with no significant differences observed in morning readings. Bedtime administration of anti-hypertensive medications may be associated with reduction in MACE and heart failure incidence.

Many patients with congenital heart disease present with glomerulosclerosis, periglomerular fibrosis and albuminuria. It remains largely unknown whether SMAD2 variants associated with congenital heart disease can directly alter kidney cell fate, tissue patterning and organ-level function. Here we investigate the role of pathogenic SMAD2 variants in podocytogenesis, nephrogenic cell lineage specification and glomerular filtration barrier function using a combination of CRISPR-based disease modelling, stem cell and microfluidic organ-on-a-chip technologies. We show that the abrogation of SMAD2 results in altered patterning of the mesoderm and intermediate mesoderm cell lineages, which give rise to nearly all kidney cell types. Following further differentiation of intermediate mesoderm cells, the mutant podocytes failed to develop arborizations and interdigitations. A reconstituted glomerulus-on-a-chip system showed substantial albumin leakage, as observed in glomerulopathies. This study implicates chronic heart disease-associated SMAD2 mutations in kidney tissue malformation that might inform targeted regenerative therapies.

[PMID: 41173005] In early blastocyst, inner cell mass (ICM) undergoes a second wave of lineage commitment to generate epiblast (Epi) and primitive endoderm (PrE), restricting the developmental potential of their progeny. However, the epigenetic mechanism underlying this lineage segregation remains unclear. Here, we reveal that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibition with EPZ-6438 transdifferentiates murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into primitive endoderm stem cells (PrESCs). Genetic ablation of Ezh2 in ESCs reduces the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) deposition at the promoters of PrE-specific genes, derepressing their expression and facilitating the PrESC conversion. Reconstitution with wild-type EZH2, but not catalytically inactive or EED-binding-deficient mutants in EZH2-deficient ESCs, blocks this transition. Strikingly, EZH2 inhibition reduces epiblast cell numbers in blastocysts, with 45.9% of embryos exhibiting ICMs composed of no SOX2-positive cells. Furthermore, EPZ-6438 treatment in human naive ESCs upregulates hypoblast-associated genes. In sum, these results reveal an evolutionarily conserved role for EZH2-polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in safeguarding pluripotency from primitive endoderm cell fate.

[PMID: 41167193] Transposable elements (TEs) occupy nearly half of the genome and drive developmental innovation, yet the mechanisms of silencing long terminal repeats (LTRs) remain incompletely understood. We demonstrate that methyltransferase-like 3 deficiency reverts naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to a totipotent-like state with reactivation and chromatin resetting of 8C-associated genes, eRNAs, and LTRs, particularly ERV1 and ERVL-MaLR. Moreover, m<sup>6</sup>A on primate-specific L1PA is found to be essential. Mechanistically, L1PA binds 8C-associated LTRs and eRNAs and regulates chromatin through RNA-scaffold complexes with chromatin regulators, where m<sup>6</sup>A directs protein-binding preference. In naive hESCs, m<sup>6</sup>A on L1PA suppresses EP300 binding to ERV1 and enhances KAP1 binding to ERVL-MaLR, thereby restricting LTR activity. In parallel, the m<sup>6</sup>A-L1PA axis or m<sup>6</sup>A on eRNAs limits EP300/H3K27ac occupancy at 8C enhancers.

Recent studies support a role for the orexin system and in particular the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) in coordinating an integrative stress response. However, no selective OX1R antagonist has been systematically tested in two preclinical models of using panicogenic stimuli that induce panic attack in the majority of people with panic disorder, namely an acute hypercapnia-panic provocation model and a model involving chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis in the perifornical hypothalamic area followed by intravenous sodium lactate infusion. Here we report on a novel brain penetrant, selective and high affinity OX1R antagonist JNJ-54717793 (1S,2R,4R)-7-([(3-fluoro-2-pyrimidin-2-ylphenyl)carbonyl]-<i>N</i>-[5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazin-2-yl]-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-amine). JNJ-54717793 is a high affinity/potent OX1R antagonist and has an excellent selectivity profile including 50 fold versus the OX2R. <i>Ex vivo</i> receptor binding studies demonstrated that after oral administration JNJ-54717793 crossed the blood brain barrier and occupied OX1Rs in the rat brain. While JNJ-54717793 had minimal effect on spontaneous sleep in rats and in wild-type mice, its administration in OX2R knockout mice, selectively promoted rapid eye movement sleep, demonstrating target engagement and specific OX1R blockade. JNJ-54717793 attenuated CO<sub>2</sub> and sodium lactate induced panic-like behaviors and cardiovascular responses without altering baseline locomotor or autonomic activity. These data confirm that selective OX1R antagonism may represent a novel approach of treating anxiety disorders, with no apparent sedative effects.

[PMID: 25583879] Orexins (OXs) are peptides produced by perifornical (PeF) and lateral hypothalamic neurons that exert a prominent role in arousal-related processes, including stress. A critical role for the orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) in complex emotional behavior is emerging, such as overactivation of the OX1R pathway being associated with panic or anxiety states. Here we characterize a brain-penetrant, selective, and high-affinity OX1R antagonist, compound 56 [N-({3-[(3-ethoxy-6-methylpyridin-2-yl)carbonyl]-3-azabicyclo[4.1.0]hept-4-yl}methyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-2-amine]. Ex vivo receptor binding studies demonstrated that, after subcutaneous administration, compound 56 crossed the blood-brain barrier and occupied OX1Rs in the rat brain at lower doses than standard OX1R antagonists GSK-1059865 [5-bromo-N-({1-[(3-fluoro-2-methoxyphenyl)carbonyl]-5-methylpiperidin-2-yl}methyl)pyridin-2-amine], SB-334867 [1-(2-methyl-1,3-benzoxazol-6-yl)-3-(1,5-naphthyridin-4-yl)urea], and SB-408124 [1-(6,8-difluoro-2-methylquinolin-4-yl)-3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]urea]. Although compound 56 did not alter spontaneous sleep in rats and in wild-type mice, its administration in orexin-2 receptor knockout mice selectively promoted rapid eye movement sleep, demonstrating target engagement and specific OX1R blockade. In a rat model of psychological stress induced by cage exchange, the OX1R antagonist prevented the prolongation of sleep onset without affecting sleep duration. In a rat model of panic vulnerability (involving disinhibition of the PeF OX region) to threatening internal state changes (i.e., intravenous sodium lactate infusion), compound 56 attenuated sodium lactate-induced panic-like behaviors and cardiovascular responses without altering baseline locomotor or autonomic activity. In conclusion, OX1R antagonism represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders associated with stress or hyperarousal states.

[PMID: 22453138] Acute hypercapnia (elevated arterial CO(2)/H(+)) is a suffocation signal that is life threatening and rapidly mobilizes adaptive changes in breathing and behavioral arousal in order to restore acid-base homeostasis. Severe hypercapnia, seen in respiratory disorders (eg, asthma or bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), also results in high anxiety and autonomic activation. Recent evidence has demonstrated that wake-promoting hypothalamic orexin (ORX: also known as hypocretin) neurons are highly sensitive to local changes in CO(2)/H(+), and mice lacking prepro-ORX have blunted respiratory responses to hypercapnia. Furthermore, in a recent clinical study, ORX-A, which crosses blood-brain barrier easily, was dramatically increased in the plasma of patients with COPD and hypercapnic respiratory failure. This is consistent with a rodent model of COPD where chronic exposure to cigarette smoke led to a threefold increase in hypothalamic ORX-A expression. In the present study, we determined the role of ORX in the anxiety-like behavior and cardiorespiratory responses to acute exposure to a threshold panic challenge (ie, 20% CO(2)/normoxic gas). Exposing conscious rats to such hypercapnic, but not atmospheric air, resulted in respiratory, pressor, and bradycardic responses, as well as anxiety-like behavior and increased cellular c-Fos responses in ORX neurons. Systemically, pre-treating rats with a centrally active ORX1 receptor antagonist (30 mg/kg SB334867) attenuated hypercapnic gas-induced pressor and anxiety responses, without altering the robust bradycardia response, and only attenuated breathing responses at offset of the CO(2) challenge. Our results show that the ORX system has an important role in anxiety and sympathetic mobilization during hypercapnia. Furthermore, ORX1 receptor antagonists may be a therapeutic option rapidly treating increased anxiety and sympathetic drive seen during panic attacks and in hypercapnic states such as COPD.",3
Hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission is unrelated to energy balance.,hypothalamic glutamate AND neurotransmission AND energy balance AND regulation,"34654752,33441043,32719118","[PMID: 34654752] Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are essential for reproduction, but their role in the control of energy balance and other homeostatic functions remains unclear. High-frequency firing of hypothalamic arcuate Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons releases kisspeptin into the median eminence, and neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin onto neighboring Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to generate a slow EPSP mediated by TRPC5 channels that entrains intermittent, synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. High-frequency optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also releases glutamate to excite the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and inhibit the orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons via metabotropic glutamate receptors. At the molecular level, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is critically involved in the regulation of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and neuronal excitability through its interaction with plasma membrane (PM) calcium (e.g., TRPC) channels. Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons would increase neuronal excitability and their synchronous firing, which ultimately would affect energy homeostasis. Using optogenetics in combination with whole-cell recording and GCaMP6 imaging in slices, we discovered that deletion of <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1 neurons significantly increased the amplitude and duration of the slow EPSP and augmented synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i oscillations in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Deletion of <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons amplified the actions of NKB and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD). Therefore, STIM1 appears to play a critical role in regulating synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, which ultimately affects the coordination between energy homeostasis and reproduction.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons are essential for stimulating the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and maintaining fertility. However, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons appear to be a key player in coordinating energy balance with reproduction. The regulation of calcium channels and hence calcium signaling is critically dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) calcium channels. We have conditionally deleted <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and found that it significantly increased the excitability of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD).

[PMID: 33441043] To maintain metabolic homeostasis, motivated behaviors are driven by neuronal circuits that process information encoding the animal's energy state. Such circuits likely include ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) glutamatergic neurons that project throughout the brain to drive food intake and energy expenditure. Targets of VMH glutamatergic neurons include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus that, when activated, inhibit food intake. Although an energy-state-sensitive, glutamate circuit between the VMH and POMC neurons has been previously indicated, the significance and details of this circuit have not been fully elucidated. Thus, the goal of the present work was to add to the understanding of this circuit. Using a knockout strategy, the data show that the VMH glutamate→POMC neuron circuit is important for the inhibition of food intake. Conditional deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT2) in the VMH results in increased bodyweight and increased food intake following a fast in both male and female mice. Additionally, the targeted blunting of glutamate release from the VMH resulted in an ∼32% reduction in excitatory inputs to POMC cells, suggesting that this circuit may respond to changes in energy state to affect POMC activity. Indeed, we found that glutamate release is increased at VMH-to-POMC synapses during feeding and POMC AMPA receptors switch from a calcium-permeable state to a calcium-impermeable state during fasting. Collectively, these data indicate that there is an energy-balance-sensitive VMH-to-POMC circuit conveying excitatory neuromodulation onto POMC cells at both pre- and postsynaptic levels, which may contribute to maintaining appropriate food intake and body mass.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Despite decades of research, the neurocircuitry underlying metabolic homeostasis remains incompletely understood. Specifically, the roles of amino acid transmitters, particularly glutamate, have received less attention than hormonal signals. Here, we characterize an energy-state-sensitive glutamate circuit from the ventromedial hypothalamus to anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that responds to changes in energy state at both sides of the synapse, providing novel information about how variations in metabolic state affect excitatory drive onto POMC cells.

[PMID: 32719118] The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) plays chief roles regulating energy and glucose homeostasis and is sexually dimorphic. We discovered that expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) in the VMH is regulated by caloric status in normal mice and reduced in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mutants, which are severely obese and have diminished glucose balance control. These findings led us to investigate whether mGluR5 might act downstream of BDNF to critically regulate VMH neuronal activity and metabolic function. We found that mGluR5 depletion in VMH SF1 neurons did not affect energy balance regulation. However, it significantly impaired insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, lipid metabolism, and sympathetic output in females but not in males. These sex-specific deficits are linked to reductions in intrinsic excitability and firing rate of SF1 neurons. Abnormal excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly and elevated expression of the GABAergic synthetic enzyme GAD67 also cooperate to decrease and potentiate the synaptic excitatory and inhibitory tone onto mutant SF1 neurons, respectively. Notably, these alterations arise from disrupted functional interactions of mGluR5 with estrogen receptors that switch the normally positive effects of estrogen on SF1 neuronal activity and glucose balance control to paradoxical and detrimental. The collective data inform an essential central mechanism regulating metabolic function in females and underlying the protective effects of estrogen against metabolic disease.",3

However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNcDA neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNcDA neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41187334] Hexokinase domain containing protein 1 (HKDC1) is a recently discovered fifth human hexokinase isozyme that is significantly upregulated in several disease states, including lung and liver cancers. Cellular studies suggest that HKDC1 is a low activity hexokinase; however, its functional characteristics have remained enigmatic. Here, we describe the kinetic and regulatory features of recombinant human HKDC1, demonstrating it to be a robust hexokinase (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub> = 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) with a unique glucose <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value (0.49 ± 0.07 mM) that differs markedly from all other human hexokinase isozymes. The isolated C-terminal domain of HKDC1 displays kinetic characteristics nearly identical to the full-length enzyme, whereas the N-terminal domain is inactive. Unlike all other 100 kDa vertebrate hexokinases characterized to date, HKDC1 is insensitive to product inhibition by physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate, with apparent inhibition constants above 1 mM. The hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is also insensitive to Dinaciclib, a pan cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that reportedly disrupts the ability of nuclear localized HKDC1 to phosphorylate retinoblastoma-binding protein 5. Conversely, the hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is potently inhibited by a synthetic glucosamine derivative previously developed for hexokinase 1 and 2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 103 ± 6 nM. An HKDC1 variant associated with retinitis pigmentosa, T58M, displays a modest, but statistically significant 2-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub>) compared to the wild-type enzyme. Together, our results provide a detailed functional characterization of recombinant HKDC1 and set the stage for investigating the link between HKDC1 catalysis and human disease.

[PMID: 41187049] Plasmodium falciparum hexose transporter 1 protein or PfHT1 is the major glucose transporter of the parasite and indispensable for its survival at the blood stage of infection. PfHT1 transports the hexose sugar to meet the energy demand of the parasite. Studying the mechanism of transport and designing structure specific inhibitors against PfHT1 is an intelligent strategy to kill malaria parasite by starving it out because at the blood stage the sole carbon source of Plasmodium falciparum is glucose. In this study the conformational dynamics of PfHT1 has been studied in detail in the apo and holo (inhibitor bound) form using Molecular Dynamics Simulation, which reveals that PfHT1 undergoes ligand induced closed state if compared with the apo form. The geometry of ligand binding pocket also shifts from the apo form in the presence of inhibitors. The lead molecules were obtained from screening nearly 4500 compounds. A de novo drug designing approach based on the skeleton of the leads, has produced inhibitors of PfHT1 with higher specificity and affinity. The drug screening data as well as the conformational dynamics study was validated using Molecular Dynamics Simulation. In simulation a near physiological environment was created for PfHT1 by constructing a lipid phase (phospholipid bilayer) sandwiched between aqueous phases (mimics extracellular and cytosolic polar environment).",3

DS symptoms include pyrexia, respiratory compromise, increased body mass, fluid accumulation, pulmonary infiltrates, hypotension, tachycardia, edema, and sepsis. It can also affect the kidneys and the central nervous system. The standard treatment to counteract DS involves the temporary cessation of ATRA or arsenic trioxide treatment and the administration of high-dose steroids to mitigate the inflammatory response. If left untreated, DS can be fatal. Further research has revealed that the inability to promptly recognize intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with APL may result in lethal consequences, with the cytokine storm identified as the principal factor in this scenario as well. ATRA therapy is known to induce transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which functions as a catalyst for DS development. In this study, we used NB4 cell lines and cells from a human patient with APL to investigate the ex vivo effects of ATRA and 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> cotreatment on NF-κB-regulated luciferase reporter gene activity. ATRA alone substantially enhanced cellular NF-κB luciferase reporter gene activity, whereas 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> dose-dependently reduced this activity. During ATRA-initiated cell maturation, 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, known as calcidiol, suppressed the mRNA expression of NF-κB (p65/p50) and Rel family members, as well as the expression of genes associated with increased NF-κB activity. 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> also inhibited the ATRA-induced production of cytokines (e.g., IL-8), including IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1, associated with the ""cytokine storm."" Combined treatment with ATRA plus 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> reduced cellular phospho-p65 and transglutaminase 2 (TG2) levels and increased the level of inhibitor of Rel (IκB), thereby attenuating the cytokine storm. These findings provide a molecular interpretation for clinical DS and IHC observations and may support future exploration of ATRA plus 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> cotreatment as a therapy for APL.

[PMID: 22366952] Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder in which mucosal autoantibodies to the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are generated in response to the exogenous antigen gluten in individuals who express human leukocyte antigen HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 (ref. 3). We assessed in a comprehensive and nonbiased manner the IgA anti-TG2 response by expression cloning of the antibody repertoire of ex vivo-isolated intestinal antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). We found that TG2-specific plasma cells are markedly expanded within the duodenal mucosa in individuals with active celiac disease. TG2-specific antibodies were of high affinity yet showed little adaptation by somatic mutations. Unlike infection-induced peripheral blood plasmablasts, the TG2-specific ASCs had not recently proliferated and were not short-lived ex vivo. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that there is a germline repertoire with high affinity for TG2 that may favor massive generation of autoreactive B cells. TG2-specific antibodies did not block enzymatic activity and served as substrates for TG2-mediated crosslinking when expressed as IgD or IgM but not as IgA1 or IgG1. This could result in preferential recruitment of plasma cells from naive IgD- and IgM-expressing B cells, thus possibly explaining why the antibody response to TG2 bears signs of a primary immune response despite the disease chronicity.",2

We sought to examine how the genetic variants of the MSY influence male susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis. Approach and Results: Analysis of 129 133 men from UK Biobank revealed that only one of 7 common MSY haplogroups (haplogroup I1) was associated with CAD-carriers of haplogroup I1 had ≈11% increase in risk of CAD when compared with all other haplogroups combined (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18; <i>P</i>=6.8×10<sup>-4</sup>). Targeted MSY sequencing uncovered 235 variants exclusive to this haplogroup. The haplogroup I1-specific variants showed 2.45- and 1.56-fold respective enrichment for promoter and enhancer chromatin states, in cells/tissues relevant to atherosclerosis, when compared with other MSY variants. Gene set enrichment analysis in CAD-relevant tissues showed that haplogroup I1 was associated with changes in pathways responsible for early and late stages of atherosclerosis development including defence against pathogens, immunity, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial respiration, lipids, coagulation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. <i>UTY</i> was the only Y chromosome gene whose blood expression was associated with haplogroup I1. Experimental reduction of <i>UTY</i> expression in macrophages led to changes in expression of 59 pathways (28 of which overlapped with those associated with haplogroup I1) and a significant reduction in the immune costimulatory signal. Haplogroup I1 is enriched for regulatory chromatin variants in numerous cells of relevance to CAD and increases cardiovascular risk through proatherosclerotic reprogramming of the transcriptome, partly through <i>UTY</i>.",1

Clinical features include cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen therapy, chocolate-colored blood, and a marked saturation gap between pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas. Methylene blue remains the cornerstone of treatment; however, in rare instances, patients may exhibit refractory responses necessitating advanced interventions. Literature documenting methemoglobinemia due to fungicides like azoxystrobin and propiconazole remains scarce. A young female presented with altered sensorium, shock, and hypoxia following the ingestion of a fungicide containing azoxystrobin and propiconazole. Despite a PaO₂ of 400 mmHg on ABG, pulse oximetry showed 83% oxygen saturation, raising suspicion of dyshemoglobinemia. Methemoglobin levels were elevated at 80.7%. She was treated with intravenous methylene blue. While an initial decline in methemoglobin levels to 4% was observed, relapse occurred within 12 h. On day three, therapeutic red blood cell exchange transfusion was performed resulting in a reduction of methemoglobin levels to 14.2%. Despite aggressive measures, she succumbed to refractory shock on day five of admission. This report presents likely the first documented case of fatal methemoglobinemia due to ingestion of azoxystrobin and propiconazole-a combination fungicide widely used in agriculture. The case highlights the limitations of standard therapies like methylene blue in severe poisoning and underscores the need for early consideration of exchange transfusion. With the increasing use of such agents in rural communities, clinicians must maintain vigilance for unusual toxicities and ensure timely escalation in refractory cases.

[PMID: 41184355] Given the nutritional importance of bread in the Iranian diet, ensuring its safety regarding chemical contaminants is crucial. This study assesses the potential health risks posed by heavy metals in bread available in Iran. A total of 248 bread samples were collected from 11 provinces during winter 2020. After sample preparation, the concentration of heavy metals was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. A health risk assessment model was employed to evaluate health effects and carcinogenic potential. The average concentrations of Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Cadmium (Cd), Aluminum (Al), Cobalt (Co), Lead (Pb), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), and Mercury (Hg) were 3.08 ± 1.24, 13.6 ± 44.94, 59.24 ± 30.62, 0.004 ± 0.02, 4.98 ± 2.85, 0.01 ± 0.03, 0.65 ± 1.71, 1 ± 1.42, 0.05 ± 0.23, and 0.03 ± 0.12 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Notably, the levels of Pb (0.65 ± 1.71 mg/kg) and Cr (1 ± 1.42 mg/kg) exceeded the WHO/FAO and Iranian National Standards threshold levels for both children and adults, indicating potential health risks. Overall, these findings suggest potential health and carcinogenic risks associated with heavy metals contamination in bread. Continuous monitoring of wheat and derived products is recommended to safeguard public health.

However, only 15-45% of untreated DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer, so understanding mechanisms that prevent progression is key to avoid overtreatment and provides a basis for alternative therapies and prevention. This study was designed to characterize the tumor microenvironment and molecular profile of high-risk DCIS that grew to a large size but remained as DCIS. All patients had DCIS lesions >5cm in size with at least one additional high-risk feature: young age (<45 years), high nuclear grade, hormone receptor negativity, HER2 positivity, the presence of comedonecrosis, or a palpable mass. The tumor immune microenvironment was characterized using multiplex immunofluorescence to identify immune cells and their spatial relationships within the ducts and stroma. Gene copy number analysis and whole exome DNA sequencing identified the mutational burden and driver mutations, and quantitative whole-transcriptome/gene expression analyses were performed. There was no association between the percent of the DCIS genome characterized by copy number variants (CNAs) and recurrence events (DCIS or invasive). Mutations, especially missense mutations, in the breast cancer driver genes <i>PIK3CA</i> and <i>TP53</i> were common in this high-risk DCIS cohort (47% of evaluated lesions). Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density was higher in DCIS lesions with TP53 mutations (p=0.0079) compared to wildtype lesions, but not in lesions with <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations (p=0.44). Immune infiltrates were negatively associated with hormone receptor status and positively associated with HER2 expression. High levels of CD3+CD8- T cells were associated with good outcomes with respect to any subsequent recurrence (DCIS or invasive cancer), whereas high levels of CD3+Foxp3+ Treg cells were associated with poor outcomes. Spatial proximity analyses of immune cells and tumor cells demonstrated that close proximity of T cells with tumor cells was associated with good outcomes with respect to any recurrence as well as invasive recurrences. Interestingly, we found that myoepithelial continuity (distance between myoepithelial cells surrounding the involved ducts) was significantly lower in DCIS lesions compared to normal tissue (p=0.0002) or to atypical ductal hyperplasia (p=0.011). Gene set enrichment analysis identified several immune pathways associated with low myoepithelial continuity and a low myoepithelial continuity score was associated with better outcomes, suggesting that gaps in the myoepithelial layer may allow access/interactions between immune infiltrates and tumor cells. Our study demonstrates the immune microenvironment of DCIS, in particular the spatial proximity of tumor cells and T cells, and myoepithelial continuity are important determinants for progression of disease.

[PMID: 37190184] In breast cancer, progression to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) involves interactions between immune, myoepithelial, and tumor cells. Development of IDC can proceed through ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-obligate, non-invasive stage, or IDC can develop without evidence of DCIS and these cases associate with poorer prognosis. Tractable, immune-competent mouse models are needed to help delineate distinct mechanisms of local tumor cell invasion and prognostic implications. To address these gaps, we delivered murine mammary carcinoma cell lines directly into the main mammary lactiferous duct of immune-competent mice. Using two strains of immune-competent mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6), one immune-compromised (severe combined immunodeficiency; SCID) C57BL/6 strain, and six different murine mammary cancer cell lines (D2.OR, D2A1, 4T1, EMT6, EO771, Py230), we found early loss of ductal myoepithelial cell differentiation markers p63, α-smooth muscle actin, and calponin, and rapid formation of IDC in the absence of DCIS. Rapid IDC formation also occurred in the absence of adaptive immunity. Combined, these studies demonstrate that loss of myoepithelial barrier function does not require an intact immune system, and suggest that these isogenic murine models may prove a useful tool to study IDC in the absence of a non-obligatory DCIS stage-an under-investigated subset of poor prognostic human breast cancer.

[PMID: 37506511] The heterogeneous cell population in the stromal microenvironment is considered to be attributed to the multiple sources from which the cells originate. Tumor associated myoepithelial cells (TAMEs) are one of the most important populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) especially in breast cancer. On the other hand, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have previously been described to be the origin of tumor-associated cellular components in the TME. We prepared a cancer stem cell model converting mouse-induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) in the presence of conditioned medium of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells. The converted cells developed tumors progressing into invasive carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) like structure when transplanted into mouse mammary fat pads. The primary cultured cells from the tumor further exhibited markers of CSC such as Sox2, Oct3/4, - CD133 and EpCAM, and mammary gland-related TAME markers such as α-smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin 8, whey acidic protein, prolactin receptor and progesterone receptor as well. These results indicated that the CSCs could be an origin of TAMEs contributing to mammary gland epithelial cell differentiation and the progression to invasive carcinoma during tumor development. The gene expression profiles confirmed the enhanced signaling pathways of PI3K/AKT and MAPK, which have been demonstrated to be enriched in the CSC models, together with the estrogen receptor signaling which was peculiar to mammary gland-derived character.",3

[PMID: 40174861] Systemic RV dysfunction is a significant prognostic factor in congenital heart disease, particularly affecting patients with transposition of the great arteries post-atrial switch and congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. These patients often experience chronic pressure loading conditions, leading to structural, mechanical, and electrical adaptations that can result in heart failure. This article reviews novel therapeutic approaches for managing systemic right ventricular failure in patients with adult congenital heart disease, focusing on pharmacologic, device-based, and advanced heart failure therapies. Traditional heart failure medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have shown mixed results in systemic right ventricular failure. However, newer agents like angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have demonstrated promising outcomes in improving cardiac remodeling and function. Cardiac resynchronization therapy has shown benefits in selected patients, particularly those with prior ventricular pacing. Mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation remain viable options for advanced heart failure, with recent studies indicating favourable long-term outcomes. The management of systemic right ventricular failure requires a personalized approach, considering the unique anatomic and physiological characteristics of each patient. Although traditional therapies have limited efficacy, novel pharmacologic and device-based treatments might offer new hope for this patient population. Further research is needed to refine these strategies and identify new therapeutic targets.",3

However, evidence remains limited regarding the cardiovascular risks associated with methylphenidate use in children and adolescents who have heart disease or a family history of cardiovascular conditions. We conducted a self-controlled case series (SCCS) study using Taiwan's nationwide insurance database (2004-2021), which links data from births registered in the National Health Insurance system. A total of 2,493 individuals with ADHD, at least one methylphenidate prescription, and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) were enrolled. A stratified Cox regression model adjusted for time-varying confounders was used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of arrhythmias, ischaemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease during methylphenidate exposure compared with those during unexposed periods. Effect modification by congenital heart disease and family history of CVD was also assessed. We found a significantly increased risk of arrhythmias during both the exposed period (RR: 1.41, 95% CI (Confidence Interval): 1.21-1.63) and the pre-exposed period (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.15-1.96). No significant association was observed between methylphenidate use and the risk of ischaemic heart disease (RR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.49-1.50) or cerebrovascular disease (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.45-1.39). A family history of CVD did not affect cardiovascular risk. However, individuals with congenital heart diseases had an elevated risk of arrhythmias during the pre-exposed period (RR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.47-6.94) but not during the exposed period. These findings suggest that methylphenidate use is not significantly associated with ischaemic heart disease or cerebrovascular events in ADHD youth, even those with a family history of CVD or congenital heart diseases. The relationship between methylphenidate and the increased risk of arrhythmias during both the exposed and pre-exposed periods needs further investigation.

[PMID: 41182792] Neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) are common, lifelong conditions that typically manifest during childhood. Cumulatively, approximately 15% of children globally have an NDC. NDCs have been associated with increased mortality risk, although extant literature pertains mostly to adults or to specific NDCs. To assess the mortality risk for youth aged 0 to 24 years with and without NDCs, for specific NDC groups, and by sex. A national 15-year birth cohort study of 888 975 youth from 1995 to 2009 in Aotearoa New Zealand. Cox proportional hazard models compared mortality risk after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Statistical analysis was conducted from August 17, 2024, to August 27, 2025. Youth with NDCs. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome, with medical, injury, and suicide cause-specific mortality as secondary outcomes. Of the 888 975 youths in the birth cohort, NDCs were identified in 40 071 (4.5%) (mean [SD] age at NDC diagnosis of 8.5 [4.6] years; 10 605 [26.5%] were female). Mortality risk was significantly higher for youth with NDCs compared with those without NDCs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 4.67 [95% CI, 4.13-5.28]) and higher for female individuals with NDCs compared with female individuals without NDCs (aHR, 9.69 [95% CI, 7.93-11.84]). Mortality risk was higher for all specific NDCs, including specific learning and motor disorders (aHR, 8.50 [95% CI, 7.11-10.16]), intellectual disability (aHR, 8.27 [95% CI, 6.92-9.89]), communication and language disorders (aHR, 6.06 [95% CI, 4.14-8.86]), autism (aHR, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.94-3.42]), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (aHR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.67-2.54]) compared with those without these respective conditions. Cause-specific mortality risk for those with any NDC was notably higher for medical-related deaths (aHR, 12.13 [95% CI, 10.31-14.28]) but also significantly higher for injury (aHR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.42-2.48]) and suicide (aHR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.21-2.37]) compared with those without NDCs. This population-level birth cohort study revealed a significantly higher mortality risk among youth with NDCs, especially female individuals, and marked variation in mortality risk by NDC diagnosis. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted health care interventions, improved access to medical and mental health services, and systemic changes to address the social and structural barriers that contribute to health inequities.

[PMID: 41185422] Conduct disorder and childhood head injuries frequently co-occur and are linked to a higher risk of later delinquency. While both are known to disrupt reward-related neural circuits, this study investigated whether their combined presence leads to a unique disruption in these pathways, potentially accounting for the increased risk of delinquency. Using neuroimaging data from the baseline (age 9-10) assessment from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, four groups were compared: children with conduct disorder (CD, <i>n</i> = 588), a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, <i>n</i> = 1,216), both (mTBI+CD, <i>n</i> = 252), and typically developing controls (TD, <i>n</i> = 705). Neural activation in eight regions of interest (amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, caudal anterior cingulate cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, and insula) during reward anticipation and receipt were assessed during the monetary incentive delay task. After controlling for several covariates, including sex, ADHD, and internalizing problems, the mTBI+CD group displayed greater left amygdala and hippocampal activation during reward receipt compared to all other groups. While they displayed increased activation in the right hippocampus and thalamus compared to TD controls and the right hippocampus compared to the mTBI group, they did not differ from the CD group. No group differences emerged during reward anticipation. Increased left amygdala and hippocampus activation in children with conduct disorder and a history of mild traumatic brain injury may reflect robust encoding of emotionally charged reward experiences, potentially reinforcing memory-guided, reward-seeking behaviors.",3

Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) were extracted from mulberries using ultrasound-assisted acid, alkali, and enzymatic extraction processes. The structural and functional characteristics were systematically analyzed. The highest yield of SDF (23.61 %) obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction. Structural analysis showed that both IDF and SDF had a loose and porous structure with several exposed functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Functional experiments showed that IDF exhibited superior cholesterol- and nitrite-adsorption capacities compared with SDF. IDF and SDF obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities for glucose, cholesterol, and nitrite. In conclusion, ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction simultaneously enhances both the yield and functional properties of dietary fiber extracted from mulberry, providing an effective strategy for developing high-value functional ingredients and promoting sustainable utilization of the fruit.

[PMID: 41187366] The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, primarily through mechanisms involving carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Aberrant FGFR1 signalling has been implicated in various cancers, including lung, breast, neck and urothelial carcinoma. Despite the recognized oncogenic potential of FGFR1, therapeutic strategies targeting its kinase domain remain inadequately explored. This underscores an urgent need for the development of novel FGFR1 inhibitors, particularly through de novo drug design approaches, to effectively counteract FGFR1-driven malignancies. This research aims to develop novel FGFR1 inhibitors through a multi-step approach involving fragment-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and density functional theory studies (DFT), with the goal of targeting FGFR1's kinase binding domain to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Initially, known FGFR inhibitor molecules were retrieved and subjected to fragment-based drug designing and virtual screening. Through thorough analysis, molecules containing the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold were identified as promising candidates. A pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based database containing 90,952 molecules was subsequently retrieved from PubChem and filtered using molecular docking-based virtual screening resulting 94 molecules having better binding affinity than derazantinib, reference drug. After pharmacokinetic profiling (ADME), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) studies, out of 94 molecules only 11 compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and superior MM-GBSA binding free energies were selected. Docking-based screening revealed that selected 11 compounds demonstrated better binding scores than the reference drug, derazantinib. Among them, HIT1, was selected for 150ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess its conformational stability. DFT calculations further confirmed its bio-feasibility by analyzing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Overall, the selected lead compounds exhibited enhanced binding affinity, superior conformational stability, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to derazantinib. Present findings suggest that the identified hit molecules hold strong potential for inhibiting FGFR1's kinase domain and disrupting FGFR-associated tumor angiogenesis.

[PMID: 41187357] To examine relationships among caregiver burden, parenting competence, and related factors in parents providing home-based care for children with medical complexity. We used a descriptive correlational, cross-sectional design and conducted path analysis. Convenience sampling was employed via pediatric visiting nurse stations in Kyoto and Shiga, Japan. Self-administered questionnaires were returned by 91 parents. The short version of the Japanese version of the Zarit Burden Interview and the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale were used. Analyses were performed in SPSS v29 and AMOS v29. After assessing all variable correlations, a path analysis was conducted to examine the direct and indirect effects of caregiver burden, parenting satisfaction, self-efficacy, and related variables. Caregiver burden negatively influenced parenting satisfaction (β = -0.383, p < .001) and was associated with inadequate rest (β = -0.271, p = .006) and shorter sleep duration (β = -0.228, p = .021). Higher medical complexity scores predicted greater parenting satisfaction (β = 0.202, p = .024) but were correlated with providing nighttime care (r = 0.275, p < .001), which reduced sleep duration. Model fit was adequate (goodness-of-fit index = 0.879; comparative fit index = 0.918; root mean square error of approximation = 0.043). Caregiver burden was a key factor affecting parenting competence among parents. Interventions aimed at reducing caregiver burden, such as facilitating adequate sleep and rest, may enhance their parenting competence. Future studies should recruit larger and more diverse samples and use longitudinal designs to increase generalizability and clarify temporal relationships.",3
Incidence of heart failure increased by 10% in women since 1979.,heart failure incidence AND women AND increase since 1979 AND epidemiology,"39673102,30646164,29619932","[PMID: 39673102] Heart failure (HF) is increasing in the United States, and awareness is needed for prevention. Hypertension is the leading cause of HF, and adherence to antihypertensive medication is critical for reducing HF risk. Self-efficacy positively influences health-promoting behaviors. Assess HF awareness, test associations with antihypertensive medication adherence, and self-efficacy for managing chronic conditions. We conducted a cross-sectional, observational survey research study. We leveraged data from participants enrolled in the American Heart Association's Research Goes Red™ registry, an online platform powered by Verily. Three surveys ascertained HF awareness, blood pressure management, and self-efficacy. Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank sum determined associations between survey domains and participant characteristics. Two thousand three hundred twenty women took the HF awareness survey, 678 the blood pressure management survey, and 755 the self-efficacy survey (response rates: 12%, 78%, and 76%, respectively). Participants were predominantly non-Hispanic White (78%), with a median age of 51 (interquartile range (IQR): 39, 62). Median HF awareness score was 4/5 (IQR: 4, 5). Participants with high HF awareness versus low were more likely to be older (<i>p</i> < 0.001), non-Hispanic White (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and less likely to smoke (<i>p</i> < 0.001) or have depression (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Nearly 90% of hypertensive participants reported medication adherence, which was not associated with HF awareness or self-efficacy. Participants with greater self-efficacy versus less were more likely to have higher HF awareness (<i>p</i> = 0.01), be older (<i>p</i> = 0.01), and less likely to have depression (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Women's awareness of HF and adherence to antihypertensive medication in this cohort was high. Depression and younger age may be important factors affecting women's HF awareness and confidence in managing chronic disease medication plans.

[PMID: 30646164] Having a child with a major birth defect can be a life-changing and stressful event that may be associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet the long-term burden of CVD for the child's mother is unknown. To assess whether mothers of an infant born with a major congenital anomaly are at higher risk of CVD compared with a comparison cohort. A population-based cohort study using individual-level linked registry data in Denmark included 42 943 women who gave birth to an infant with a major congenital anomaly between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 2013; and follow-up was conducted until 2015. A comparison group, comprising 428 401 randomly selected women, was 10:1 matched to each affected mother by maternal age, parity, and her infant's year of birth. Data analyses were performed between November 1, 2017, and February 28, 2018. Live birth of an infant with a major congenital anomaly. The primary outcome was a CVD composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stroke. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the CVD composite and other cardiovascular outcomes, including unstable angina, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and aortic aneurysm. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses generated hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for maternal demographic, socioeconomic, and chronic health indicators. Median maternal age at baseline was 28.8 years (interquartile range, 25.3-32.5 years). After a median follow-up of 19.5 years (interquartile range, 9.9-27.6 years), 914 women whose infant had a major congenital anomaly experienced a CVD event (1.21 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.13-1.28 per 1000 person-years) vs 7516 women in the comparison group (0.99 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.97-1.01 per 1000 person-years), corresponding to an unadjusted HR of 1.23 (95% CI, 1.15-1.32), and an adjusted HR (aHR) of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.07-1.23). Women who gave birth to an infant with multiorgan anomalies had an even higher aHR (1.37; 95% CI, 1.08-1.72). Mothers of infants with a major anomaly also had an increased aHR of the individual components of the composite outcome and the other cardiovascular outcomes. Women whose child had a major congenital anomaly experienced a 15% to 37% higher risk of premature cardiovascular disease. These women may benefit from targeted interventions aimed at improving their cardiovascular health.

[PMID: 29619932] Ostegenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary disease of the connective tissue caused by mutations to, mainly, the genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of collagen type 1. Patients are grouped according to clinical severity and mode of inheritance according to Sillence's classification (originally 1979, updated 2014). According to our data, the population prevalence of OI in Denmark was 10.3 per 100,000, with 575 patients registered with an OI diagnosis in the National Patient Register and alive at the end of 2012 out of a total population of 5,602,628 persons. Hallmarks of the disease are multiple fractures, blue sclera and varying degrees of bone deformities. Collagen type 1 is the most abundant collagen in the body and is an important part of the structure and function of the heart and lungs, the skeleton and many other organs. We hypothesize that patients with OI will have increased prevalence and risk of fractures throughout life, lower bone mineral density (BMD), impaired bone microstructure and bone geometry and increased risk of cardiovascular diseasesthus increased risk of all cause mortality compared to the general population.  This thesis is a systematic search and narrative review covering the four main areas of interest of the PhD scholarship (risk and causes of death, fracture rates, bone mineral density, -geometry and -microstructure and cardiovascular diseases in OI). In addition to the review the thesis include the following four studies:  1) Study 1 aimed to investigate the main causes of death and the risk of premature death in patients with OI in Denmark. We used a nationwide, registry-based, cohort study design, and included all patients registered in the National Patient Register with an OI diagnosis and a matched reference population randomly selected from the Danish Civil Service Register (matched 5:1, on gender and month and year of birth for each OI patient). We identified 687 patients with OI (25,615 person years at risk) and a reference population of 3,435 (132,131 person years at risk). One hundred and twelve patients with OI and 257 persons in the reference population died during the observation period from 1977 to 2013. The all-cause mortality hazard ratio between the OI cohort and the reference population was 2.90. The median survival time for men with OI was 72.4 years, compared to 81.9 in the reference population. The median survival time for women with OI was 77.4 years, compared to 84.5 years in the reference population. Patients with OI had a higher risk of death from respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases and trauma.  Conclusion: The all-cause hazard ratio for premature death in OI was 2.9 compared to the reference population. There was an increased risk of death due to respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases and death following trauma.  2) Study 2 aimed to compare the fracture rates across the lifespan of patients with OI with that of the general population. Using a nationwide, registry-based, cohort study design, we counted all fractures registered from 1995 in the National Patient Register. The study included the same population as in study 1, but patients who died before 1995 were excluded. We identified 644 patients   (55.6% females) in the OI cohort through the Danish National Patient Register and 3,361 persons (55.2% females), randomly selected from the Civil Registry System. A total of 416 patients with OI experienced a total of 1,566 fractures during the observation period of median 17.9 years (IQ-range: 12.4-18.0), adding up to 10,137 person years. In comparison, 709 persons in the reference population experienced a total of 1,018 fractures during follow-up. Both male and female patients with OI had an increased fracture rate throughout their life. The fracture rate ratio for participants aged 0-19 years was 10.7, for participants aged 20-54 years 17.2, and for participants aged 55 years and over 4.1 when compared to the reference population. The highest fracture rate was seen in males with OI aged 0-19 years (257 fractures per 1,000 person years). The fractures appear to follow the same pattern as in the general population, with a peak during the toddler and adolescent years (IR (incidence rates) 233.9 per 1,000 person years), fewer fractures during adulthood (IR 84.5 per 1000 person years), and increased fracture rate in older women (IR 111.9 per 1,000 person years).  Conclusion: Patients with OI have increased risk of fractures throughout life compared to the general population. The relative risk of fractures generally declines with age, however, increases in older women.  3) Study 3 aimed to evaluate the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone geometry and -microarchitecture in patients with OI type I using a cross-sectional study design and evaluating the participants using HRpQCT. The study included 39 patients with OI type I, and 39 healthy age and gender matched non-OI individuals. The patients were shorter than the reference group (159 ± 10 cm versus 170 ± 9 cm, p < 0.001), but had similar body weight. In patients with OI, areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was 8% lower at the hip (p < 0.05) and 13% lower at the spine (p < 0.001) compared with the reference group. The trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) was 28% lower in radius (p < 0.001) and 38% lower in tibia (p < 0.001) in patients with OI compared with the reference group. At radius, total bone area was 5% lower in OI patients than in controls (p < 0.05). In the tibia, cortical bone area was 18% lower in patients with OI (p < 0.001). In both radius and tibia the number of trabeculae was lower in patients compared to the reference group (35% and 38%, respectively, p < 0.001 at both sites). Furthermore, trabecular spacing was 55% higher in OI patients in both tibia and radius (p < 0.001 at both sites) when compared with reference group.  Conclusion: Patients with type I OI have lower aBMD, vBMD, bone area, and trabecular number when compared with healthy age- and gender-matched individuals.  4) Study 4 aimed to evaluate the risk of valvulopathies, atrial arrhythmias, heart failure and vascular dissections in patients with OI using a nationwide, registry-based, cohort study design. The study included the same population as in study 1. As patients with OI have increased risk of premature death, the risk of cardiovascular diseases is biased by the competing risk of death. We corrected for this increased risk by using a competing risk regression model. We found that the OI population had increased relative risk of mitral valve regurgitation (sub hazard ratio (SHR) 6.3), aortic valve regurgitation (SHR 4.5), atrial fibrillation/flutters (SHR 1.7) and heart failure (SHR 2.3) compared to the reference population. There was no difference in the risk of arterial aneurisms or arterial dissections.  Conclusion: Patients with OI have increased risk of valvulopathies, atrial arrhythmias and heart failure when compared to the reference population, even after adjusting for risk factors for these car-diovascular diseases - indicating that the quantitative or qualitative defects of collagen type 1 synthesis seen in OI influence the risk of these cardiovascular diseases in patients with OI.",3

Patients with non-valvular AF and high thromboembolic risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc > 2 points) were included. LAAO was compared against the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 11, 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-E, while statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.4.1. A total of 10 studies with 5,779 patients were analyzed (2,916 with LAAO and 2,863 with anticoagulation). LAAO reduced, though without statistical significance, the incidence of ischemic stroke (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09). However, it showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the overall anticoagulant group (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.80; p = 0.0004). LAAO emerges as a viable strategy to reduce mortality in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, particularly when long-term anticoagulation is not feasible. Its superiority over DOACs and comparable profile to VKAs, along with the absence of periodic INR monitoring and relevant drug interactions, make it an option that may optimize adherence and quality of life.

[PMID: 41187295] Unfortunately, some lumbar fusion patients will experience psychological distress and a deterioration of mental health postoperatively. At the extreme, these changes can lead to self-harm and suicide. This study evaluated the incidence of self-harm within 1 year of elective lumbar fusion procedures to identify risk factors for self-harm events. The PearlDiver Mariner 170 data set from 2010 to 2023 was retrospectively analyzed. Patients undergoing 1-level to 3-level posterior lumbar fusion with minimum 1-year follow-up were included. Patients with a history of self-harm before surgery were excluded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to assess risk factors for self-harm. Statistical significance was assessed at P < 0.05. In total, 138,223 patients were included. The incidence of self-harm within 1 year was 0.40% (549 patients). In the multivariable model, younger age, male sex, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores were risk factors for self-harm. Specific comorbidities associated with increased risk for self-harm included alcohol use disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, tobacco use, and preoperative opioid use (all P < 0.001). The strongest associations between comorbidity and self-harm were seen for depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.68), anxiety (OR = 2.03), and alcohol use disorder (OR = 1.89). Self-harm is a rare, yet understudied potential complication of lumbar fusion procedures. In this national database study, the incidence of self-harm was 0.4% in the year after elective lumbar fusion. Although some risk factors for self-harm are nonmodifiable, other behavioral and mental health comorbidities may serve to flag patients as targets for early preventive intervention.

[PMID: 41187329] The prevalence and incidence of dementia are higher in migrants and those with low socioeconomic status (SES). Mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer a potentially scalable way to reduce dementia risk via risk factor modification. We co-designed the MIND-PRO app-an mHealth intervention targeting dementia risk factors through self-managed lifestyle changes and remote coaching-specifically designed for Dutch individuals with low SES and those with Turkish or South Asian Surinamese migration backgrounds. We focused on these migrant populations as they are the largest in the Netherlands and have the highest risk of developing dementia. In this qualitative study, we explored the needs and preferences of our target populations aged 50-75 years old at increased dementia risk by conducting semistructured interviews and focus groups. Participant feedback was used to iteratively refine and adapt a prototype intervention based on insights from prior mHealth trials. We interviewed 23 participants (median age 59, IQR 55-63 y; n=15, 65% female) and conducted two focus groups with 7 Turkish women and 13 Dutch participants with low SES. The target populations emphasized personalization features such as goal setting, self-tracking, educational material, and remote coaching. Participants highlighted the importance of social interaction and autonomy in achieving sustainable lifestyle changes. Tailoring coaching and lifestyle advice to cultural practices was deemed beneficial. Optimal mHealth interventions targeting dementia risk factors in migrants and individuals with low SES should be personalized and interactive, respect autonomy, and integrate cultural needs and preferences.",3

While traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), caused by acute external forces, is well-researched, non-traumatic spinal cord injury (NTSCI), arising from chronic conditions like tumors and infections, is often underreported and misclassified. NTSCI is increasingly recognized as a major cause of SCI globally, particularly affecting the elderly and infants. Despite its prevalence, research on NTSCI remains limited, necessitating new models to understand its pathophysiology. This study introduces a novel, repeatable model for NTSCI in both neonatal (9 days post-partum) and adult rats (9 weeks post-partum), simulating chronic compression injuries. The model uses 3D-printed (PLA) spacers to induce mild-moderate compression in the lower thoracic vertebrae. Six weeks of spinal cord compression resulted in locomotor deficits and cellular changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic injury due to disrupted blood flow, without significant long-term inflammation or astrogliosis. This versatile model can be easily adapted for different age groups, for graded injury severities, and for different injury durations. It offers a promising avenue for understanding and treating chronic compression NTSCI, addressing a critical gap in current research. This model can be used in future research to test and understand the effectiveness and pathophysiology of decompression and cellular interventions in response to chronic compression NTSCI.

[PMID: 25316291] Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 is a multifunctional protein affecting many cellular processes and has been described to bind microtubules. Defective microtubule-based axonal transport is hypothesized to contribute to Parkinson's disease, but whether LRRK2 mutations affect this process to mediate pathogenesis is not known. Here we find that LRRK2 containing pathogenic Roc-COR domain mutations (R1441C, Y1699C) preferentially associates with deacetylated microtubules, and inhibits axonal transport in primary neurons and in Drosophila, causing locomotor deficits in vivo. In vitro, increasing microtubule acetylation using deacetylase inhibitors or the tubulin acetylase αTAT1 prevents association of mutant LRRK2 with microtubules, and the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) restores axonal transport. In vivo knockdown of the deacetylases HDAC6 and Sirt2, or administration of TSA rescues both axonal transport and locomotor behavior. Thus, this study reveals a pathogenic mechanism and a potential intervention for Parkinson's disease.",2

However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNcDA neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNcDA neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41186436] The orbitofrontal cortex is central to decision making, reward valuation, emotional regulation, and goal-directed behavior. Although traditional cytoarchitectonic classifications, such as Brodmann map, identified multiple cortical areas within the orbitofrontal cortex, recent neuroimaging advancements such as the Human Connectome Project have refined our anatomical understanding in granular detail. This study characterizes the structural and functional connectivity of key orbitofrontal subregions, particularly Brodmann area 11, Brodmann area 13, Brodmann area 14, and Brodmann area 47, corresponding to Human Connectome Project areas 11L, 13L, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)/polar orbitofrontal cortex, and 47m/47 s/a47r, respectively. Structural connectivity analyses reveal significant large white matter connections with the inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and pathways linking the OFC to the amygdala and temporal cortex. Functionally, 11L is involved in valuation and decision making, 13L contributes to emotion regulation, OFC/polar orbitofrontal cortex plays a key role in reward processing and self-referential cognition, and areas 47 m, 47 s, and a47r have a role in coordinating cognitive and emotional information, as well as language production and semantic processing. These subregions integrate sensory-affective information and support theory of mind and semantic processing. Disruptions in OFC connectivity contribute to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, inducing various symptoms of addiction, obesity, depression, Parkinson disease, and frontotemporal dementia, highlighting the relevance of our improved anatomical understanding of this region for targeted neuromodulation strategies. Importantly, this work leverages an anatomically precise nomenclature from the Human Connectome Project to refine our understanding of the OFC's connectivity, enabling more precise neuromodulatory targeting while improving the reproducibility and sharing of research findings of this region.

[PMID: 41186289] While various psychological factors increase Parkinson's disease (PD) risk, delirium's role remains unexplored. This study examined whether delirium is associated with PD incidence and identified potential modifying factors. We conducted a matched cohort study using UK Biobank data, including 6,254 patients with first-time delirium and 31,270 matched unexposed individuals. Cox proportional hazards models assessed PD risk following delirium, evaluating effect modification by age, sex, education, BMI, depression, frailty, and polygenic risk scores. During follow-up (median: 1,011 days for exposed vs 1,678 days for unexposed), 2% of delirium patients developed PD vs 1% of controls. Delirium was associated with significantly increased PD risk (HR: 3.97; 95% CI: 2.97-5.33). Education level significantly modified this association, with higher education linked to greater risk (College: HR 6.57; Non-college: HR 3.70). Age, sex, BMI, frailty, and polygenic risk scores did not significantly alter the association. Delirium is a significant and potentially modifiable risk factor for PD, highlighting the clinical importance of its prevention and management, particularly in highly educated individuals.",3

We hypothesized a difference exists in the transcriptional response of keloid fibroblasts to mechanical strain compared with normal fibroblasts. Normal and keloid fibroblasts were seeded in a device calibrated to deliver a known level of equibiaxial strain. We examined the transcriptional response of TGF-beta isoforms and collagen Ialpha, genes differentially expressed in keloids. Keloid fibroblasts produced more mRNA for TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and collagen Ialpha after mechanical strain compared to normals, and this was correlated with protein production. Inhibiting the major mechanical signal transduction pathway with the ERK inhibitor, U0126, blocked upregulation of gene expression. In addition, keloid fibroblasts formed more focal adhesion complexes as measured by immunofluorescence for focal adhesion kinase, integrin beta1, and vinculin. Finally, there is increased activation of focal adhesion kinase when we detected the phosphorylated form of focal adhesion kinase with immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. In summary, keloid fibroblasts have an exaggerated response to mechanical strain compared to normal fibroblasts leading to increased production of pro-fibrotic growth factors. This may be one molecular mechanism for the development of keloids.

[PMID: 11468280] Fibroblasts are subjected to changes of the mechanical force balance during physiological as well as pathological situations, such as wound healing, development of hypertrophic scars, and fibrogenesis. However, the molecular response and the changes in fibroblast gene expression upon mechanical stimulation remain poorly understood. As an in vitro model, human dermal fibroblasts were cultured within a three-dimensional network of fibrillar collagen either under high (stressed) or low tension (relaxed). cDNA microarray technology in combination with Northern blot analysis led to identification of mechano-responsive genes coding for extracellular matrix proteins, fibrogenic growth factors, protease inhibitors, components of focal adhesions, and the cytoskeleton. Application of biaxial strain to fibroblasts cultured on flexible silicone membranes revealed that the type of strain as well as the properties of the substrate induced different patterns of gene regulation. The transcriptional profile of mechanically induced genes in collagen lattices suggests that mechanical stimuli lead to a ""synthetic"" fibroblast phenotype characterized by induction of connective tissue synthesis while simultaneously inhibiting matrix degradation.

[PMID: 41187304] Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) represents a complex interplay of pathophysiological processes that create a self-perpetuating cycle of heart and kidney dysfunction. While it is clearly understood how hemodynamic changes connect pathogenesis in the two organs, other processes are also in play. Some are the structural changes involving both the cellular and extracellular compartments that precede functional alterations. Fibrosis, which is initiated by an inflammatory response triggering myofibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix production, is a common denominator of heart and kidney pathology in CRS. This review focuses on fibroblast activities as a crucial factor in disease onset and progression in CRS. We explore how fibrosis in one organ can trigger or worsen dysfunction in the other organ, and we describe the key pathological signaling pathways of cardiorenal fibrosis, the extracellular matrix-derived biomarkers that can aid clinical management and drug development, and the therapeutic opportunities that can be beneficial in CRS by targeting fibroblast activities.",3

Its etiology remains unknown, although inflammatory pathways appear to be important. Given the dynamic environment of the lung, we examined the significance of mechanotransduction on both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling during IPF. <b>Innovation:</b> Mechanotransduction pathways have not been thoroughly examined in the context of lung disease, and pharmacologic approaches for IPF do not currently target these pathways. The interplay between mechanical strain and inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis remains incompletely understood. <b>Approach:</b> In this study, we used conditional KO mice to block mechanotransduction by knocking out Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) expression in fibroblasts, followed by induction of pulmonary fibrosis using bleomycin. We examined both normal human and human IPF fibroblasts and used immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western Blot to evaluate the effects of FAK inhibitor (FAK-I) on modulating fibrotic and inflammatory genes. <b>Results:</b> Our data indicate that the deletion of FAK in mice reduces expression of fibrotic and inflammatory genes in lungs. Similarly, mechanical straining in normal human lung fibroblasts activates inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. The FAK inhibition decreases these signals but has a less effect on IPF fibroblasts as compared with normal human fibroblasts. <b>Conclusion:</b> Administering FAK-I at early stages of fibrosis may attenuate the FAK-mediated fibrotic response pathway in IPF, potentially mediating disease progression.

[PMID: 21986284] Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key aspect of myocardial response to biomechanical stress and heart failure. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) regulate the ECM turnover through negative regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the ECM structural proteins. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 is unique among TIMPs in activating pro-MMP2 in addition to inhibiting a number of MMPs. Given this dual role of TIMP2, we investigated whether TIMP2 serves a critical role in heart disease. Pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in 8-week-old male mice resulted in greater left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, dilation, and dysfunction in TIMP2-deficient (TIMP2(-/-)) compared with wild-type mice at 2 weeks and 5 weeks post-TAC. Despite lack of MMP2 activation, total collagenase activity and specific membrane type MMP activity were greater in TIMP2(-/-)-TAC hearts. Loss of TIMP2 resulted in a marked reduction of integrin β1D levels and compromised focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, resulting in impaired adhesion of cardiomyocytes to ECM proteins, laminin, and fibronectin. Nonuniform ECM remodeling in TIMP2(-/-)-TAC hearts revealed degraded network structure as well as excess fibrillar deposition. Greater fibrosis in TIMP2(-/-)-TAC compared with wild-type TAC hearts was due to higher levels of SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) and posttranslational stabilization of collagen fibers rather than increased collagen synthesis. Inhibition of MMPs including membrane type MMP significantly reduced left ventricular dilation and dysfunction, hypertrophy, and fibrosis in TIMP2(-/-)-TAC mice. Lack of TIMP2 leads to exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and remodeling after pressure overload because of excess activity of membrane type MMP and loss of integrin β1D, leading to nonuniform ECM remodeling and impaired myocyte-ECM interaction.

The question of which tea possesses the most potent anti-aging properties and the underlying mechanisms of these effects remains largely obscure. To explore which type of tea has the strongest anti-aging activity and its mechanism of action. The Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) longevity and stress tests were used to evaluate the anti-aging activities of six types of tea. Additionally, ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was employed to compare the differences in anti-aging-related chemical components among these teas. These analyses were conducted to identify the tea with the strongest anti-aging activity and to further explore its underlying molecular mechanisms. All the extracts of tea (200 μg/mL) prolonged life and enhanced stress resistance. Surprisingly, dark tea (DT) had significant anti-aging efficacy. Furthermore, this study found that anti-aging mechanisms of DT include (a) DT modulated the IGF-1 signaling pathway (IIS), SKN-1 and HSF-1 stress resistance pathway, and the AMPK/SIRT1/FOXO signaling pathway. (b) DT upregulated skn-1 and ftn-1 expression, decreased Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels, and inhibited ferroptosis. (c) DT preserved the integrity and functionality of mitochondria. This study demonstrated that DT significantly extended lifespan by enhancing antioxidant capacity, maintaining mitochondrial function and suppressing ferroptosis in C. elegans. These anti-aging effects mediated by multiple mechanisms. Furthermore, the anti-aging properties of DT are partly attributed to its high flavonoid levels.

[PMID: 41186777] Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis involves apoptosis, inflammation, lipogenesis, and insulin resistance. Hepatocyte apoptosis leads to liver injury and fibrosis, while inflammation exacerbates damage through immune cells and cytokines. Lipogenesis promotes fat accumulation and lipotoxicity, stressing hepatocytes, whereas insulin resistance impairs glucose metabolism and exacerbates dysfunction. Highlight the complexity of NASH and the need for multi-targeted therapies are highlighted by these interrelated processes. Using in silico transcriptomic analysis, this study identifies key microRNAs (miRNAs) in NASH and explores the relationship between miRNAs and circ-MYO9B in NASH. To find differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), miRNA expression profiles from the liver and blood datasets (GSE33857, GSE59492, and GSE49012) were examined. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced cirrhosis (NASH-CH)-related miRNA modules were discovered by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). RT-qPCR was used on tissue and blood samples to examine the expression and interaction of circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p in NASH patients, and dual-luciferase assays confirmed their direct interaction. Circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p were found to be significantly correlated in both blood and liver tissue in NASH-CH patients, according to expression analysis. RT-qPCR analysis validated their dysregulation, suggesting their role in the advancement of the disease. The direct interaction between circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p was confirmed by the dual-luciferase assay, indicating a regulatory function in metabolic pathways. By modulating this miRNA, circ-MYO9B may influence downstream pathways in which miR-193b-5p is known to be involved, such as lipogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that circ-MYO9B may represent a potential therapeutic target for addressing metabolic dysfunction associated with NASH, although further validation in hepatocyte-specific models is warranted.

[PMID: 41184229] Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) metabolism is independently regulated in different compartments in endothelial cells (EC). The metabolic profile and functional impact of NADPH during EC senescence remain largely unknown. Using a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator, we find that cytosolic, but not mitochondrial, NADPH level increases during EC senescence. Upregulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) further elevates cytosolic NADPH level during EC senescence. Suppression of G6PD S-nitrosylation at C385 potentiates G6PD activity. G6PD overexpression alleviates, while its knockdown aggravates, vascular aging. NADPH is indispensable for G6PD to protect against vascular aging through increasing reduced glutathione and inhibiting HDAC3 activity. Among 1419 FDA-approved drugs, folic acid, catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase to generate NADPH, effectively alleviates vascular aging in angiotensin II-infused mice and naturally aged mice. The connection between NADPH metabolism and EC senescence provides a unique angle for understanding vascular aging and an efficient target for therapy.",3

This study addresses challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of multimorbid patients with CRSwNP and asthma providing new insights for their management. Using a modified Delphi method, a scientific board of 40 Italian clinicians (pulmonologists, allergists/clinical immunologists, and ear, nose, and throat specialists) developed consensus statements regarding the multimorbid patient with severe CRSwNP and asthma and including the disease burden, assessment, treatment and multidisciplinary management of multimorbid patients. All statements reached consensus. Experts acknowledged the substantial disease burden, the key pathophysiological role of type 2 inflammation in multimorbid patients and the need for multidisciplinary care. The use of biologics represents a highly effective therapeutic opportunity for patients with comorbidities, optimising overall outcomes. Integrated care pathways and regular multidisciplinary re-assessment were deemed essential for treatment decisions and improved care in multimorbid patients. This consensus highlights the value of a multidisciplinary approach for multimorbid CRSwNP and asthma patients, advocating for endotype-driven therapies and standardised pathways in clinical practice.

[PMID: 41170702] Bronchiectasis is a chronic, complex, and heterogeneous respiratory disease characterized by irreversible bronchial dilation, persistent airway inflammation, and recurrent infections. Traditionally viewed from a lung-centered perspective, its pathophysiology has been explained by the ""vicious cycle"" hypothesis, later refined into the more dynamic concept of the ""vicious vortex."" However, emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of comorbidities in influencing disease progression, symptom burden, and prognosis. This review explores the evolving understanding of bronchiectasis by integrating comorbidities into current pathophysiological frameworks. We illustrate how coexisting conditions interact with components of the vicious vortex, amplifying airway inflammation, impairing host defenses, and disrupting clearance mechanisms. We summarize evidence on the prevalence, clinical impact, and prognostic significance of key comorbidities and discuss their implications for patient management. Finally, we emphasize the importance of an integrated, multidisciplinary approach and the emerging role of the treatable traits framework, which focuses on identifying clinically relevant, biologically measurable, and modifiable traits-regardless of whether they are etiological or nonetiological. In this sense, we propose a conceptual ""Copernican Revolution"" in bronchiectasis care: recognizing comorbidities not as secondary features, but as potential drivers of disease trajectory. By adopting this pragmatic strategy, clinicians can optimize quality of life, achieve patient-centered care, and improve outcomes in this condition.

[PMID: 41069972] Multimorbidity, the coexistence of two or more chronic non-communicable diseases, poses a significant health challenge in India, particularly among older adults. Factors such as population ageing, lifestyle changes and urbanisation have led to an increasing burden of chronic diseases. Data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health Wave 2, which surveyed 11 818 individuals in India, were utilised, focusing on those aged 50 and above. The analysis included 7118 participants after excluding those with missing or incorrect data. The prevalence and patterns of multimorbidity were assessed by examining the co-occurrence of eight chronic conditions: arthritis, stroke, angina, diabetes, chronic lung disease, asthma, depression and hypertension. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA software to determine the frequency and chronicity of these conditions. The prevalence of multimorbidity was 45.14%, with hypertension (22%) and arthritis (19%) being the most common conditions. Hypertension also showed the highest chronicity, often being the first diagnosed condition. Significant patterns of dyads and triads were identified, with hypertension frequently co-occurring with other chronic conditions. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of multimorbidity among older adults in India, revealing a high prevalence of conditions like hypertension and arthritis. The findings highlight the substantial burden of multimorbidity, with significant implications for healthcare management. The study underscores the need for integrated, patient-centred care models to manage multimorbidity effectively. These insights are crucial for developing targeted interventions and health policies aimed at improving care coordination and outcomes for individuals with multiple chronic conditions in India.",3

[PMID: 22189873] Jumonji C-terminal (JmjC) domain-containing proteins are protein hydroxylases and histone demethylases that control gene expression. Jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (Jmjd6) is indispensable for embryonic development and has both histone arginine demethylase and lysyl-hydroxylase activities. The protein undergoes post-translational homo-oligomerization, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we examined the enzymatic activity of Jmjd6 and uncovered the mechanism underlying its homo-oligomerization. An in vitro enzymatic assay monitored by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry indicates that Jmjd6 is unable to remove the methyl group from histone arginine residues but can hydroxylate the histone H4 tail at lysine residues in a 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)- and Fe (II)-dependent manner. A mutational analysis reveals that the homo-oligomerization of Jmjd6 requires its enzymatic activity and the N- and C-termini. Using an in vitro enzymatic assay, we further demonstrate that Jmjd6 can hydroxylate its N-terminus but not its C-terminus. In summary, we did not detect arginine demethylase activity for Jmjd6, but we did confirm that it could catalyze the lysyl-hydroxylation of histone peptides. In addition, we demonstrated that the homo-oligomerization of Jmjd6 requires its own enzymatic activity and the N- and C-termini. We propose that Jmjd6 forms intermolecular covalent bonds between its N- and C-termini via autohydroxylation.

Additionally, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from GSE26296 was utilized to analyze differentially expressed genes in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) of emphysema patients. The RNA-seq data from GSE38974 underwent weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) along with differential analysis to pinpoint genes that are differentially expressed and modules linked to COPD. Validation was performed using a mouse model of emphysema induced by cigarette smoke (CS) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) exposed to 3% cigarette smoke extract (CSE). The genes that showed differential expression in cDCs and mDCs were mainly associated with immune responses, the reaction to interferon-gamma, the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells, along with the signaling pathways of TNF and IL-17. The WGCNA results revealed that the green-yellow and red modules exhibited the highest correlation coefficients with the COPD phenotype. An assessment of the genes that are expressed differently between cDCs and mDCs, combined with the intersection of GSE38974 module genes and differentially expressed genes, results in the identification of four dendritic cells (DCs)-related genes: one upregulated signature gene (RASGRP3) and three downregulated signature genes (C1QB, BLOC1S2, VSIG4). In both the lung tissues of mice with CS-induced emphysema and in CSE-treated BMDCs, RT-qPCR validated the expression trends of these four genes. Concomitantly, Western blot revealed a reduction in VSIG4 protein level in the lung tissues of emphysema mice compared with the control group. RASGRP3, C1QB, BLOC1S2, and VSIG4 may represent DCs-related genes in the lung tissue of COPD patients, potentially involved in the development and progression of emphysema.

[PMID: 41185886] The activation of dendritic cells, which is atypical, is vital for triggering the acquired immune response in people afflicted with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Lack of FGF21 in mice increases life expectancy.,FGF21 AND mice AND lifespan AND longevity,"38943639,38653921,39972172","[PMID: 38943639] Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. A model cell system is constructed to induce ferroptosis by re-expressing the transcription factor BACH1, a potent ferroptosis inducer, in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs). The transfer of the culture supernatant from ferroptotic iMEFs activates the proliferation of hepatoma cells and other fibroblasts and suppresses cellular senescence-like features. The BACH1-dependent secretion of the longevity factor FGF21 is increased in ferroptotic iMEFs. The anti-senescent effects of the culture supernatant from these iMEFs are abrogated by Fgf21 knockout. BACH1 activates the transcription of Fgf21 by promoting ferroptotic stress and increases FGF21 protein expression by suppressing its autophagic degradation through transcriptional Sqstm1 and Lamp2 repression. The BACH1-induced ferroptotic FGF21 secretion suppresses obesity in high-fat diet-fed mice and the short lifespan of progeria mice. The inhibition of these aging-related phenotypes can be physiologically significant regarding ferroptosis.

[PMID: 38653921] Aging is a physiological condition accomplished with persistent low-grade inflammation and metabolic disorders. FGF21 has been reported to act as a potent longevity determinant, involving inflammatory response and energy metabolism. In this study, we engineered aging FGF21 knockout mice of 36-40 weeks and observed that FGF21 deficiency manifests a spontaneous inflammatory response of lung and abnormal accumulation of lipids in liver. On one hand, inflamed state in lungs and increased circulating inflammatory cytokines were found in FGF21 knockout mice of 36-40 weeks. To evaluate the ability of FGF21 to suppress inflammation, a subsequent study found that FGF21 knockout aggravated LPS-induced pulmonary exudation and inflammatory infiltration in mice, while exogenous administration of FGF21 reversed these malignant phenotypes by enhancing microvascular endothelial junction. On the other hand, FGF21 knockout induces fatty liver in aging mice, characterized by excessive accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. Further quantitative metabolomics and lipidomics analysis revealed perturbed metabolic profile in liver lacking FGF21, including disrupted glucose and lipids metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Taken together, this investigation reveals the protective role of FGF21 during aging by weakening the inflammatory response and balancing energy metabolism.

[PMID: 39972172] Age-related thymic involution precedes aging of all other organs in vertebrates and initiates the process of declining T cell diversity, which leads to eventual immune dysfunction. Whether FGF21, a liver-derived pro-longevity hormone that is also produced in thymic stroma, including by adipocytes, controls the mechanism of thymic demise is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that elevation of FGF21 in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and in adipocytes protects against thymic aging, whereas conditional hepatic overexpression did not impact thymic biology in aged mice. Notably, elevation of thymic FGF21 increased naïve CD8 T cells in aged animals and extended healthspan. Mechanistically, thymic FGF21 overexpression elevated TECs and reduced fibroadipogenic cells. Ablation of β-klotho, the obligatory co-receptor for FGF21 in Foxn1<sup>+</sup> TECs, accelerated thymic aging, suggesting regulation of TECs by FGF21 is partially required for thymic lymphopoiesis. These findings establish that paracrine FGF21 improves thymic function and delays immune aging.",3
Lack of FGF21 in mice slows the rate of atherosclerotic plaque formation.,FGF21 AND mice AND atherosclerosis AND plaque formation,"26912152,32957703,31570705","[PMID: 26912152] Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Besides its antiobese and antidiabetic activity, FGF21 also possesses the protective effects against atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of FGF21 are elevated in patients with atherosclerosis, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, possibly due to a compensatory upregulation. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, formation of atherosclerotic plaques is exacerbated by genetic depletion of FGF21, but is attenuated upon replenishment with recombinant FGF21. However, the blood vessel is not the direct target of FGF21, and the antiatherosclerotic activity of FGF21 is attributed to its actions in adipose tissues and liver. In adipocytes, FGF21 promotes secretion of adiponectin, which in turn acts directly on blood vessels to reduce endothelial dysfunction, inhibit proliferation of smooth muscle cells and block conversion of macrophages to foam cells. Furthermore, FGF21 suppresses cholesterol biosynthesis and attenuates hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 in hepatocytes. The effects of FGF21 on elevation of adiponectin and reduction of hypercholesterolemia are also observed in a phase-1b clinical trial in patients with obesity and diabetes. Therefore, FGF21 exerts its protection against atherosclerosis by fine-tuning the interorgan crosstalk between liver, brain, adipose tissue, and blood vessels.

[PMID: 32957703] Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormonal regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism. We aimed to investigate the effect of an FGF21 analogue (LY2405319) on the development of atherosclerosis and its associated parameters. ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 14 weeks and were randomly assigned to control (saline) or FGF21 (0.1 mg/kg) treatment group (<i>n</i> = 10/group) for 5 weeks. Plaque size in the aortic arch/valve areas and cardiovascular risk markers were evaluated in blood and tissues. The effects of FGF21 on various atherogenesis-related pathways were also assessed. Atherosclerotic plaque areas in the aortic arch/valve were significantly smaller in the FGF21 group than in controls after treatment. FGF21 significantly decreased body weight and glucose concentrations, and increased circulating adiponectin levels. FGF21 treatment alleviated insulin resistance and decreased circulating concentrations of triglycerides, which were significantly correlated with plaque size. FGF21 treatment reduced lipid droplets in the liver and decreased fat cell size and inflammatory cell infiltration in the abdominal visceral fat compared with the control group. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels were decreased and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were increased by FGF21 treatment. Uncoupling protein 1 expression in subcutaneous fat was greater and fat cell size in brown fat was smaller in the FGF21 group compared with controls. Administration of FGF21 showed anti-atherosclerotic effects in atherosclerosis-prone mice and exerted beneficial effects on critical atherosclerosis pathways. Improvements in inflammation and insulin resistance seem to be mechanisms involved in the mitigation of atherosclerosis by FGF21 therapy.

[PMID: 31570705] Dyslipidemia-induced atherosclerosis, which has a risk of high morbidity and mortality, can be alleviated by metabolic activation associated with mitochondrial function. The effect of dichloroacetate (DCA), a general pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, on in vivo energy expenditure in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a western diet (WD) has not yet been investigated. WD-fed ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice developed atherosclerotic plaques and hyperlipidemia along with obesity, which were significantly ameliorated by DCA administration. Increased oxygen consumption was associated with heat production in the DCA-treated group, with no change in food intake or physical activity compared with those of the control. These processes were correlated with the increased gene expression of Dio2 and Ucp-1, which represents brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation, in both WD-induced atherosclerosis and high-fat-induced obesity models. In addition, we found that DCA stimulated hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) mRNA expression, which might be important for lowering lipid levels and insulin sensitization via BAT activation, in a dose- and time-dependent manner associated with serum FGF21 levels. Interestingly, Fgf21 mRNA expression was mediated in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner within several minutes after DCA treatment independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Taken together, the results suggest that enhanced glucose oxidation by DCA protects against atherosclerosis by inducing hepatic FGF21 expression and BAT activation, resulting in augmented energy expenditure for heat generation.",3
MafA phosphorylation decreases its ubiquitination.,MafA phosphorylation AND MafA ubiquitination AND phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination AND post-translational modification,"41186629,41186214,41184251","[PMID: 41186629] Costunolide (COS) is a bioactive sesquiterpene lactone compound extracted from Aucklandia lappa, known for its anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, aligning with the traditional Chinese medicine theory of ""clearing heat and dispersing nodules"" in the treatment of breast ailments. Network pharmacology identified EGFR as the core target of COS, with enrichment analysis revealing the EGFR/ERK/AKT axis as a key pathway. Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinity of COS to the EGFR kinase domain, relying on hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. In vitro experiments showed that COS inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, COS increased EGFR ubiquitination, leading to a decrease in EGFR protein levels, thereby inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation and the activation of downstream ERK and Akt signaling pathways. EGF could partially reverse the growth inhibitory effects of COS, confirming the critical role of EGFR. This study elucidates that COS exerts its anti-TNBC effects by inducing EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, thereby inhibiting the ERK/AKT signaling pathway. This finding integrates traditional Chinese medicine theory with modern molecular oncology mechanisms, providing a reference for the development of plant-derived multi-target anticancer drugs.

[PMID: 41186214] Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an uncurable hematologic cancer due to neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells. The role and detailed mechanisms of Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 4 (USP4) in MM remain to be clarified. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK-8 and TUNEL. Molecular expression was determined by RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The morphology of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was observed by ER tracker-red. The protein interaction and ubiquitination level were evaluated by Co-IP. The binding of myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) to the USP4 promoter was confirmed by ChIP and dual luciferase reporter assay. The in vivo growth of MM was monitored by subcutaneous xenograft experiments. USP4 knockdown suppressed MM cell proliferation and triggered ER stress and apoptosis, whereas USP4 overexpression resulted in the opposite effect. Mechanistically, USP4 enhanced nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) protein stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination. MEF2A bound to the USP4 promoter to activate its transcription and expression. The promotive effect of sh-USP4 or sh-MEF2A on ER stress and apoptosis of MM cells was counteracted by NR4A1 or USP4 overexpression. MEF2A deficiency restrained in vivo MM growth by activating ER stress and apoptosis through modulation of the USP4/NR4A1 pathway. MEF2A activates USP4 to repress ER stress and apoptosis of MM cells via deubiquitination of NR4A1, thus favoring MM progression. Our findings identify USP4 as an attractive intervention target for MM therapy.

[PMID: 41184251] As a key tumor suppressor, KDM6A plays critical roles in maintaining epigenetic homeostasis and suppressing tumorigenesis. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling KDM6A activity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are not well defined. In this study, we employed tissue microarray analysis of clinical specimens to identify Ser829 as a predominant phosphorylation site of KDM6A in HNSCC and other solid tumors. Using mass spectrometry and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that CDK1-mediated phosphorylation at Ser829 enhances KDM6A binding to SFN, leading to its nuclear export and functional inactivation. Integrated chromatin profiling and metabolic analyses revealed that phosphorylated KDM6A-pSer829 drives glycolytic reprogramming through H3K27Me3-dependent transcriptional silencing of PER2, ultimately promoting tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings establish KDM6A post-translational modification as a pivotal regulator of metabolic adaptation in HNSCC progression, providing a potential therapeutic target for combating cancer through this epigenetic-metabolic axis.",3

Here, we show that Maf-transforming activity is controlled by GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation and that phosphorylation by GSK-3 can increase the oncogenic activity of a protein. Using microarray analysis, we identify a gene-expression subprogram regulated by GSK-3-mediated Maf phosphorylation involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and relevant to cancer progression. We also demonstrate that GSK-3 triggers MafA sequential phosphorylation on residues S61, T57, T53, and S49, inducing its ubiquitination and degradation. Paradoxically, this phosphorylation increases MafA-transcriptional activity through the recruitment of the coactivator P/CAF. We further demonstrate that P/CAF protects MafA from ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that, upon the release of the coactivator complex, MafA becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded to allow the response to terminate.

Medications to treat obesity are highly effective.,obesity medications AND efficacy AND weight loss efficacy AND obesity treatment effectiveness,"41039116,41057950,41111360","[PMID: 41039116] This systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of obesity management medications (OMMs) in terms of reducing body weight and impact on obesity-related complications. Here a Medline and Embase search was performed up to 31 January 2025 for randomized controlled trials comparing OMMs versus placebo/active comparators in adults. Primary endpoint was percentage of total body weight loss (TBWL%) at the end of the study. Secondary endpoints were TBWL% at 1, 2 and ≥3 years, lipid profile, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, mental health, serious adverse events, quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, remission of obesity-related complications and all-cause mortality. Fifty-six clinical trials were identified-orlistat (22), semaglutide (14), liraglutide (11), tirzepatide (6), naltrexone/bupropion (5) and phentermine/topiramate (2)-enrolling 60,307 patients (32,598 OMM and 27,709 placebo). All OMMs showed a significantly greater TBWL% versus placebo (P < 0.0001), more than 10% for semaglutide and tirzepatide. Both tirzepatide and semaglutide showed normoglycemia restoration, remission of type 2 diabetes and reduction in hospitalization due to heart failure. Semaglutide was effective in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and reducing pain in knee osteoarthritis. Tirzepatide was effective in remission of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. These results support the need to individualize the selection of OMMs.

[PMID: 41057950] Overweight and obesity have a negative impact on health and have a detrimental effect on the operational readiness of soldiers. Different prevention and intervention measures against obesity include diet, physical activity, education, coaching or medication or a combination of several aspects have been investigated. This review systematically assesses the effectiveness of lifestyle, dietary, educational, and pharmacological interventions on weight, body composition, and military readiness in active-duty personnel. We carried out a systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search was conducted in various electronic databases from 2000 to July 2024. The search strategy combined three concepts: military population, outcome terms, interventions or programs. For the review, 21 articles met the inclusion criteria (total n = 1696). Where possible, the effect size (ES) was calculated. In studies that only examined exercise, minor effects were reported, e.g. a reduction in weight (-0.5 kg), Body Mass Index (BMI) (-0.3 kg/m²), waist circumference (-0.1 cm) and body fat percentage (-1.1%) without relevant statistical ES. Studies with nutritional programs reported low to moderate ES. Combined programs including dietary and exercise countermeasures showed to be more effective than programs based on diet or exercise alone. Combined programs with exercise and educational methods showed a moderate to large effect size (ES 0.6-1.3) for weight reduction. Pharmacological treatment for reducing fat intake resulted in a larger effect sizes for weight loss. The greatest efficacy (ES > 1.0) was observed for a combined intervention program consisting of lifestyle changing components based on individually tailored cognitive behavioral therapies, psychoeducation, exercise and nutritional interventions. Effective countermeasure for reducing body weight found in this study were combined interventions, like education on lifestyle changes, dietary habits and promotion of physical activity in military personnel, as well as by ketogenic dietary interventions combined with physical activity and followed by pharmacological intervention approaches. Combined interventions appear promising in some studies, but future evaluations may focus on combinations of physical activity and exercise with new pharmaceutical approaches like Semaglutide or Bimagrumab medication in the long term for military personnel due to probable favorable body composition adaptations and military readiness.

[PMID: 41111360] We aimed at comparing different approved strategies (obesity management medications-OMM, endoscopic bariatric procedures-EBP, and metabolic bariatric surgery-MBS) with lifestyle intervention/placebo/no therapy (LSI/Pbo/NT) for the treatment of different BMI-based classes of obesity (i.e., overweight-BMI: 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; class I-BMI: 30-34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; class II-BMI: 35-39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; class III-BMI >39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). This systematic review (SR) and network meta-analysis (NMA) included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing OMM, EBP, and MBS versus either LSI/Pbo/NT or active comparators in individuals with overweight or obesity. A Medline and Embase search was performed up to 31st January 2025 for RCTs on EMA (European Medicines Agency)-approved weight-loss interventions in adults with overweight/obesity. The primary endpoint was total body weight loss (TBWL%), analysed at different time points: 26-52, 53-104, 105-156, and ≥156 weeks. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, quality of life, and serious adverse events (SAE). Weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (WMD, 95% CI) for continuous variables and Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (MH-OR, 95% CI) for categorical variables were calculated using random effect models. The study was registered on the PROSPERO website (CRD42024625338). In trials enroling subjects in class I of obesity, tirzepatide resulted in equal effectiveness to both OAGB and RYGB, and it was significantly superior to all the other comparisons. In trials on class II of obesity, tirzepatide was significantly superior to all the other comparisons and inferior to both OAGB and RYGB. Semaglutide was associated with a higher TBWL% than the other OMMs (with the notable exception of tirzepatide), and it was equally effective to EBP, GCP, and LAGB. In trials enroling patients with a mean BMI >40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the procedure with the highest estimated weight loss was BPD. Semaglutide was statistically less effective than SG and gastric bypass, but not inferior to GCP and LAGB. Both RYGB and OAGB were superior to SG. In patients affected by mild to moderate obesity, newer OMMs (i.e., tirzepatide and semaglutide) appear to be valid alternatives to EBP and MBS. They could be preliminarily chosen as a first-line option based on similar efficacy and greater safety and tolerability. Higher degrees of obesity could be more effectively treated with MBS, the efficacy of which, with the notable exception of LAGB and GCP, appears superior to other treatments, especially in the long term.",3

A hollow-structured h-CdS coupled with TiO<sub>2</sub> formed a highly efficient heterojunction that enhanced light absorption, light scattering, and charge separation, resulting in significantly improved photoelectric conversion efficiency. A single-atom Fe-MNC nanozyme possessing both peroxidase- and oxidase-like activities was synthesized via a cascade anchoring strategy, successfully catalyzing a biocatalytic precipitation (BCP) reaction for signal amplification. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validated the energy band structure of the heterojunction and the catalytic superiority of Fe-MNC. Additionally, a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) was rationally designed based on the AFB1 aptamer to achieve target-specific recognition and probe amplification. By integrating these three synergistic elements, the constructed nanozyme-based PEC aptasensor enabled highly sensitive detection of AFB1 with a detection limit of 2.04 fg/mL and a linear range from 0.005 to 100 pg/mL. The sensor demonstrated excellent stability and selectivity and showed good agreement with HPLC results when applied to real sample analysis, highlighting its practical potential for food safety monitoring.

[PMID: 41187314] A global aging population seeking resolution of pain and functional decline from degenerative spine conditions is leading to an increasing number of spine surgeries. The recovery process is complex with many cognitive and physical actions performed by the patient, which can be conceptualized as patient work. Shaped by the dynamic patient work system (PWS), patient work is the time and effort patients complete at home and across health settings to meet their health goals. Our aim was to define factors in the PWS that influence the patient work of older adults' recovery during the hospital and posthospitalization phases as well as by discharge location after spine surgery.METHODS: Secondary data analysis (28 interviews) using deductive and inductive qualitative content analysis methods was used to describe PWS influencing factors. The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety 2.0 human factors framework (person, organization, task, tools and technology, and internal and external environments) guided independent (3 members) coding, codebook evolution, and team deductive analysis. Care phase and discharge location were further analyzed using team inductive analysis.RESULTS: In nearly all components, factor differences were present between discharge to home or skilled nursing facility or inpatient rehabilitation. These differences included pain severity, mobility, unexpected experiences, education not meeting their needs, the level of problem-solving required, and types of benchmarks to their goal of recovery.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that regardless of discharge disposition, older adults experience uncertainty and different needs during recovery that often generate invisible work in navigating the recovery process. Participants describe significant work to clarify any uncertainty and meet their recovery needs. Nursing has a pivotal role to further investigate strategies to help patients achieve their recovery goals.

[PMID: 41187263] Diagnostics, treatment, and research of persisting postconcussion symptoms are challenging. Assessing symptoms is essential, but currently implemented methods only allow for retrospective reporting of symptoms. A mobile health (mHealth) symptom mapping app for adults with persisting postconcussion symptoms may be an accessible and cost-efficient alternative. This study aimed to develop a research-based mobile app for symptom mapping for adults with persisting postconcussion symptoms and investigate its usability, feasibility, and safety. This was a mixed method development and usability study consisting of three iterative cycles, each including (1) app design and programming, (2) app usability evaluation by the user group, and (3) app review by the clinician group. The outcomes were the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire and Mobile App Rating Scale scores, the number of days with logged symptom data during a home-testing period, and descriptions of adverse events throughout the study period. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore the user group's experiences further. Twenty-three adults with persisting postconcussion symptoms (median age 52, IQR 34-59 years; 70% female) were included in the user group. Six clinicians (median age 53, IQR 35-60 years), including 3 (50%) females, with a mean of 13 (SD 7) years of experience working with individuals with persisting postconcussion symptoms, were included in the clinician group. The app received a mean score of 5 (SD 1.1) on the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (7-point Likert scale) from the user group and 4.1 (SD 0.4) on the Mobile App Rating Scale (5-point Likert Scale) from the clinician group. During the 28-day home-testing period, the adherence rate among the participants in the user group was 89% (IQR 78-96), and two adverse events related to increased symptom awareness were registered. Three themes were created through reflexive thematic analysis of the qualitative data: (1) Visualizing the invisible-Enabling reflection and insight; (2) Personalized yet simple-Balancing relevance and usefulness; and (3) More than just a number-The complexity behind the symptom scores. We developed a research-based symptom mapping app for people with persisting postconcussion symptoms. The app received high usability ratings from both the user and clinician groups. The app is a feasible alternative to traditional symptom mapping methods, and it is safe to use for its intended purpose.",3
Men are more susceptible to death due to pneumonia when compared to women.,pneumonia mortality AND gender differences AND sex differences AND men vs women,39449074,"[PMID: 39449074] Male sex has been identified as a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcomes. This sex difference has been mostly attributed to the complex role of sex hormones. Cell surface entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which is under transcriptional regulation by androgens. P450 aromatase enzyme converts androgens to estrogens. This study measured concentrations of aromatase enzyme, testosterone, estradiol, and TMPRSS-2 in plasma of hospitalized COVID-19 patients to elucidate the dynamics of sex-linked disparity in COVID-19 and correlate them with disease severity and mortality. In this prospective cohort study, a total of 265 patients (41% women), age 18 years and older, who had a positive COVID-19 PCR test and were hospitalized for COVID-19 at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, (between May 2020 and May 2021) were enrolled in the study if met inclusion criteria. Plasma concentrations of Testosterone, aromatase, TMPRSS-2, and estradiol were measured by ELISA. COVID-19 patients were dichotomized based on disease severity into moderate-severe (n = 146) or critical (n = 119). Mann Whitney U and logistic regression were used to correlate the analytes with disease severity and mortality. TMPRSS2 (2.5 ± 0.31 vs. 1.73 ± 0.21 ng/mL, p < 0.01) and testosterone (1.2 ± 0.1 vs. 0.44 ± 0.12 ng/mL, p < 0.01) were significantly higher in men as compared to women with COVID-19 after adjusting for age in a multivariate model. There was no sex difference seen in the level of estradiol and aromatase in COVID-19 patients. TMPRSS2 and aromatase were higher, while testosterone was lower in patients with increased COVID-19 severity. They were independently associated with COVID-19 severity, after adjusting for several baseline risk factors in a multivariate logistic regression model. In terms of mortality, TMPRRS2 and aromatase levels were significantly higher in non-survivors. Our study demonstrates that testosterone, aromatase, and TMPRSS2 are markers of COVID-19 severity. Estradiol levels do not change with disease severity in COVID-19. In terms of mortality prediction, higher aromatase and TMPRSS-2 levels can be used to predict mortality from COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. COVID-19 has caused over a million deaths in the U.S., with men often getting sicker than women. Testosterone, a male hormone, helps control a protein called TMPRSS-2, which allows the COVID-19 virus to spread more easily in the body. A protein called aromatase converts the male hormone testosterone into the female hormone estrogen. It is thought that female hormone estrogen helps protect women from getting seriously ill from COVID-19. To understand the role of these hormones in COVID-19 and sex differences, we measured levels of testosterone, estrogen, aromatase (which turns testosterone into estrogen), and TMPRSS-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We also checked how this level might reflect the severity of the disease. We found that critically ill COVID-19 patients (the ones in ICU) had higher levels of TMPRSS-2 and aromatase, and lower testosterone levels. When we used these hormone levels to predict death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, higher levels of TMPRSS-2 and aromatase were linked to a lower chance of survival.",1
Metastatic colorectal cancer treated with a single agent fluoropyrimidines resulted in similar efficacy and better quality of life when compared with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in elderly patients.,Metastatic colorectal cancer AND fluoropyrimidines AND oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy AND elderly patients,"26141683,27155924,28730771","[PMID: 26141683] The management of unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a comprehensive treatment strategy involving several lines of therapy, maintenance, salvage surgery, and treatment-free intervals. Besides chemotherapy (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan), molecular-targeted agents such as anti-angiogenic agents (bevacizumab, aflibercept, regorafenib) and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor agents (cetuximab, panitumumab) have become available. Ultimately, given the increasing cost of new active compounds, new strategy trials are needed to define the optimal use and the best sequencing of these agents. Such new clinical trials require alternative endpoints that can capture the effect of several treatment lines and be measured earlier than overall survival to help shorten the duration and reduce the size and cost of trials. STRATEGIC-1 is an international, open-label, randomized, multicenter phase III trial designed to determine an optimally personalized treatment sequence of the available treatment modalities in patients with unresectable RAS wild-type mCRC. Two standard treatment strategies are compared: first-line FOLFIRI-cetuximab, followed by oxaliplatin-based second-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab (Arm A) vs. first-line OPTIMOX-bevacizumab, followed by irinotecan-based second-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab, and by an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody with or without irinotecan as third-line treatment (Arm B). The primary endpoint is duration of disease control. A total of 500 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment strategies. The STRATEGIC-1 trial is designed to give global information on the therapeutic sequences in patients with unresectable RAS wild-type mCRC that in turn is likely to have a significant impact on the management of this patient population. The trial is open for inclusion since August 2013. STRATEGIC-1 is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01910610, 23 July, 2013. STRATEGIC-1 is registered at EudraCT-No.: 2013-001928-19, 25 April, 2013.

[PMID: 27155924] The identification of RAS status (KRAS and NRAS) has changed the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The impact of the RAS mutation on cytotoxic chemotherapy efficacy has not yet been determined. Nevertheless, several retrospective studies suggest a greater efficacy of oxaliplatin in mCRC with KRAS mutation. We analyzed retrospectively the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in 216 patients with mCRC receiving first line treatment between 2008 and 2010 according to KRAS status and chemotherapy regimen used (oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based, in association with fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab). In KRAS mutated tumors, median OS was 23.4 months with oxaliplatin-based regimen, and 23.6 months with irinotecan-based regimen, with no significant difference (HR 1.30; 95 % CI 0.81-2.09; P=0.27). In KRAS wild-type tumors, median OS was 30.3 months with oxaliplatin-based regimen, and 25.4 months with irinotecan-based regimen, with no significant difference (HR 0.81; 95 % CI 0.52-1.24; P=0.33). Similarly, KRAS mutational status had no significant effect on efficacy of oxaliplatin or irinotecan regarding PFS. In this retrospective study, KRAS mutational status does not influence the efficacy of first line cytotoxic chemotherapy in association with bevacizumab.

[PMID: 28730771] To assess prognostic/predictive value of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), transthyretin (TRT), αenolase (NNE), β2-microglobulin (β2-micro), B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. 72 histologically confirmed mCRC patients treated at Oncology Institute Cluj were included. Biomarker levels were measured through validated methods. A manual method was used for CTCs, involving hemolysis, cytospin centrifugation and immunocytochemical staining for pan-cytokeratin. Statistical endpoints were response, progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Initial chemotherapy was fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin-based in 93.1%; bevacizumab was added in 58.3% of the patients. Median PFS and OS were 16.4 and 24.4 months. Two-year OS for CR & PR vs SD vs PD were 90% vs 48% vs 12%, respectively (p<0.01). Two-year OS for chemo/ bevacizumab vs chemotherapy: 65% vs 42% (p=0.09). Baseline CEA ≥5 ng/ml had a negative prognostic impact on OS and PFS (p<0.01). High baseline CEA was predictive of improved OS when adding bevacizumab (2-year OS chemo/bevacizumab vs chemo: 60% vs 17%, p<0.01); adding bevacizumab in patients with normal CEA did not improve OS (p=0.29). Higher than cut-off values for TRT had a positive OS prognostic value (p<0.01); higher levels for NNE, β2-microglobulin and BAFF had a negative impact (p<0.01). Two-year OS for baseline <1 CTC/ml vs ≥1 CTC/ ml was 74% vs 64% respectively (p=0.15). The evaluated biomarkers could be useful prognostic factors for survival. Baseline CEA also has predictive value, suggesting that patients with low levels do not benefit from bevacizumab. A non-statistically significant correlation was observed between the number of CTCs and outcome.",3

This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1)'s on methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)-induced severe pneumonia following cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. A young mouse model of severe pneumonia was established using Staphylococcus aureus and CMV. LTBP1 overexpression was induced, and pathological changes in lung tissue were assessed through H&E staining. Serum levels of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and interleukin (IL)-1β, were measured using ELISA. Bacterial load in the lungs was quantified, and protein expression levels of LTBP1, TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad3, and p-Smad3 in lung tissue were analyzed using Western blot. The LTBP1 expression was reduced in the young mouse model of severe pneumonia induced by Staphylococcus aureus after cytomegalovirus reactivation. Overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited lung damage, reduced serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and decreased bacterial load in the lungs. Additionally, overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. LTBP1 efficiently reduces severe pneumonia by activating the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating this condition.

[PMID: 41187159] Adolescent opioid use in the United States commands attention: millions of twelve- to nineteen-year-olds are exposed to opioids each year by prescription and misuse. Recent findings show that opioids bind not only to canonical opioid receptors but also interact with receptors on immune cells within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The potential for early life opioid exposure to give rise to long-term changes in the neuroimmune system is not fully understood, particularly given the adolescent brain's high susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that adolescent opioid use potentiates physiological and behavioral responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness later in life. To achieve this, we treated adolescent (postnatal day 35-42) male and female C57/BL6 mice with saline or bi-daily escalating doses of morphine for 5 days to model opioid dependence and, in adulthood (postnatal day 60-67), administered saline or a low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) to promote an immune response. Body weight, body surface temperature, and locomotor activity were recorded up to 48 hours after LPS administration. Mice were also tested in the forced swim test 52 hours after LPS administration to assess depressive-like behavior. In contrast to our hypotheses, we found that adolescent morphine exposure had no additive effect on low-dose LPS-induced sickness measures when assessed in adulthood. These data suggest that adolescent opioid exposure may have minimal effects on future immune challenges, although further research is needed to confirm this.

[PMID: 41187107] Emerging clinical evidence suggests a link between environmental noise and the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNcDA neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNcDA neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.",3

Here, we reveal a tunneling nanotube (TNT)-mediated communication mechanism between ADSCs and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) that maintains metabolic homeostasis during pregnancy. Using gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mouse models combined with live-cell imaging, scanning electron microscope, and multi-omics approaches, we demonstrate that mitochondrial transfer from ADSCs to ATMs via TNTs sustains ATM metabolic fitness. This process is governed by the WNT5A-RhoA-ROCK1 axis and becomes impaired under metabolic stress, driving ATMs inflammatory polarization and insulin resistance. Importantly, in situ ADSC administration restores mitochondrial transfer and improves metabolic parameters in GDM mice. Collectively, our work establishes TNT-mediated organelle sharing as a fundamental mechanism of stem cell-immune interaction and demonstrates that ADSC-based therapy represents a promising strategy for GDM by reprogramming the metabolism of immune cells.

[PMID: 41186777] Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis involves apoptosis, inflammation, lipogenesis, and insulin resistance. Hepatocyte apoptosis leads to liver injury and fibrosis, while inflammation exacerbates damage through immune cells and cytokines. Lipogenesis promotes fat accumulation and lipotoxicity, stressing hepatocytes, whereas insulin resistance impairs glucose metabolism and exacerbates dysfunction. Highlight the complexity of NASH and the need for multi-targeted therapies are highlighted by these interrelated processes. Using in silico transcriptomic analysis, this study identifies key microRNAs (miRNAs) in NASH and explores the relationship between miRNAs and circ-MYO9B in NASH. To find differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), miRNA expression profiles from the liver and blood datasets (GSE33857, GSE59492, and GSE49012) were examined. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced cirrhosis (NASH-CH)-related miRNA modules were discovered by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). RT-qPCR was used on tissue and blood samples to examine the expression and interaction of circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p in NASH patients, and dual-luciferase assays confirmed their direct interaction. Circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p were found to be significantly correlated in both blood and liver tissue in NASH-CH patients, according to expression analysis. RT-qPCR analysis validated their dysregulation, suggesting their role in the advancement of the disease. The direct interaction between circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p was confirmed by the dual-luciferase assay, indicating a regulatory function in metabolic pathways. By modulating this miRNA, circ-MYO9B may influence downstream pathways in which miR-193b-5p is known to be involved, such as lipogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that circ-MYO9B may represent a potential therapeutic target for addressing metabolic dysfunction associated with NASH, although further validation in hepatocyte-specific models is warranted.

[PMID: 41186653] Hypertension, a major cardiovascular risk, is affected by body composition and metabolism. We assessed the associations of body composition with hypertension and the mediating role of insulin resistance (IR). In Hefei Hongsifang Company, 743 employees aged 40-60 were recruited consecutively. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between body composition and hypertension risk. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore the mediating role of IR between body composition and hypertension risk. Individuals with higher body fat percentage (BF%) (OR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.64-3.65, P < 0.001) and Visceral adiposity index (VAI) (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.39-3.55, P < 0.001) had significantly higher odds of hypertension. Conversely, higher levels of skeletal muscle mass percentage (SMM%) (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.21-0.56, P < 0.001), total body water percentage (TBW%) (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.59, P < 0.001), and bone mineral content percentage (BMC%) (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.54, P < 0.001) were all linked to lower odds of hypertension. IR significantly mediated the associations between body composition and hypertension risk. The mediation proportions were as follows: 29.4% for BF%, 61.5% for VAI, 33.7% for SMM%, 34.9% for TBW%, and 31.4% for BMC%. Our study demonstrated that, in middle-aged individuals, lower BF% and VAI, as well as higher SMM%, TBW%, and BMC%, were independently associated with a reduced risk of hypertension. IR partially mediated the associations between body composition and hypertension.",3
Monoclonal antibody targeting of N-cadherin encourages castration resistance.,monoclonal antibody targeting AND N-cadherin AND castration resistance AND prostate cancer,"21057494,35703345,41187218","[PMID: 21057494] The transition from androgen-dependent to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal event of uncertain molecular etiology. Comparing gene expression in isogenic androgen-dependent and CRPC xenografts, we found a reproducible increase in N-cadherin expression, which was also elevated in primary and metastatic tumors of individuals with CRPC. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin in nonmetastatic, androgen-dependent prostate cancer models caused castration resistance, invasion and metastasis. Monoclonal antibodies against the ectodomain of N-cadherin reduced proliferation, adhesion and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, these antibodies slowed the growth of multiple established CRPC xenografts, blocked local invasion and metastasis and, at higher doses, led to complete regression. N-cadherin-specific antibodies markedly delayed the time to emergence of castration resistance, markedly affected tumor histology and angiogenesis, and reduced both AKT serine-threonine kinase activity and serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. These data indicate that N-cadherin is a major cause of both prostate cancer metastasis and castration resistance. Therapeutic targeting of this factor with monoclonal antibodies may have considerable clinical benefit.

[PMID: 35703345] Prostate cancer (PCa) is a key public health problem worldwide; at diagnosis, a high percentage of patients exhibit tumor cell invasion of adjacent tissue. STAT‑3, IL‑6 receptor (R) and IL‑6 serum levels are associated with enhanced PCa migratory, invasive, clonogenic and metastatic ability. Inhibiting the STAT‑3 pathway at different levels (cytokines, receptors, and kinases) exhibits relative success in cancer. The present study investigated the effect of Stattic (Stt) + Tocilizumab (Tcz) on proliferative, clonogenic, migratory and invasive ability of human metastatic PCa (assessed by colony formation, wound healing and migration assay). RWPE‑1 (epithelial prostate immortalized cells), 22Rv1 (Tumor cells), LNCaP (Metastatic cells) and DU‑145 (metastatic, castration‑resistant prostate cells) cells were used <i>in vitro</i> to evaluate levels of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors (Cytometric Bead Array), STAT‑3, phosphorylated STAT‑3 (In‑Cell Western), IL‑6R, vimentin and epithelial (E‑) cadherin (Western Blot). The effect of inhibition of STAT‑3 (expressed constitutively in DU‑145 cells) with Stt and/or Tcz on expression levels of vimentin, VEGF, and E‑cadherin, as well as proliferative, clonogenic, migratory and invasive capacity of metastatic PCa cells was assessed. The expression levels of IL‑6, C‑X‑C chemokine ligand 8, VEGF and vimentin, as well as proliferation and migration, were increased in metastatic PCa cells. Treatment with Stt or Tcz decreased vimentin and VEGF and increased E‑cadherin expression levels and inhibited proliferative, clonogenic, migratory and invasive capacity of DU‑145 cells; addition of IL‑6 decreased this inhibitory effect. However, Stt + Tcz maintained inhibition even in the present of high concentrations of IL‑6. Stt + Tcz decreased expression of vimentin and VEGF and inhibited the proliferative, clonogenic, migratory and invasive capacity of metastatic PCa cells. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to combine Stt, a STAT‑3 inhibitor, with Tcz, an antibody against IL‑6R, to target tumor cells.

[PMID: 41187218] Given the urgent need for more specific, sensitive, and non-invasive markers for prostate cancer screening and differential diagnosis, circulating miRNAs have emerged as valuable candidates. Sixty seven prostate cancer subjects in different stages were included in this study. The participants were categorized into groups based on their pathological characteristics as local, biochemical relapse and metastatic. We retrieved eligible datasets from GEO database to identify stage-specific differentially expressed up/down-regulated genes. Cytohubba, built-in application of Cytoscape software, and Reactome pathway database were applied to select hub genes. To select upstream miRNAs, we utilized the MiRWalk and miRNet online tools. To construct the miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks, we employed rna22. Finally, three miRNAs and five target genes were validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PCa patients compared with benign prostate hyperplasia. PSA level was also measured using ELISA. Our findings revealed the potential role of PRC1 and UBA52 to be used as biomarkers for the metastatic stage, RCC1 for both biochemical relapse, and metastatic subjects. Furthermore, elevated levels of miR-124-3p and downregulation of miR-133a-3p can be introduced as biochemical relapse stage identifier. We also identified the tumor suppressor role of miR-17-5p, which was associated with higher Gleason scores. We propose PRC1, UBA52, RCC1, miR-124-3p and miR133a-3p as stage-specific PCa identifiers.",3
Monoclonal antibody targeting of N-cadherin encourages metastasis.,Monoclonal Antibodies AND N-cadherin AND Metastasis AND Cancer,"38030131,35583238,39082961","[PMID: 38030131] Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) is characterised by invasive and metastatic behaviour and is poorly responsive to current treatments, hence the need for new therapeutic strategies. FOSCC shares molecular targets with human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), among these the epidermal growth factor receptor. Cetuximab is an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody employed in the therapy of HNSCC and, interestingly, previous work in vitro suggested that it displays cytostatic and cytotoxic properties also against FOSCC. With the present study, we aimed at further investigating the effects of cetuximab on invasion and metastasis pathways proven to be relevant in human patients. To this purpose, FOSCC cell lines SCCF1, SCCF2 and SCCF3 were treated with cetuximab for 48/72 h and subjected to Western blot for matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers vimentin, E-, P- and N-cadherin. Treatment with cetuximab resulted in downregulation of MMP-2/-9 in all of the three cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, cetuximab downregulated vimentin and P-cadherin in SCCF1, upregulated E-cadherin whilst downregulating P-/N-cadherins in SCCF2, and impaired P-/N-cadherins in SCCF3. An in vitro scratch test also demonstrated that cetuximab delayed cell migration in SCCF3. These data suggest that cetuximab mitigates invasion and metastasis processes by impairing MMPs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways in FOSCC, indicating that this monoclonal antibody may help to counteract malignant progression and improve the management of locally invasive disease.

[PMID: 35583238] Cadherins are cell-surface proteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion. By regulating their grip formation and strength, cadherins play a pivotal role during normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. However, their dysfunction is associated with cell migration and proliferation, cancer progression and metastasis. The conserved amino acid sequence His-Ala-Val (HAV) in the extracellular domain of cadherins is implicated in cadherin-mediated adhesion and migration. Antagonists of cadherin adhesion such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors based on HAV peptides, are of high therapeutic value in cancer treatment. However, antibodies are not stable outside their natural environment and are expensive to produce, while peptides have certain limitations as a drug as they are prone to proteolysis. Herein, we propose as alternative, a synthetic antibody based on molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP-NGs) to target the HAV domain. The MIP-NGs are biocompatible, have high affinity for N-cadherin and inhibit cell adhesion and migration of human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells, as demonstrated by cell aggregation and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. The emergence of MIPs as therapeutics for fighting cancer is still in its infancy and this novel demonstration reinforces the fact that they have a rightful place in cancer treatment.

[PMID: 39082961] HCC is one of the most lethal cancers for humans. Mannosidase alpha class 2A member 1 (MAN2A1)-FER is one of the most frequent oncogenic fusion genes in HCC. In this report, we showed that MAN2A1-FER ectopically phosphorylated the extracellular domains of PDGFRA, MET, AXL, and N-cadherin. The ectopic phosphorylation of these transmembrane proteins led to the activation of their kinase activities and initiated the activation cascades of their downstream signaling molecules. A panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies was developed to recognize the ectopic phosphorylation sites of PDGFRA. The analyses showed that these antibodies bound to the specific phosphotyrosine epitopes in the extracellular domain of PDGFRA with high affinity and specificity. The treatment of MAN2A1-FER-positive cancer HUH7 with one of the antibodies called 2-3B-G8 led to the deactivation of cell growth signaling pathways and cell growth arrest while having minimal impact on HUH7ko cells where MAN2A1-FER expression was disrupted. The treatment of 2-3B-G8 antibody also led to a large number of cell deaths of MAN2A1-FER-positive cancer cells such as HUH7, HEPG2, SNU449, etc., while the same treatment had no impact on HUH7ko cells. When severe combined immunodeficiency mice xenografted with HEPG2 or HUH7 were treated with monomethyl auristatin E-conjugated 2-3B-G8 antibody, it slowed the progression of tumor growth, eliminated the metastasis, and reduced the mortality, in comparison with the controls. Targeting the cancer-specific ectopic phosphorylation sites of PDGFRA induced by MAN2A1-FER may hold promise as an effective treatment for liver cancer.",3

A randomized parallel-group study was conducted at four health centers (Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, and Matanga in the southeastern region and Ankazomborona in the northwestern region). The therapeutic efficacy and safety of ASAQ and AL were assessed using the WHO protocol, with a 28-day follow-up period. Children aged 6 months to 14 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria were randomly assigned to receive either ASAQ or AL. Genotyping assays for the pfK13 gene were conducted on P. falciparum isolates obtained from dry blood samples collected on Day 0. Of 765 enrolled patients, 709 (92.7%) reached the study endpoint. Among the per-protocol population, crude adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rates were 99%, 99%, 100%, and 100% for Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, Matanga, and Ankazomborona, respectively, in the ASAQ group and 98%, 91%, 90%, and 100% for the same locations, respectively, in the AL group. Polymerase chain reaction-corrected ACPR rates were 100% for the ASAQ group at all study sites, whereas for the AL group, they were 98.8% in Antsenavolo, 97.6% in Vohitromby, 100% in Matanga, and 100% in Ankazomborona. Day 3 slide positivity rates were 0%, 1%, 1%, and 0% for Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, Matanga, and Ankazomborona, respectively. During follow-up, mild and moderate adverse events, including gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain and vomiting) and headache, were reported in 10.2% (72/709) of patients. Of 727 samples successfully analyzed for pfK13, no mutation associated with artemisinin resistance was observed. The study results reveal that ASAQ and AL remain safe and efficacious for treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Madagascar.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41187195] Serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening is crucial for early diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. This study presents the results of CrAg screening among people living with HIV (PLWH) followed in our clinic over the past six years. Patients with a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells/µL who were tested for CrAg were included in the study. Data regarding age, gender, comorbidities, CD4+ T cell count, HIV RNA level, blood culture results, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings-including CrAg, microscopy, culture, and PCR-were retrospectively collected. Descriptive statistical methods were used for the analysis. Serum CrAg testing was performed on 99 patients, nine of whom tested positive. Among the patients with positive antigenemia, four were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. In two cases, serum CrAg positivity was interpreted as false-positive due to the absence of clinical or laboratory findings consistent with cryptococcal infection. One patient died shortly after the CrAg test and could not be further evaluated. Two patients were lost to follow-up; however, one of them presented with symptoms two months later and was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. Additionally, there was one patient with confirmed cryptococcal meningitis despite an initial negative serum CrAg result. CrAg positivity may be detected during the asymptomatic phase of cryptococcal infection. Although current guidelines recommend serum CrAg screening for individuals with CD4+ T cell counts below 100 cells/µL, the detection of positive results in those with CD4+ T cell counts above this threshold should also be carefully evaluated, considering the possibility of false-positive or false-negative results.",3
N348I mutations reduce resistance to nevirapine.,N348I mutation AND resistance AND nevirapine AND scientific articles,20194692,"[PMID: 20194692] Recent reports have described the effect of mutations in the connection and RNase H domains of reverse transcriptase (RT) on nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI and NNRTI, respectively) resistance in the presence of thymidine analog resistance mutations (TAMs) and NNRTI mutations (J.

In the present study, novel mutations in the connection domain of RT (T369I/V), first identified in patient-derived viruses, were characterized, and their effects on NNRTI and NNRTI susceptibility were determined. Furthermore, the effect of N348I on NRTI and NNRTI resistance was confirmed. HIV-1 with either N348I or T369I/V demonstrated reduced susceptibility to nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), delaviridine (DLV), and zidovudine (ZDV) compared to wild-type HIV-1. However, HIV-1 with T369I and N348I demonstrated 10- to 60-fold resistance to these same drugs. In clinical samples, these two connection domain RT mutations were predominantly observed in viruses containing TAMs and NNRTI mutations and did not alter the susceptible-resistant classifications of these samples. Introduction of T369I, N348I, or T369I/N348I also reduced replication capacity (RC). These observations suggest that it may be of scientific interest to test these mutations against new NNRTI candidates.",1
NR5A2 does not play a role in development of endometrial tissues.,NR5A2 AND NR5A2 function AND endometrial tissue development AND no role,"41187379,41187348,41187343","[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187348] The Casimir force, an attractive force between two parallel, uncharged, perfectly conducting plates separated by a small gap has attracted much attention not only because it is fascinating phenomenon in quantum electrodynamics, but also because of its important applications in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Although the Casimir force is extremely small, it plays a dominant role in the MEMS when the distance between device components is also very small. The failure of MEMS due to stiction caused by attractive force motivates the study of repulsive Casimir force. As a result, more and more derivative concepts related to the Casimir force have emerged. Aside from the attractive and repulsive Casimir forces, the lateral Casimir force can occur between sinusoidally corrugated surfaces. Casimir friction appears when two plates are in relative motion even if they are not in direct contact. Such phenomena reveals the non-intuitive nature of the quantum vacuum, but also demonstrate potential applications in nanoscience and quantum technology. In addition, a rotating nanoparticle can also experience a lateral Casimir force when it rotates near a plate, the underlying mechanism is different from that occuring between corrugated surfaces. In particular, when the nanoparticle rotates in the proximity of an optical anisotropic plate, an axial Casimir force along the direction of the rotation axis is exerted on the nanoparticle. At present, these novel phenomena related to the Casimir force form the foundation of Casimir physics research. Here, we focus on the recent progress in the theoretical and experimental research on the Casimir effect including the attractive Casimir force, repulsive Casimir force, lateral Casimir force, and Casimir friction. We also review the applications of various Casimir effects in the field of nanotechnology. The Casimir effect provides new perspectives on MEMS and quantum information processing, and may inspire new experimental approaches and technological applications. This phenomenon holds substantial scientific significance and promising application potential across both fundamental research and engineering fields.

[PMID: 41187343] IntroductionMental health in children is significantly influenced by socio-economic status, poverty, and income inequality. However, existing child psychiatric research focuses on clinical variables and developed nations. Hence, this study explored the impact of these factors on the psychosocial functioning of children visiting a mental health clinic in India.MethodsA cross-sectional research design was employed, with data collected from children and their parents/caregivers using the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS). Participants included 120 children recruited from an out-patient clinic in a tertiary mental healthcare center. Non-parametric tests were employed to examine the influence of socio-economic status and poverty on functioning among the participants.ResultsOur study observed significant differences in functioning scores related to socio-economic status, monthly family income, and sources of income, with family income source significantly affecting disability scores. A significant proportion of the participants scored below the functioning benchmark and above the disability benchmark.ConclusionSocio-economic disparities and income inequality significantly influence mental health outcomes. The findings emphasize the role of social determinants of mental health and underscore the importance of integrating mental health services with socio-economic support systems.",3
Natriuretic peptides increase susceptibility to diabetes.,natriuretic peptides AND diabetes susceptibility AND insulin resistance AND glucose metabolism,32112822,"[PMID: 32112822] Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) plays a key role in fatty acid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. In the context of dyslipemia, LRP1 is upregulated in the heart. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of cardiomyocyte LRP1 deficiency on high fat diet (HFD)-induced cardiac and metabolic alterations, and to explore the potential mechanisms involved. We used TnT-iCre transgenic mice with thoroughly tested suitability to delete genes exclusively in cardiomyocytes to generate an experimental mouse model with conditional Lrp1 deficiency in cardiomyocytes (TNT-iCre<sup>+</sup>-LRP1<sup>flox/flox</sup>). Mice with Lrp1-deficient cardiomyocytes (cm-Lrp1<sup>-/-</sup>) have a normal cardiac function combined with a favorable metabolic phenotype against HFD-induced glucose intolerance and obesity. Glucose intolerance protection was linked to higher hepatic fatty acid oxidation (FAO), lower liver steatosis and increased whole-body energy expenditure. Proteomic studies of the heart revealed decreased levels of cardiac pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP), which was parallel to higher ANP circulating levels. cm-Lrp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed ANP signaling activation that was linked to increased fatty acid (FA) uptake and increased AMPK/ ACC phosphorylation in the liver. Natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) antagonist completely abolished ANP signaling and metabolic protection in cm-Lrp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These results indicate that an ANP-dependent axis controlled by cardiac LRP1 levels modulates AMPK activity in the liver, energy homeostasis and whole-body metabolism.",1
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is not predictive of acute respiratory failure after solid organ transplantation.,Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation AND Acute Respiratory Failure AND Solid Organ Transplantation AND Ventilatory Support,"41183953,41181863,41181765","[PMID: 41183953] This study focused on ventilatory management during robot-assisted laparoscopic rectal resection in an obese patient, using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to evaluate lung conditions. The case involved a 40s male with a history of smoking, obesity (BMI:31), and iodine allergy. General anesthesia was induced, and EIT was employed to assess positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during different surgical positions. The study found that the PEEP for supine positioning was 10-12 cmH2O for ventilatory conditions in which the anterior and posterior impedance changes were equal in patients, but during pneumoperitoneum and head lowering, a higher PEEP of 20 cmH2O was necessary to prevent lung collapse. This differed from conventional recommendations. Oxygenation was maintained, and the patient had no major complications. The study suggests that EIT may offer a noninvasive and bedside approach to evaluating ventilator settings, potentially changing perspectives on intraoperative ventilator management. J. Med.

[PMID: 41181863] Individuals with Parkinson's disease may be more susceptible to severe coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 outcomes due to advanced age and neurological and systemic impairments. However, the evidence on this association remains inconclusive. This study investigates the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in hospitalized patients with Parkinson's disease. Secondary data from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System were obtained from the OpenData-SUS platform of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, covering March 2020 to March 2024. Variables included demographics, comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, ventilatory and intensive care unit (ICU) support, hospital stay, and outcomes. Missing data were imputed, and descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable analyses were conducted using 5% significance level. Among 1 725 690 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Brazil, 4907 (0.3%) had Parkinson's disease. Overall mortality was 37.2%, while mortality among Parkinson's patients reached 53.1% (OR = 1.920; 95% CI = 1.815-2.031), indicating a significantly higher risk. Death was independently associated with advanced age, male sex, low vaccination coverage, and cardiovascular or chronic respiratory diseases. Age strongly predicted both Parkinson's diagnosis and mortality. Parkinson's patients had higher ICU admission rates and more frequent need for invasive ventilation. Multivariable analysis confirmed Parkinson's disease as an independent mortality risk factor (OR = 1.277; 95% CI = 1.198-1.360). The logistic regression model for mortality demonstrated good discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.810 (95% CI = 0.809-0.811), indicating reliable performance in distinguishing patients who experienced the outcome. Parkinson's disease is associated with higher mortality and greater ICU needs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings underscore the need for targeted prevention, close monitoring, and tailored clinical management for this vulnerable group, especially considering their age and comorbid conditions.

[PMID: 41181765] Background Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders were commonly used in patients with severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with variation across different healthcare settings. We evaluated the practices of DNR orders in patients with severe COVID-19 at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 who required ICU admission in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between March and December 2020. We compared patients with DNR orders during ICU stay to those without and described their clinical condition on the day of DNR order implementation. Results Among 470 patients (median age 62.0 years, 348 (74.0%) were males, 207 (44.0%) used high-flow nasal cannula and/or noninvasive ventilation without intubation, and 263 (56.0%) needed intubation), 30.6% (N = 144) received DNR orders after a median of 10 days in the ICU. Patients with DNR orders were older and had more comorbidities. On the DNR order day, 126 patients (87.5%) were on invasive mechanical ventilation (median fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.80), 84 (58.3%) were on vasopressors, and 42 (29.2%) were on renal replacement therapy. The median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 13. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (odds ratio (OR) per one-year increase, 1.052) and intubation (OR, 3.757) were associated with DNR orders. The hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with DNR orders (133/144 (92.4%) vs. 61/326 (18.7%), p < 0.0001). Conclusions DNR orders were commonly used in patients with severe COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, typically after one week of ICU admission. Key predictors were older age and persistent organ failure.",3
Nonsteroidal antinflammatory drugs are ineffective as cancer treatments.,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs AND Cancer treatment AND Ineffective AND Anticancer effects,"31584382,34234410,32061771","[PMID: 31584382] Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal and aggressive human malignancies. Studies have shown that Cancer Stem-Cell (CSC) phenotype is mainly responsible for ATC aggressiveness. Cytostatic compounds are mostly ineffective because of multidrug resistance mechanisms driven by the CSC phenotype. Taxanes have limited efficacy. Recently, CSC inhibition using plant-derived, less toxic compounds, which have anti-cancer efficacy, has become a novel treatment modality. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of two natural compounds (curcumin and deguelin) on ATC cells and their CSC properties. In addition, the efficacies of these compounds were compared with that of docetaxel. Besides control, five treatment groups were formed. ATC cells (CAL-62) were treated with curcumin, deguelin, docetaxel, and their combinations (curcumin+docetaxel, deguelin+docetaxel) at previously determined IC50 doses. Stemness was analyzed by quantitative estimation of sphere formation in matrigel, expression of several cell surface markers (CD133, CD90, Nanog, and OCT3/4) using flow cytometry, and quantification of the hypoxic status [Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity]. The anti-cancer efficacies of these compounds and their combinations were evaluated by determining the alterations in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumoral cell migration. Both the natural compounds (particularly curcumin) significantly suppressed the spheroid formation and cellular motility in matrigel as well as suppressed the accumulation of cells in the G0/1 phase, in which the maximum CSC activity is observed. The compounds did not suppress the expression of CSC markers, but twothirds of the cells expressed CD90. Deguelin was found to be particularly effective in inducing apoptosis similar to docetaxel at IC50 concentrations. Curcumin reduced the OSI and deguelin enhanced the SOD activity, even in docetaxel pre-treated cells. A large proportion of anaplastic tumors might consist of heterogeneous CSC population. Curcumin and deguelin have anti-cancer and several anti-stem cell activities against ATC cells. These natural compounds are capable of altering the aggressive behavior of ATC cells through the inhibition of the CSC phenotype. As a novel therapeutic target, CD90 should be investigated in other ATC cell lines and in vivo models.

[PMID: 34234410] Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). However, current GBM treatments are ineffective, signifying the great importance of exploring new therapeutic targets. Curcumin has been found to be a natural compound with an anticancer potential. However, its targets and mechanisms in GBM are still unclear. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from the GBM dataset in the GEO database and intersected with the target genes of curcumin to select potential target genes. Subsequently, survival analysis was performed with the GEPIA database to confirm the effect of target genes on the prognosis of GBM, and functional enrichment analysis was performed using the DAVID database. In vitro, CCK-8 assay was used to screen the appropriate concentration of curcumin; scratch and transwell invasion assays were used to evaluate the effect of curcumin on the migration and invasion abilities of GBM cells. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to detect changes in target genes and flow cytometry was used to assess the apoptosis level. A total of 16 target genes of curcumin and GBM were obtained, among which <i>ENO1, MMP2</i>, and <i>PRKD2</i> significantly affected the prognosis (<i>P</i> < 0.05). We further selected <i>ENO1</i> for functional enrichment analysis and found that it was enriched in the glycolytic pathway. Meanwhile, in vitro experiments showed that curcumin could inhibit the migration and invasion of U251 cells and promote apoptosis (<i>P</i> < 0.05). <i>ENO1</i> could be a possible target for curcumin in the suppression of GBM cells.

[PMID: 32061771] Pancreatic cancer has poor survival rates and largely ineffective therapies. Aspirin is the prototypical anti-cancer agent but its long-term use is associated with significant side effects. NOSH-aspirin belongs to a new class of anti-inflammatory agents that were designed to be safer alternatives by releasing nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide. In this study we evaluated the effects of NOSH-aspirin against pancreatic cancer using cell lines and a xenograft mouse model. NOSH-aspirin inhibited growth of MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 47 ± 5, and 57 ± 4 nM, respectively, while it did not inhibit growth of a normal pancreatic epithelial cell line at these concentrations. NOSH-aspirin inhibited cell proliferation, caused G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase cycle arrest, leading to increased apoptosis. Treated cells displayed increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 activity. In MIA PaCa-2 cell xenografts, NOSH-aspirin significantly reduced tumor growth and tumor mass. Growth inhibition was due to reduced proliferation (decreased PCNA expression) and induction of apoptosis (increased TUNEL positive cells). Expressions of ROS, iNOS, and mutated p53 were increased; while that of NF-κB and FoxM1 that were high in vehicle-treated xenografts were significantly inhibited by NOSH-aspirin. Taken together, these molecular events and signaling pathways contribute to NOSH-aspirin mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic death of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.",3
Normal granulomas form in the presence of TNF in Zebrafish.,granuloma AND TNF-alpha AND zebrafish AND formation,"35177649,27806130,22851747","[PMID: 35177649] Prevalence of Mycobacterium abscessus infections is increasing in patients with respiratory comorbidities. After initial colonisation, M. abscessus smooth colony (S) variants can undergo an irreversible genetic switch into highly inflammatory, rough colony (R) variants, often associated with a decline in pulmonary function. Here, we use an adult zebrafish model of chronic infection with R and S variants to study M. abscessus pathogenesis in the context of fully functioning host immunity. We show that infection with an R variant causes an inflammatory immune response that drives necrotic granuloma formation through host TNF signalling, mediated by the tnfa, tnfr1 and tnfr2 gene products. T cell-dependent immunity is stronger against the R variant early in infection, and regulatory T cells associate with R variant granulomas and limit bacterial growth. In comparison, an S variant proliferates to high burdens but appears to be controlled by TNF-dependent innate immunity early during infection, resulting in delayed granuloma formation. Thus, our work demonstrates the applicability of adult zebrafish to model persistent M. abscessus infection, and illustrates differences in the immunopathogenesis induced by R and S variants during granulomatous infection.

[PMID: 27806130] Mycobacterium abscessus is considered the most common respiratory pathogen among the rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Infections with M. abscessus are increasingly found in patients with chronic lung diseases, especially cystic fibrosis, and are often refractory to antibiotic therapy. M. abscessus has two morphotypes with distinct effects on host cells and biological responses. The smooth (S) variant is recognized as the initial airway colonizer while the rough (R) is known to be a potent inflammatory inducer associated with invasive disease, but the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of the infection remain unsolved. We conducted a comparative stepwise dissection of the inflammatory response in S and R pathogenesis by monitoring infected transparent zebrafish embryos. Loss of TNFR1 function resulted in increased mortality with both variants, and was associated with unrestricted intramacrophage bacterial growth and decreased bactericidal activity. The use of transgenic zebrafish lines harboring fluorescent macrophages and neutrophils revealed that neutrophils, like macrophages, interact with M. abscessus at the initial infection sites. Impaired TNF signaling disrupted the IL8-dependent neutrophil mobilization, and the defect in neutrophil trafficking led to the formation of aberrant granulomas, extensive mycobacterial cording, unrestricted bacterial growth and subsequent larval death. Our findings emphasize the central role of neutrophils for the establishment and maintenance of the protective M. abscessus granulomas. These results also suggest that the TNF/IL8 inflammatory axis is necessary for protective immunity against M. abscessus and may be of clinical relevance to explain why immunosuppressive TNF therapy leads to the exacerbation of M. abscessus infections.

[PMID: 22851747] SecA2 is an ATPase present in some pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, is required for translocation of a limited set of proteins across the cytosolic membrane, and plays an important role in virulence in several bacteria, including mycobacteria that cause diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy. However, the mechanisms by which SecA2 affects virulence are incompletely understood. To investigate whether SecA2 modulates host immune responses in vivo, we studied Mycobacterium marinum infection in two different hosts: an established zebrafish model and a recently described mouse model. Here we show that M. marinum ΔsecA2 was attenuated for virulence in both host species and SecA2 was needed for normal granuloma numbers and for optimal tumor necrosis factor alpha response in both zebrafish and mice. M. marinum ΔsecA2 was more sensitive to SDS and had unique protrusions from its cell envelope when examined by cryo-electron tomography, suggesting that SecA2 is important for bacterial cell wall integrity. These results provide evidence that SecA2 induces granulomas and is required for bacterial modulation of the host response because it affects the mycobacterial cell envelope.",3

Although the current data are limited, studies suggest that the GM composition in AF mirrors that observed in associated conditions such as heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease (characterized by increased genera <i>Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus</i>, and decreased genus <i>Faecalibacterium</i>). Additionally, patients with AF appear to have distinct microbial alterations, including increased abundances of the genera <i>Dialister, Dorea, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Lachnospira, Parabacteroides, Ruminococcus</i>, and <i>Veillonella</i> and decreased abundances of the genera <i>Butyricicoccus, Hungatella</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>. Gut-derived metabolites also show associations with AF. Trimethylamine <i>N</i>-oxide and choline have been linked to new-onset and postoperative AF, potentially via autonomic, inflammatory, and fibrotic pathways. In contrast, short-chain fatty acids, which are reduced in AF patients, may offer protective effects. Elevated lipopolysaccharide levels are correlated with AF onset and recurrence through inflammation and structural remodeling. Indoxyl sulfate and bile acids may contribute to arrhythmogenesis via oxidative stress, apoptosis, and disrupted calcium signaling. These mechanisms contribute to AF by disrupting conduction and increasing automaticity. Emerging evidence also links gut microbes to other arrhythmias, but more research is needed to clarify causality and therapeutic potential.

[PMID: 41171588] Hair thinning is a prevalent concern influenced by multiple factors including stress, hormonal changes, diet, and lifestyle, with varying impacts across demographic groups. Oral supplements addressing these key root causes through a multi-targeting, patented, botanical-based Synergen Complex have been developed to combat hair thinning across different populations. This study sought to build on existing evidence from previous clinical studies evaluating hair growth and quality by evaluating the effectiveness of these nutraceuticals in enhancing hair fiber diameter, and thus hair strength and length, in adults with thinning hair. This 6-month, prospective, open-label study included women, plant-based women, menopausal women, parous women, and men consuming commercially available hair growth nutraceuticals (HGNs) targeted to different demographics (Nutrafol<sup>®</sup> Women, Vegan, Balance, Postpartum, and Men). All subjects had hair thinning, self-reported and confirmed by the study dermatologist. Assessments occurred at baseline, day 90, and day 180. Measurements included hair shaft diameter via light microscopy, hair breakage/shedding via a four-region hair pull test, investigator global assessment (IGA) of hair parameters, and subject self-perception questionnaire. A total of 252 participants enrolled, with 244 completing the study per protocol. Ingestion of the HGNs was associated with a significant increase in hair shaft diameter across all groups by day 180. Hair pull tests showed significant reductions in intact, broken, and total hair shedding overall. In-person IGA was correlated with significant improvements in hair attributes-strength, length, thickness, and overall hair health-across all groups. Self-perception data revealed strong agreement across groups with statements regarding hair improvements by day 180. This study demonstrates that ingestion of these bio-specific HGNs are associated with significantly enhanced hair shaft diameter and decreased breakage, resulting in longer, stronger hair across their intended populations. These findings support the use of these HGNs for hair thinning, offering alternative options for various populations for improving hair growth and thickness. gov identifier, NCT06362941.

[PMID: 41165739] Neurological disorders (NDs) represent a significant global health challenges, with neurodegeneration being a common pathological feature. Recent investigations indicate the involvement of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in these disorders, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive decline. The gut-brain axis, a communication network between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS), is influenced by microbial metabolites, which can cross the blood-brain barrier and impact brain function. Key metabolites such as trimethylamine <i>N</i>-oxide (TMAO), para-cresol sulfate (pCS), 4-ethylphenyl sulfate (4-EPS), and indoxyl sulfate (IS) have been linked with the progression of neurological disorders. TMAO disrupts blood-brain barrier integrity, promotes oxidative stress, and activates microglial cells, which lead to the apoptosis of neurons, resulting in neuroinflammation. This could also result in psychiatric changes and behavioral disorders. pCS produced from gut bacteria metabolizing dietary proteins is correlated with amplified oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments in disorders like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, elevated 4-EPS levels are linked to autism spectrum disorder, contributing to anxiety-like behavior and blood-brain barrier disruption. Understanding the mechanisms by which gut-derived metabolites affect neurological health could lead to novel therapeutic strategies that can target gut microbiota for the medication and treatment of neurological disorders. Dietary precursors and gut microbiota metabolites, modulated by probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics, play a critical role in maintaining microbiota homeostasis and influencing neurological health, needing sophisticated biosensors to enable real-time monitoring and early intervention in disorders linked to gut metabolite imbalances.",3

Only 28.4% of estimated enrollment was achieved for all discontinued RCT. Nineteen (79.2%) investigators provided a reason for discontinuation, which most commonly included poor enrollment (45.8%), inadequate supplies or funding (12.5%), and trial design concerns (8.3%). Of the 20 trials terminated following enrollment, 20.0% (4/20) were published in peer-reviewed journals and 80.0% (16/20) failed to reach publication. Of the 77.8% trials completed, 75.0% (63/84) were published and 25.0% (21/84) remain unpublished. In a multivariate regression of completed trials, industry funding was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of peer-reviewed publication (OR = 0.18, (95% CI 0.05-0.71), P = 0.01). Of the discontinued and completed trials remaining unpublished, 62.5% and 61.9% failed to report results on ClinicalTrials.gov, respectively, encompassing a total of 4,788 enrollees without publicly available results. Nearly 25% of registered vascular RCT were discontinued. Of completed RCT, 25% remain unpublished with industry funding associated with decreased likelihood of publication. This study identifies opportunities to report all findings for completed and discontinued vascular surgery RCT, whether industry sponsored, or investigator initiated.

[PMID: 41187260] The venipuncture is one of the most frequently performed procedures in health care. Arm phantoms are available for training, because the procedure itself can be challenging. These phantom arms do not represent a realistic setting and do not offer opportunities to train challenging scenarios. This randomized, single-blind study aimed to train health care workers on both a commercially available injection arm and an in-house developed 3D-printed arm, to evaluate the perceived realism and adequacy of training on both arms. Participants were trained on both the commercially available arm (arm A) and the 3D-printed arm (arm B). Participants were randomized and blinded from knowing which arm they started training on. A questionnaire was filled in on, among others, the perceived realism of the arm (0 for not realistic, 100 for realistic) and adequacy of the training (inadequate, moderate, or adequate). A total of 68 participants evaluated the perceived realism of arm A and B, which were scored on average 62.97 (SD 21.47) and 63.79 (SD 17.45), respectively. The difference in perceived realism of the two arms was not statistically significant (based on the paired t test, mean difference=-0.82, P=.78). Training on arm A was reported inadequate by 7% (5/68 participants), moderately adequate by 31% (21/68), and adequate by 62% (42/68). This was not significantly different from arm B (marginal homogeneity test, P=.74), with 4% (3/68), 38% (26/68), and 57% (39/68), respectively, reporting that the training was inadequate, moderately adequate, and adequate. The 3D-printed arm is as realistic and provides an equally adequate training compared to the commercially available arm. The 3D-printed arm offers the additional possibility to design different models representing several levels of difficulty for vascular morphology. This potentially lowers the number of venipuncture failures by preparing health care workers on challenging scenarios.

[PMID: 41187137] Sleep disturbances are common among older adults, affecting up to 50% of this population and significantly impacting quality of life and health outcomes. Music therapy has been proposed as a non-pharmacological intervention to improve sleep quality in this population, but evidence regarding its effectiveness remains inconsistent across individual studies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize available evidence on the effectiveness of music therapy interventions for improving sleep quality in elderly adults.. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. Major databases were searched for studies evaluating music interventions for sleep quality in adults aged 50 + years. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for RCTs and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for non-RCTs. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using both common effect and random effects models. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The initial search retrieved 473 articles from electronic databases. After removing duplicates and screening, 10 studies (6 RCTs, 4 non-RCTs) published between 2010 and 2023 with 602 participants met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The random effects model showed significant improvement in sleep quality with music therapy (SMD: -0.79; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.33; P < .001). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I² = 79%; Q = 42.54; P < .001). Subgroup analysis revealed significant benefits in RCTs (SMD: -0.59; 95% CI, -1.11 to -0.07) but not in non-RCTs (SMD: -1.08; 95% CI, -2.36 to 0.19). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of findings, and no publication bias was detected. GRADE assessment indicated very low certainty of evidence for both RCTs and non-RCTs due to risk of bias concerns and substantial heterogeneity. Music therapy demonstrates significant improvement in sleep quality among older adults; however, the very low certainty of evidence based on GRADE assessment suggests caution in clinical recommendations. Future research should address methodological limitations, particularly regarding bias in outcome measurement and intervention implementation, to provide more definitive evidence for clinical practice guidelines.",3
PKG-la does not have a large impact on expression of pain hypersensitivity in PGK-la knockout mice.,PKG-alpha AND pain hypersensitivity AND knockout mice AND expression,"41187268,41187251,41187279","[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187251] Paralytic ileus is a frequent complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), contributing to increased morbidity, nutritional compromise, and risk of infection. Despite its clinical relevance, data on its incidence, predictors, management, and outcomes in AP remain limited. We conducted a retrospective study of 426 adult patients admitted with AP over a 3-year period at a tertiary-care center. The primary outcome was paralytic ileus; secondary outcomes included infected necrosis, intervention, and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors expressed as adjusted odds ratio (aOR). Paralytic ileus occurred in 167/426 (39.2%) patients. Patients with ileus were more frequently male, obese, and had higher rates of SIRS compared to those without ileus. They also exhibited significantly higher leukocyte counts, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), serum creatinine, and lower serum albumin and sodium levels. In multivariate analysis, obesity (aOR: 2.329), NLR (aOR: 1.131), serum albumin (aOR: 0.342), and serum sodium (aOR: 0.802) were identified as independent predictors. An NLR of 9.5 had a sensitivity of 82.6% and a specificity of 76.1% for predicting paralytic ileus. Conservative management resolved ileus in 85% of cases, 6% responded to neostigmine, while 9% with unresolved ileus succumbed to multiorgan failure. Paralytic ileus was independently associated with increased risk of infected necrosis (aOR: 3.62), intervention (aOR: 4.43), and mortality (aOR: 4.71). Paralytic ileus affects a significant proportion of patients with moderate to severe AP and is a marker of local and systemic complications. Paralytic ileus was an independent predictor of infected necrosis, intervention, and mortality, underscoring its prognostic relevance.

[PMID: 41187279] Since January 2022, Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates has implemented the 4-day work week model for the first time in the public and private sectors, including universities. While this framework may enhance productivity and work-life balance for many professionals, the current study specifically explores the perceptions of students in medicine, dentistry, and health sciences programs regarding the impact of transitioning from a 5-day to a 4-day work week on their academic performance. The objective of this study was to explore and analyze the perceptions of students in medicine, dentistry, and health sciences regarding the implementation of a 4-day academic week in the Emirate of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Twenty-four university students (mean age 20.95, SD 1.30 years; 12 men) studying in medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, nursing, or medical diagnostic imaging programs, who experienced a transition from a 5-day week to a 4-day week, participated in semistructured interviews lasting approximately 20-30 minutes. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The Braun and Clarke 6-phase framework of thematic analysis was used. We identified 5 themes: academic journey, academic work-life balance, support systems, classroom dynamics, and common stressors of the 4-day academic week. Overall, most students reported increased motivation, engagement, and academic achievement following the transition from a 5-day to a 4-day week. In addition, participants described a positive academic work-life balance, improved physical and mental well-being, optimal use of time for both academic and personal commitments, favorable support from faculty and family members, and maintained or even improved attendance levels. Nevertheless, some students expressed concerns about condensed schedules and longer days, increased stress, disrupted work-life balance, and inadequate support systems to cope with this new framework. Overall, the 4-day academic week enhanced motivation, academic performance, work-life balance, and the physical and mental well-being of medicine, dental, and health science students. However, some students experienced challenges related to condensed schedules and increased stress. These mixed outcomes highlight that while the 4-day work week offers notable advantages, careful planning and support are essential to mitigate the potential drawbacks and ensure all students can succeed within this new academic framework. Future research could explore strategies to address these challenges and further improve the 4-day week experience for all students.",3

As a result, caregivers often face significant stress and burnout, which negatively impacts both their well-being and the quality of care they are able to provide. To address these challenges, various forms of technology have been developed to support caregiving responsibilities for people with dementia. Barriers to widespread adoption include the cost of technology, lack of caregiver training, limited awareness of available solutions, privacy and ethical concerns, and resistance to change from both caregivers and care recipients. By identifying these key insights, this study seeks to inform the development of more accessible, user-friendly, and effective technological solutions that can better support caregivers in their vital roles. This study aimed to assess the way dementia caregivers solve common challenges, focusing on technology adoption and barriers to its use. We conducted online surveys regarding technology usage and caregiving experience, which were distributed to the communities of caregivers of people living with dementia. Surveys quantified categories of technology use and caregiver needs. The survey also gathered open responses for joys, struggles, and technology use. Follow-up interviews with caregivers discussed how specific challenges were met. The responses were thematically coded to characterize findings by the type-struggles, social supports, technology, and joy. Respondents (N=69) identified access to resources as the most important unmet need for caregivers (53%). The survey found that medication and routine tracking applications and mobility assistive devices were the most commonly used forms of technology. The dominant need expressed by caregivers was for better access to resources, with improved access to health care services and financial support. Interviewees reported barriers to accessing resources, including high costs and difficulties in selecting appropriate technology resources. Additionally, centralizing resources and simplifying the process of locating support was recommended as a solution. The study showed that caregivers felt inadequately supported and did not frequently use technology due to barriers of access and usability of products. Strategies in product design and user communication that engage dementia care partners would likely accelerate adoption.

[PMID: 41186762] Fluoxastrobin (FLUO) is a fungicide from strobilurin family used widely worldwide. The use of FLUO pesticide is on the rise and this phenomenon is accompanied by a series of concerns such as endocrine disruption. In order to determine the potential toxic effects of FLUO, cell culture, gene expression and molecular docking assays were conducted as it is crucial to determine the interaction between chemicals and nuclear receptors in order to estimate and understand the impact of the chemical. This study analyzed the quantum properties of FLUO at the molecular quantum mechanical level using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-311 + + G(d, p) and cc-pVDZ basis sets including the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, chemical reactivity descriptors, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface calculation. In order to investigate molecular characteristics, topological (AIM, RDG) and Natural Bonding Orbitals (NBO) investigations were conducted. Molecular docking studies were performed with the title compound in the active sites of the proteins selected because of their role in xenobiotic metabolism. The docking result was determined to be a significant factor in bioactivity, a finding that is corroborated by the cytotoxic analysis of the FLUO compound. Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations are used to support molecular docking analysis. Toxicity of FLUO was tested on MDA-MB-231 cells using XTT and wound healing assays. IC50 value of FLUO was determined as 6,9 µg/ml. The impact of FLUO exposure at molecular level was assessed using qRT-PCR by determining the expression levels of PPARy, AhR and PXR genes where no statistically significant change was found.

[PMID: 41186626] To identify daily activity limitations, including but not limited to impairments in physical function, experienced by persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and identify Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) short form (SF) scales that can measure these limitations. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted among a diverse group of adults with RA across the spectrum of disease activity. PROMIS Upper Extremity (UE) SF7a, Physical Function (PF) SF8b, and a Task Difficulty Scale were used to assess daily activity limitations experienced by persons with RA in the United States. An open-ended question asking what other daily activity limitations respondents experienced was also included. The daily activity limitation in the text response and the three scale items were deductively coded using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) based on an established linking rule. Potential PROMIS SF scales were identified and linked to ICF to measure some activity limitations reported by persons with RA. PROMIS PF SF10a was linked to ICF and compared with UE SF7a and PF SF8b. Eighty-three out of 99 RA patient respondents answered the open-ended question, the majority (> 70%) of whom had severe or moderate physical function limitations. All 9 second-level sub-categories of the Activities and Participation (A&P) in ICF were linked to the text response to the open-ended question. UE SF7a and PF SF8b were linked to four of these second-level sub-categories (e.g., Mobility), while additional four second-level sub-categories (e.g., General tasks and demands, Interpersonal interactions and relationships) linked to PROMIS Fatigue SF7a and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities (APS) SF4a. Moreover, PF SF10a was linked to four of these second-level sub-categories too, but with fewer items than UE SF7a plus the PF SF8b. Some activity limitations, such as driving and using telecommunication devices, were not linked to any items of the five PROMIS SF scales. Persons with RA reported a variety of activity limitations across multiple domains, including physical function, telecommunication, social interactions, and other aspects of daily living, which could be a focus for goal-setting communication in the clinical setting. PROMIS PF SF10a may be a more effective and efficient scale to measure 4 sub-categories of daily activity limitations. To more comprehensively assess the spectrum of the impact of RA, it appears advisable to also use PROMIS Fatigue SF7a and APS SF4a to examine General tasks and demands, and Interpersonal interactions and relationships limitations.",3

However, NP-like features have been found in several chronic secondary musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions in the absence of detectable lesion or damage to the somatosensory pathways. Emerging evidence has demonstrated associations between NP-like symptoms and altered neural activity within brain regions implicated in sensory perception and affective-emotional processing of pain with consistent findings of abnormal activity in the right insula (RIns) cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG-NF) is a brain-computer interface biofeedback technique that allows individuals to self-regulate the real-time cortical brain activities of the regions of interest. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of a novel EEG-NF intervention designed to simultaneously downtrain activity in the RIns and dACC in individuals with a chronic secondary MSK pain condition exhibiting NP-like features. In addition, this study will conduct secondary exploratory analyses to investigate EEG-derived neuronal changes and their associations with clinical and experimental pain outcomes following the EEG-NF training. We will design a single-arm, open-label, pilot-feasibility trial. We will recruit adults aged 35-75 years with a score of ≥19 using the PainDETECT questionnaire and an average pain score of ≥4 on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the last 3 months, with a minimum pain duration of 3 months, to receive active EEG-NF training. Participants will receive auditory feedback as a reward for achieving a predetermined activity threshold of the RIns and dACC. Primary outcomes will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and safety using both self-reported questionnaires and monitoring data. Collected data will be summarized descriptively, with mean (SD) reported where appropriate. Secondary outcomes will include EEG parameters, self-reported measures, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing. An exploratory within-group pre-post statistical comparison will be conducted for all secondary outcome measures, and correlation analysis will be performed to explore relationships between EEG measures, self-reported outcomes, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing measures. This study has received approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Participant recruitment began in April 2025 and is ongoing. As of October 2025, data collection has been completed, with a total of 5 participants enrolled, all of whom have completed the study to date. We expect to complete the study in March 2026. This study will generate data on feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary data to inform a fully powered effectiveness clinical trial. The results and data generated will inform the design and sample size calculation for a fully powered randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of EEG-NF in targeting NP-like features in individuals with chronic MSK pain.

[PMID: 41187292] Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to poor outcomes after spinal deformity correction, but it is unclear whether osteoporosis is the underlying factor. This study analyzed a national administrative database to clarify this association. The 2010 to Q1 2022 PearlDiver M161 database was queried for adult spinal deformity surgeries. Patients were stratified by not having versus having vitamin D deficiency diagnosis and matched 4:1 based on age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and multivariate analysis (controlling for age, sex, and CCI) for 90-day postoperative adverse events was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs, Bonferroni correction, α < 0.00417). These methods were then repeated adding osteoporosis to the matching and multivariate controlling variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis comparing 5-year cumulative revision surgery rates was also performed for both sets of comparisons. In the primary analyses matching for age, sex, and CCI, the vitamin D deficiency cohort showed a higher likelihood of osteoporosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased odds of aggregated any (OR 1.34) and minor adverse events (1.39), as well as wound dehiscence (OR 1.91). The vitamin D deficiency group had a higher 5-year revision surgery rate (39.3% vs. 31.7%, P = 0.006).When osteoporosis was included as a matched/controlled variable, vitamin D deficiency was only associated with higher odds of aggregate any (OR 1.35) adverse events and urinary tract infection (OR 1.56). No difference in 5-year revision surgery rates was observed. Following adult deformity surgery, many of the perioperative adverse outcomes were similar regardless of controlling for osteoporosis, but 5-year revisions seemed to be driven by the osteoporosis rather than vitamin D deficiency.

[PMID: 41187098] Pain, both acute and chronic, places a substantial burden on global healthcare systems. While conventional treatments may be limited in efficacy due to side effects, risk of dependency, or variable individual response, there is growing interest in mind-body complementary approaches. Yoga Nidra (YGN) has emerged as a promising non-invasive intervention for pain management. However, a clear understanding of its efficacy remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of YGN on pain outcomes. A literature search was conducted across seven databases and one trial database. Eligible studies included quantitative designs assessing the effects of YGN on pain. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials and the modified Downs and Black checklist for non-randomized studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled effect sizes. Twelve studies, comprising 1,176 participants, were included. Between-group analyses revealed that YGN significantly reduced pain compared to passive comparators (Hedge's g: -2.05, p=0.01), while comparisons with active comparators (g: -0.31, p= 0.53) showed no statistically significant differences. Within-group analyses indicated significant pain reduction following YGN (g: -2.01, p<0.001). Subgroup comparisons of single versus multiple training sessions, as well as meta-regression analyses, revealed no significant dose-response relationship across intervention durations. YGN shows potential in reducing pain intensity compared to passive control conditions, with notable within-group improvements following intervention. However, given the low methodological quality across the included studies, these effects should be interpreted cautiously, as the observed effects may represent inflated estimates. Despite these limitations, YGN demonstrates potential as a complementary approach for pain management, underscoring the need for high-quality, standardized research to establish its efficacy as a viable clinical intervention.",3
