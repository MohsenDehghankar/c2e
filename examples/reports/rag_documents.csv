[PMID: 36839219] Increasingly, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming an inevitable consequence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. As the disease progresses, and through dialysis, the need for and loss of water-soluble vitamins both increase. This review article looks at the benefits and possible risks of supplementing these vitamins with the treatment of CKD. Data in the PubMed and Embase databases were analyzed. The keywords ""chronic kidney disease"", in various combinations, are associated with thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, folates, niacin, cobalamin, and vitamin C. This review focuses on the possible use of water-soluble vitamin supplementation to improve pharmacological responses and the overall clinical condition of patients. The mechanism of supportive supplementation is based on reducing oxidative stress, covering the increased demand and losses resulting from the treatment method. In the initial period of failure (G2-G3a), it does not require intervention, but later, especially in the case of inadequate nutrition, the inclusion of supplementation with folate and cobalamin may bring benefits. Such supplementation seems to be a necessity in patients with stage G4 or G5 (uremia). Conversely, the inclusion of additional B6 supplementation to reduce CV risk may be considered. At stage 3b and beyond (stages 4-5), the inclusion of niacin at a dose of 400-1000 mg, depending on the patient's tolerance, is required to lower the phosphate level. The inclusion of supplementation with thiamine and other water-soluble vitamins, especially in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients, is necessary for reducing dialysis losses. Allowing hemodialysis patients to take low doses of oral vitamin C effectively reduces erythropoietin dose requirements and improves anemia in functional iron-deficient patients. However, it should be considered that doses of B vitamins that are several times higher than the recommended dietary allowance of consumption may exacerbate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in CKD patients. Taking into account the research conducted so far, it seems that the use of vitamin supplementation in CKD patients may have a positive impact on the treatment process and maintaining a disease-free condition.

[PMID: 36757031] Cobalamin is an essential molecule for humans; it is exceptionally important for various body functions, including deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and cellular energy production. Vegans are more vulnerable to vitamin B12 deficiency than natives with moderate consumption of animal dietary supplements or people with inadequate nutritional patterns. However, the long-term effects of sub-medical deficiency have not been thoroughly studied, but they may have a negative impact on the cardiovascular system, pregnancy outcomes, and vascular, renal, cognitive, bone, and eye health. Alongside the statin remedy, that is a powerful approach for CVD prevention. Another approach is related to the B nutrition substitution remedy with folic acid, and vitamins B6 and B12 are extensively practised nowadays. There is a tremendous interest in plasma homocysteine (tHcy) as a cardiovascular hazard factor. However, current research in the field of its prevention is more inclined toward confirming the benefit of tHcy-reducing remedy with vitamin B12. Thus, while folic acid fortification is primarily aimed at reducing neural-tube defects, it may also play a significant role in the primary prevention of CVD by lowering tHcy. Folate and B-vitamins play important roles in CVD prevention and nutrition policy implementation. Patients affected with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or end-stage Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) experience a tremendous cardiovascular threat that may also further lead to death. As a result, routine monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is likely to be beneficial for the early detection and treatment of metabolic vitamin B12 deficiency, as well as the prevention of heart-related diseases.

[PMID: 31629573] In populations with folic acid fortification or supplementation, the main nutritional determinant of total homocysteine levels is vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (B12) status. We aimed to evaluate the modifying effect of B12 levels on the association between folic acid treatment and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. A post hoc analysis of an interventional trial. This is a post hoc analysis of 1,374 hypertensive adults with mild to moderate CKD and B12 measurements at baseline from the kidney disease substudy of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT), conducted in 20 communities in Jiangsu province in China, a region with low folate consumption. Assignments to a double-blinded daily treatment of enalapril, 10mg, and folic acid, 0.8mg; or enalapril, 10mg, alone. The primary outcome was progression of CKD (defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30% and to a level of<60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> if baseline eGFR was≥60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>; or a decrease in eGFR≥50% if baseline eGFR was<60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>; or kidney failure). Mean baseline eGFR in this study was 86.1±20.5 (SD) mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. Median treatment duration was 4.4 years. Among participants with higher baseline B12 levels (≥248pmol/L), compared to enalapril alone, enalapril-folic acid treatment was associated with an 83% reduction in the odds of the primary outcome (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.40). However, among those with baseline B12 levels<248pmol/L (metabolic B12 deficiency), there was no significant group difference in the primary outcome (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.51-2.85). The interaction between B12 level and folic acid treatment was significant (P = 0.001). The analysis is post hoc and event rate is low. Folic acid treatment was associated with a greater reduction in the odds of CKD progression among patients with mild to moderate CKD and higher B12 levels.

[PMID: 31550724] Although reduced red blood cell (RBC) lifespan has been reported to be a contributory factor to anemia in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), there are limited data regarding RBC lifespan in early-stage CKD. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) is considered a primary causative factor of renal anemia. The aims of this study were to compare the RBC lifespan, serum EPO levels, and other renal anemia indicators across CKD-stage groups of patients and to analyze the impacts of etiological factors on renal anemia. A cohort of 74 non-smoking patients with CKD were enrolled, including 15 in stage 1, 18 in stage 2, 15 in stage 3, 15 in stage 4, and 11 in stage 5. RBC lifespan was determined by CO breath tests. Potential correlations of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration with RBC lifespan, reticulocyte count (Ret), and levels of EPO, ferritin, folic acid, and vitamin B12 were analyzed. CKD progression was associated with decreases in (Hb) and RBC lifespan. RBC lifespan durations in CKD stages 1-5 were 122 ± 50, 112 ± 26, 90 ± 32, 88 ± 28, and 60 ± 24 days, respectively. RBC lifespan means for the stage 3, 4 and 5 groups were significantly shorter than those for the stage 1 and 2 groups. Serum EPO did not differ significantly between the CKD stage groups. (Hb) correlated directly with RBC lifespan (r = 0.372, p = 0.002) and Ret (r = 0.308, p = 0.011), but did not correlate with serum EPO, ferritin, folic acid, or vitamin B12 levels. Reduced RBC lifespan in early-stage CKD, demonstrated in this study, suggests that increased RBC destruction may play a more important etiological role in renal anemia than other indicators in patients with CKD.

[PMID: 31464252] A retrospective study was conducted over seven years and it aimed to find out various causes of anemia among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study included nondialysis-dependent adult CKD patients who underwent anemia evaluation. A total of 584 patients were studied. Three hundred and twenty-one (55%) patients were male and 263 (45%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 55.5 ± 14 years. One hundred and seventy-eight (30.5%) had a diabetic CKD and 406 (69.5%) had a nondiabetic CKD. Seventy-two (12.3%) patients were in CKD Stage 3, 193 (33%) patients in CKD Stage 4, and 319 (54.6%) patients in CKD Stage 5. The mean hemoglobin was 9.2 ± 2.2 g/dL. There was a progressive fall in hemoglobin with increasing severity of CKD and in CKD Stage 3, 4, and 5 the mean hemoglobin was 10 ± 2.2, 9.4 ± 2.1, and 8.4 ± 1.9 g/dL, respectively (P = 0.001). Most (47.4%) patients had moderate anemia followed by anemia of mild (31.4%) and severe (21.4%) degrees. Three hundred and seven (52.6%) patients had percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20% (functional iron deficiency). One hundred and sixty-two (27.7%) patients had serum ferritin <100 ng/mL (absolute iron deficiency); 334 (57.2%) patients had serum ferritin 100-500 ng/mL, but in 175 (52.4%) of them, TSAT was <20%; 88 (15.1%) patients had serum ferritin >500 ng/mL (58 (65.6%) were C-reactive protein (CRP) + and 55 (62.5%) had TSAT <20%). Overall, 392 (67.1%) patients had functional or absolute iron deficiency. One-third of the patients had elevated CRP levels. The anemia was macrocytic in 20.4% suggesting deficiency of folic acid and/or Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. A high proportion (74.6%) of patients with normocytic anemia had iron deficiency. In the majority of nondialysis-dependent CKD patients, the etiology of anemia may be multifactorial; therefore, the treatment should be determined by documented causes of anemia.

[PMID: 30781775] Patients affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) experience a huge cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular events represent the leading causes of death. Since traditional risk factors cannot fully explain such increased cardiovascular risk, interest in non-traditional risk factors, such as hyperhomocysteinemia and folic acid and vitamin B12 metabolism impairment, is growing. Although elevated homocysteine blood levels are often seen in patients with CKD and ESRD, whether hyperhomocysteinemia represents a reliable cardiovascular and mortality risk marker or a therapeutic target in this population is still unclear. In addition, folic acid and vitamin B12 could not only be mere cofactors in the homocysteine metabolism; they may have a direct action in determining tissue damage and cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this review was to highlight homocysteine, folic acid and vitamin B12 metabolism impairment in CKD and ESRD and to summarize available evidences on hyperhomocysteinemia, folic acid and vitamin B12 as cardiovascular risk markers, therapeutic target and risk factors for CKD progression.

[PMID: 29092063] Obesity is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hyperhomocysteinaemia refers to increased oxidative stress and has been associated with the risk of CKD. We investigated the association among body mass index (BMI), homocysteine level and impaired renal function in a Taiwanese adult population. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 24826 subjects who underwent a health check-up from January 2013 to December 2015. A multivariate linear regression model was developed to analyse the relationship among BMI, serum homocysteine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship among weight categories, hyperhomocysteinaemia and CKD. The prevalence of CKD in the quartile groups of homocysteine were 2.5%, 2.7%, 3.4% and 5.2% (P < 0.01). For every one-unit increase in BMI (kg/m2), the eGFR decreased by 0.50 ml/min/1.73 m2. Overweight/obese subjects with high homocysteine levels had a higher odds ratio (OR) for CKD, as compared with normal weight subjects (1.84 versus 1.38, respectively; P < 0.01 versus P = 0.02, respectively). Overweight/obese female subjects with hyperhomocysteinaemia had an OR of 3.40 [P < 0.01; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.06-5.61] for CKD; in males, the OR was 1.66 (P < 0.01; 95% CI: 1.38-1.99). Patients who are overweight/obese with higher homocysteine levels have an increased risk of CKD, especially females. Additional studies exploring whether the effect of weight loss or homocysteine-lowering therapies such as folic acid, vitamin B12 supplements that may prevent or slow the progression of declining renal function, is warranted.

[PMID: 26683908] Low vitamin D status has been implicated in several chronic medical conditions and unfavorable health outcomes. Our goal was to investigate whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels are a potentially modifiable risk factor for anemia in a nationally representative cohort of community-dwelling individuals in the United States. We performed a cross-sectional study of 5456 individuals (≥17 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2001 to 2006. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) was used to graphically depict the relationship between serum 25OHD levels and the cumulative frequency of anemia. Multivariable logistic regression models were then used to assess the independent association of 25OHD levels with anemia, while controlling for age, sex, race, body mass index, chronic kidney disease, as well as serum levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin, iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid. The mean (standard error) 25OHD and hemoglobin levels in the analytic group were 23.5 (0.4) ng/mL and 14.4 (0.1) g/dL, respectively. Prevalence of anemia was 3.9%. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing analysis demonstrated a near-linear relationship between vitamin D status and cumulative frequency of anemia up to 25OHD levels of approximately 20  ng/mL. With increasing 25OHD levels, the curve flattened out progressively. Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated an inverse association of 25OHD levels with the risk of anemia (adjusted odds ratio 0.97; 95% confidence interval 0.95-0.99 per 1  ng/mL change in 25OHD). Compared to individuals with ≥20  ng/mL, individuals with 25OHD levels <20  ng/mL were more likely to be anemic (adjusted odds ratio 1.64; 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.49). In a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling individuals in the United States, low 25OHD levels were associated with increased risk of anemia. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether optimizing vitamin D status can reduce the burden of anemia in the general population.",10
A breast cancer patient's capacity to metabolize tamoxifen influences treatment outcome.,breast cancer AND tamoxifen AND metabolism AND treatment outcomes,"41031251,40983817,40967344,40808956,40776023,40774834,40745642,40705465,40645971,40600576","[PMID: 41031251] <b>Background:</b> Tamoxifen resistance remains a major clinical challenge in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, contributing to recurrence and poor prognosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), including MALAT1, UCA1, CYTOR, GAS5, and HOTAIR, have emerged as key regulators of endocrine resistance. Curcumin, a polyphenol with anticancer properties, modulates lncRNA expression, and its bioavailable formulation, NanoCurcumin, enhances therapeutic efficacy. This study evaluates the effects of NanoCurcumin in combination with tamoxifen on lncRNA expression and resistance mechanisms in ER+ breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> Plasma levels of the selected lncRNAs were assessed via qRT-PCR in luminal breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen alone or in combination with NanoCurcumin oral soft gels for 6 months. Bioinformatics analysis of MALAT1 expression was performed using the GEO database. In vitro, MALAT1 expression was evaluated in breast cancer (MCF7) and normal breast (MCF10) cell lines via qRT-PCR. Tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells were generated through prolonged treatment, and the effects of NanoCurcumin on MALAT1 expression were analyzed over 4 months. <b>Results:</b> In clinical samples, NanoCurcumin significantly reduced MALAT1 expression (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and trended toward decreased UCA1, CYTOR, and HOTAIR while increasing GAS5 expression. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed MALAT1 upregulation in tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. In vitro, MALAT1 was significantly elevated in MCF7 cells compared to MCF10 and increased over time with tamoxifen treatment alone. NanoCurcumin reversed this trend, sustaining low MALAT1 levels and mitigating resistance. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that NanoCurcumin mitigates tamoxifen resistance by downregulating MALAT1, offering a novel epigenetic strategy to enhance endocrine therapy efficacy. Further studies should explore lncRNA-targeted interventions to improve treatment outcomes in ER+ breast cancer.

[PMID: 40983817] Hormone receptor-positive (HR +) and HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancers represent a biologically unique subset of breast malignancies characterized by the co-expression of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers exhibit distinct molecular features, often leading to aggressive growth and higher recurrence rates. HR+/HER2+ breast cancer cells can utilize estrogen and HER2-driven signaling pathways to promote proliferation, survival, and metastatic potential, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for treatment. The current therapeutic strategies focus on a combination of endocrine therapies, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., tamoxifen) or aromatase inhibitors, with HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, to concurrently inhibit both hormone and HER2-driven pathways. Despite initial treatment efficacy, resistance often develops through various mechanisms, including mutations in the PIK3CA gene, cross-talk between ER and HER2 signaling, and activation of alternative growth pathways. Ongoing research aims to improve patient outcomes by exploring novel combination therapies, including CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors, and by targeting resistance pathways. This review highlights the molecular basis, treatment approaches, and emerging therapeutic strategies in HR+/HER2+ breast cancer, emphasizing the need for personalized and adaptive treatment strategies in managing this complex disease subtype.

[PMID: 40967344] Breast cancer (BC) is a global health challenge, with approximately 75 % of cases classified as estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α)-positive luminal subtype. Although hormone therapies such as tamoxifen have improved outcomes, a subset of ER-α-positive BC patients develop resistance, resulting in early metastasis. Our research shows that ER-α loss is more frequent in distant metastases and is associated with poorer survival. We investigated the role of ER-α expression in BC progression, metastasis, and recurrence using comprehensive in vitro and in vivo models. Low ER-α expression in primary tumors was associated with increased metastasis and recurrence in ER-α-positive BC. Luminal BC cells with low ER-α expression exhibited increased invasiveness, whereas ER-α overexpression in triple-negative BC cells suppressed metastatic behavior. Mechanistically, ER-α downregulation promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and upregulated MMP9 expression in BC cells. These findings suggest that ER-α loss facilitates BC metastasis through the EMT process. Relatively low ER-α expression may serve as a potential prognostic indicator in ER-positive luminal BC. These results have potential implications for predicting outcomes in ER-positive BC and highlight the importance of personalized treatment strategies.

[PMID: 40808956] The development of acquired endocrine resistance and reduced chemosensitivity in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer presents significant challenges. Microtubule-based process-related genes (MBPRGs) play essential biological roles in the cell cycle and the development of migration. This study aimed to establish a novel prognostic signature based on MBPRGs to improve patient outcomes and offer additional treatment options for those with ER+ breast cancer. Clinical data along with relevant RNA information with ER+ breast cancer were sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium. Consensus clustering was subsequently utilised to identify new molecular subgroups. Evaluations of the tumour immune microenvironment and immune status of these subgroups were performed via ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, MCP, and ssGSEA. Additionally, functional analyses were conducted to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved. Prognostic risk models were developed via random forest, support vector machines and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. Single-cell analysis revealed differences in the expression levels of key genes among various cell types. Western blotting was used to measure protein levels in breast cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess protein expression in paraffin-embedded tissues, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to evaluate survival differences between the high- and low-expression groups of key genes. Transwell and cell viability assays were used to examine the biological functions of CHORDC1. Two molecular subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes were identified. Longer survival was linked to a high immune score, low tumour purity, a greater presence of immune infiltrating cells, and an overall positive immune status. Risk models derived from MBPRGs exhibited strong potential for predicting survival in patients with ER+ breast cancer. Key genes had elevated protein levels in differentiated breast cancer cell lines, and elevated CHORDC1 expression was linked to a tendency towards a worse outcome in patients with ER+ breast cancer. Silencing CHORDC1 inhibited cell viability and invasion, reducing sensitivity to tamoxifen and paclitaxel <i>in vitro</i>. MBPRG expression is linked to the immune microenvironment and drug resistance in ER+ breast cancer patients, providing a reliable prognostic indicator for this group.

[PMID: 40776023] Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is pivotal in personalized medicine, particularly in cancer care, where drug efficacy and toxicity often vary with genetic variability. This study investigates the prevalence of CYP2D6-related medications and phenotypes in a cohort of 5,576 female breast cancer patients using genomic and electronic health record (EHR) data from the NIH's All of Us Research Program. A total of 77% of patients were prescribed at least one CYP2D6 metabolized drug. A customized pipeline was developed to determine CYP2D6 genotypes and phenotypes, identifying actionable phenotypes in 12.5% of patients. The prevalence of CYP2D6-associated drugs, including Tamoxifen, ondansetron, and tramadol, were widely prescribed and increased significantly following cancer diagnosis. Approximately 25% of phenotyped patients exhibited non-normal metabolizer types, emphasizing the importance of pharmacogenomic considerations in clinical decision-making. These findings emphasize the potential of incorporating PGx guidelines into routine clinical practice to optimize breast cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes.

[PMID: 40774834] This study aims to assess the disease characteristics, practice patterns and real-world outcomes of patients (pts) with HR positive (+)/HER2 negative (-) early breast cancer (EBC) treated in Brazil's largest network of community oncology practices. Retrospective study from the Oncoclínicas&CO real-world database from 2016 to 2021. We assessed risk profile distribution (high-risk [HR], intermediate-risk [IR] or low-risk [LR]) as per recent adjuvant trials in EBC, endocrine and chemotherapy (CT) prescriptions and 3-year invasive disease-free survival (iDFS). In total, 1,786 cases were selected for the study. Median age was 57 years, 566 (32%) were premenopausal, 1,179 (66%) were LR, 351 (20%) IR, and 256 (14%) HR. In postmenopausal pts, aromatase inhibitor (AI) was used by 74% with LR, 79% with IR and 83% with HR. In premenopausal pts, ovarian function suppression (OFS) - combined with tamoxifen or AI - was prescribed to 18% LR pts, 15% IR, and 48% HR. CT was offered to 32%, 38%, and 73% of postmenopausal pts in LR, IR, and HR groups. In premenopausal pts, 55%, 57%, and 78% received CT in LR, IR, and HR groups. The 3-year iDFS was 86% (95% CI, 84%-89%) in LR population, 87% (82%-91%) in IR, and 72% (95% CI, 65%-81%) in HR. In this large real-world cohort of patients treated in a private setting in Brazil, most pts are diagnosed with low-risk EBC. We found that a significant proportion of premenopausal pts with high-risk EBC were not treated with OFS and did not receive CT.

[PMID: 40745642] Although the clinical outcome of ER + breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen after surgery is favorable, a proportion of patients experience recurrence or death due to disease progression. In this study, by integrating lipid metabolism gene expression and machine learning data, a prognostic model based on gene expression was developed using the TCGA-ER + BRCA dataset (N = 183) and validated with the GSE17705 (N = 298), GSE22219 (N = 134), GSE42568 (N = 70), and GSE58644 (N = 147) datasets. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the median risk score of the signature. Comparative analyses of survival, genomic features, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity were performed between these groups. Patients in the high-risk group had worse survival outcomes than those in the low-risk group. The five-year overall survival AUC of the model was 0.858, indicating good performance. High-risk patients were characterized by USH2A and KMT2C mutations, genomic amplification, and enriched JAK-STAT pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. Resting CD4 + memory T cells, activated mast cells, and myeloid dendritic cells were significantly enriched in the low-risk group, while M0 macrophages were enriched in the high-risk group. Single-cell sequencing analyses also revealed that the model was significantly associated with macrophages and the percentage of proliferating myeloid cells. The signature was also associated with sensitivity to multiple drugs. Cell-cell interaction difference analyses suggested that cancer-related signaling pathways, especially the SIRPα/CD47/IL6 pathway, were decreased in high-risk patients, but these samples exhibited increased SPP1 interactions. The signature captures lipid metabolic reprogramming and immunosuppression, providing a biomarker for prognosis and precision therapy in tamoxifen-treated ER + breast cancer.

[PMID: 40705465] BACKGROUNDEndocrine therapy (ET) with tamoxifen (TAM) or aromatase inhibitors (AI) is highly effective against hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive) early breast cancer (BC), but resistance remains a major challenge. The primary objectives of our study were to understand the underlying mechanisms of primary resistance and to identify potential biomarkers.METHODSWe selected more than 800 patients in 3 subcohorts (Discovery, n = 364, matched pairs; Validation 1, n = 270, Validation 2, n = 176) of the West German Study Group (WSG) ADAPT trial who underwent short-term preoperative TAM or AI treatment. Treatment response was assessed by immunohistochemical labeling of proliferating cells with Ki67 before and after ET. We performed comprehensive molecular profiling, including targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and DNA methylation analysis using EPIC arrays, on posttreatment tumor samples.RESULTSTP53 mutations were strongly associated with primary resistance to both TAM and AI. We identified distinct DNA methylation patterns in resistant tumors, suggesting alterations in key signaling pathways and tumor microenvironment composition. Based on these findings and patient age, we developed the Predictive Endocrine ResistanCe Index (PERCI). PERCI accurately stratified responders and nonresponders in both treatment groups in all 3 subcohorts and predicted progression-free survival in an external validation cohort and in the combined subcohorts.CONCLUSIONOur results highlight the potential of PERCI to guide personalized endocrine therapy and improve patient outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATIONWSG-ADAPT, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01779206, retrospectively registered 01-25-2013.FUNDINGGerman Cancer Aid (Grant Number 70112954), German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Grant Number 01ZZ1804C, DIFUTURE).

[PMID: 40645971] Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC), a distinct subtype of breast cancer, is hallmarked by E-Cadherin loss, slow proliferation, and strong hormone receptor positivity. ILC faces significant challenges in clinical management due to advanced stage at diagnosis, late recurrence, and development of resistance to endocrine therapy - a cornerstone of ILC treatment. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying endocrine resistance in ILC, ILC cell lines (MDA-MB-134-VI, SUM44PE) were generated to be resistant to tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. The tamoxifen-resistant (TAMR) cells exhibit a 2-fold increase in tamoxifen IC<sub>50</sub> relative to parental cells. Metabolomics and RNA-sequencing revealed deregulation of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, purine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism in TAMR cells. Among the fifteen commonly dysregulated genes in these pathways, low argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1) expression was identified in the TAMR cells and was significantly correlated with poor outcome in ILC patients, specifically in the context of endocrine therapy. Our study reveals methylation-mediated silencing of ASS1 in TAMR cells as a likely mechanism of downregulation. Demethylation restored ASS1 expression and correspondingly reduced tamoxifen IC<sub>50</sub> toward parental levels. Nucleic acid biosynthesis is augmented in TAMR cells, evidenced by an increase in nucleotide intermediates. Both TAMR cell lines demonstrated increased expression of several nucleic acid biosynthesis enzymes, including PAICS, PRPS1, ADSS2, CAD, and DHODH. Furthermore, CAD, the key multifunctional protein of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, is differentially activated in TAMR cells. Treating TAMR cells with Decitabine, a demethylating agent, or Farudodstat, a pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor, markedly augmented the efficacy of tamoxifen. Collectively, our study unveils ASS1 downregulation as a novel mechanism underlying acquired tamoxifen resistance in ILC and establishes a metabolic link between ASS1 and nucleic acid biosynthesis. Restoring ASS1 expression or inhibiting pyrimidine biosynthesis reinstated tamoxifen sensitivity. ASS1 could be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in tamoxifen-resistant ILC patients, warranting further investigation.

[PMID: 40600576] The clinical significance of individual CYP2D6 activity for the outcome of tamoxifen treatment in early breast cancer is unclear. Our previous investigation in patients diagnosed over the period 1998-2000 indicated an association between reduced CYP2D6 activity and poor outcome in premenopausal women. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between CYP2D6 genotype and clinical outcome in a larger tamoxifen treated cohort. Swedish breast cancer patients who initiated adjuvant tamoxifen treatment over the period 2006-2014 constituted the full study cohort. Clinical information was collected from medical records. Data on endocrine treatment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors was retrieved from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. CYP2D6 was genotyped and translated into predicted metabolic activity. The association between CYP2D6 activity and clinical outcome was analyzed using Cox regression, controlling for potential confounding variables. Subgroup analyses were performed based on menopausal status, tamoxifen treatment for at least 1 year and as single endocrine treatment, HER2-status and tamoxifen monotherapy. A total of 1,103 patients were included. A total of 761 patients received tamoxifen as monotherapy. A total of 42% were premenopausal. Median follow-up was 11.4 years. No significant association was found between CYP2D6 activity and recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.18, 95% CI 0.92; 1.52) or breast cancer mortality (aHR 1.41, 95%CI 0.93; 2.13) in the full cohort, or in the subgroup with tamoxifen monotherapy (aHR 1.39, CI 0.99; 1.96 and 1.88, CI 0.98; 3.60 respectively). No association was noted between reduced CYP2D6 activity and poorer outcome in this early breast cancer cohort, with patients generally at lower risk of recurrence, reflecting the role of adjuvant tamoxifen in current clinical practice.",10
A deficiency of folate increases blood levels of homocysteine.,folate deficiency AND homocysteine AND relationship AND homocysteine elevation,"41111878,40960431,40948861,40362647,40354985,40248447,40156756,39571660,39545031,39266685","[PMID: 41111878] Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare cause of stroke that may mimic other intracranial disorders. A 32-year-old male with bipolar disorder and prior venous thromboembolism presented with severe occipital headache, progressive blurred vision, and a brief sensory episode. He reported recent chronic nitrous oxide use. Imaging revealed extensive thrombosis of the superior sagittal, bilateral transverse, and sigmoid sinuses with venous congestion but no infarction. Laboratory studies showed markedly elevated homocysteine, elevated methylmalonic acid, and low vitamin B12 levels. He was treated with anticoagulation, parenteral vitamin B12, folic acid, and acetazolamide for suspected intracranial hypertension. Symptoms improved, and he was discharged for continued rehabilitation. This case underscores nitrous oxide-induced functional vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia as potential contributors to CVST, especially in younger patients without conventional risk factors. Early recognition, targeted metabolic correction, and cessation of exposure are essential to prevent complications and support recovery.

[PMID: 40960431] Folate and vitamin B12 are essential micronutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism. Deficiencies in these nutrients can elevate homocysteine levels, a recognized risk factor for hypertension. This study investigates the prevalence of folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies, hyperhomocysteinemia, and their association with hypertension in a North Indian population. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 1398 adult participants aged 30-75 years from rural Punjab, India. Biochemical parameters, including folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels, were assessed using the Chemiluminescence Immunoassay technique. Hypertension was defined as SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and DBP ≥ 90 mmHg or the use of antihypertensive medication. The findings revealed a sizable prevalence of folate (26.4%) and vitamin B12 (30.7%) deficiencies, along with a high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (64.8%). Homocysteine levels showed an inverse relationship with folate and vitamin B12 levels, though this association was evident only up to a specific threshold. Further, hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with prehypertension and hypertension, and low folate with prehypertension. Paradoxically, a positive correlation was observed between folate levels and blood pressure. These findings underscore the widespread prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia and their potential association with hypertension. The study also highlights the importance of establishing upper cutoff levels for folate and vitamin B12 to refine dietary and supplementation guidelines. The positive correlation between folate levels and blood pressure suggests potential interference with cellular nutrient uptake in hypertensive individuals, warranting further investigation.

[PMID: 40948861] Folic acid, an essential micronutrient in male reproductive physiology, serves as a critical cofactor in one-carbon metabolism by facilitating nucleotide biosynthesis and epigenetic methylation processes fundamental to spermatogenesis. Its metabolic role is characterized by two pivotal biochemical transformations: the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and the subsequent generation of S-adenosylmethionine. These reactions collectively sustain nucleic acid synthesis, preserve genomic integrity, and modulate transcriptional regulation in developing germ cells. Compromised folate status disrupts small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation and methylation patterns, resulting in impaired spliceosome complex formation and compromised pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing accuracy. Such molecular perturbations generate defective transcripts that ultimately undermine proteomic homeostasis during spermiogenesis. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that folate deficiency induces chromosomal segregation errors, mitotic spindle checkpoint dysfunction, and concurrent oxidative/endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways-all converging to manifest as teratozoospermia, diminished motility, and elevated sperm DNA fragmentation indices. Folic acid supplementation can improve snRNA and spliceosomal function, leading to improve semen parameters, particularly in individuals with polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes such as MTHFR. However, treatment efficacy exhibits dose-dependence, temporal dynamics, pharmacogenetic variation, and synergistic interactions with concurrent micronutrient administration, underscoring the imperative for personalized nutritional approaches. Emerging single-nucleus RNA sequencing technologies have elucidated intricate regulatory circuitry connecting folate-responsive snRNAs with mRNA processing, miRNA-mediated silencing, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)-mediated chromatin remodeling. These findings propose candidate molecular signatures for monitoring therapeutic response. Notwithstanding these advances, the mechanistic interplay between folate metabolism and snRNA processing machinery remains incompletely characterized, and evidence-based clinical protocols for infertility management remain undefined. Future research directions should encompass: (1) multi-omics integration (epigenomic-transcriptomic-proteomic); (2) pharmacogenomic-guided intervention trials; and (3) dynamic splicing efficiency quantification platforms. Such approaches will enable precision therapeutic stratification to maximize clinical outcomes while mitigating potential adverse effects. This critical synthesis delineates the mechanistic nexus between folate-dependent snRNA regulation, RNA splicing fidelity, and spermatogenic competence, while advocating for biomarker-driven, genotype-tailored therapeutic paradigms in folate-responsive male infertility.

[PMID: 40362647] Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been associated with disruptions in one-carbon metabolism and vitamin D pathways. Nutritional exposures-particularly vitamin D, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and homocysteine-may influence neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, a comprehensive, lifespan-spanning synthesis of these modifiable nutritional biomarkers has not been conducted. This systematic review and stratified meta-analysis critically synthesized data on vitamin D, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and homocysteine to elucidate their relationships with ASD risk and symptomatology. Our central question was: How do levels of vitamin D, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and homocysteine-measured before and after birth-affect the risk, severity, and potential treatment outcomes for ASD? We conducted a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) compliant systematic review and stratified meta-analysis (2015-2025) of 35 studies (11 randomized controlled trials, 24 observational), examining prenatal, neonatal, and postnatal biomarker levels. Eligibility criteria were defined using the PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study Design) framework to ensure scientific rigor and clinical relevance, including studies involving human participants aged 0-18 years with a formal Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis or prenatal exposures potentially linked to later ASD onset, while excluding animal studies, adult-only ASD populations, and studies lacking ASD cohorts or biomarker data. The search strategy, developed according to PRISMA, and Cochrane best practices, encompassed five major databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ProQuest) alongside manual searches of key references, grey literature, and clinical trial registries to ensure comprehensive retrieval of both published and unpublished studies. Study quality was assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs (RoB2) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies; certainty of evidence was graded via GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Random-effects meta-analyses were stratified by biomarker and study design. Heterogeneity, small-study effects, and publication bias were evaluated using Cochran's Q, I<sup>2</sup>, Egger's test, and trim-and-fill. Prenatal vitamin D deficiency was associated with approximately two-fold increased odds of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in offspring (pooled OR ≈ 2.0; <i>p</i> < 0.05), while excessively elevated maternal B<sub>12</sub> concentrations, often co-occurring with folate excess, were similarly linked to increased ASD risk. Meta-analytic comparisons revealed significantly lower circulating vitamin D (SMD ≈ -1.0; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and B<sub>12</sub> levels (SMD ≈ -0.7; <i>p</i> < 0.001), alongside elevated homocysteine (SMD ≈ 0.7; <i>p</i> < 0.001), in children with ASD versus neurotypical controls. Early-life vitamin D/B<sub>12</sub> insufficiency and elevated homocysteine are important, modifiable correlates of ASD risk and severity. Adequate maternal and child nutritional status could have risk-reducing and symptom-mitigating effects, although causality remains to be confirmed. This evidence supports tailored nutritional interventions as a component of ASD risk reduction and management strategies, within the bounds of overall developmental healthcare. The article processing charges (APC) were supported by ""Dunărea de Jos"" University of Galati, Romania. No external funding was received for the execution of the research. The review was not prospectively registered in PROSPERO or any other systematic review registry.

[PMID: 40354985] Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), one of the most common pregnancy complications, adversely affects maternal and fetal health. This study investigated the impact of vitamin D3 (VD3) deficiency or supplementation on placental long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) metabolism, one-carbon cycle metabolites, inflammation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and birth outcomes in a GDM rat model. Wistar rats were divided into five groups: Control (1000 IU VD3/kg diet), Vitamin D Deficient (VDD, 0 IU VD3/kg diet), GDM (1000 IU VD3/kg diet + GDM), VD3 supplementation with 1500 IU (VDS-1500 +GDM), and VD3 supplementation with 10,000 IU (VDS-10,000 +GDM). GDM was induced using a high-fat, high-sugar diet and streptozotocin. Diets were provided from weaning through pregnancy. Only the VDS-10,000 +GDM group achieved sufficient serum 25(OH)D levels (>30 ng/ml). 10,000 IU/kg VD3 supplementation reduced gestational weight gain and improved fetal/placental weight ratios. It reduced the levels of FBS, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR, while increased HOMA-IS. It regulated calcium homeostasis by decreasing parathyroid hormone and increasing phosphorous levels. It normalized one-carbon metabolites, reducing homocysteine and increasing folate levels. Both doses of VD3 supplementation mitigated oxidative stress, reducing malondialdehyde levels, which was higher in GDM and VDD groups. It restored LCPUFA profiles, increasing arachidonic acid and decreasing n-6 linoleic acid levels. High-dose VD3 reduced elevated plasma and placental TNF-α levels and downregulated IL-6 mRNA in the GDM group, while IL-6 protein levels remained comparable. The protein and mRNA levels of both VEGF and VEGF-R1 were higher in GDM group. 10,000 IU VD3 reduces VEGF levels whereas, 1500 IU VD3 reduces VEGF-R1 levels. High-dose VD3 supplementation (10,000 IU/kg) during pregnancy effectively improved vitamin D status and positively influenced placental metabolic pathways, oxidative stress, inflammation, and angiogenesis, thereby improving pregnancy outcomes in GDM.

[PMID: 40248447] Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) imposes a considerable impact on day-to-day functioning. Many people experience insufficient symptom relief even after taking the optimum dose of OCD medications. Reduced levels of folic acid and vitamin B₁₂, along with elevated homocysteine (HCY), have been suggested as possible factors in the persistence of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. This study investigated how supplementation of vitamin B₁₂, folic acid, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) affects OC symptoms and related biochemical markers. Methods A comparative study enrolled 72 OCD patients. For eight weeks, the conventional treatment group received SSRIs or other anti-obsessive medication. In contrast, the nutrient-supplemented group received supplements of vitamin B₁₂, folic acid, and SSRIs. Micronutrients HCY, folic acid, and vitamin B₁₂ were measured at baseline and after eight weeks. Besides, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was applied to assess the severity of OCD symptoms at the baseline, four-week, and eight-week visits. Results Group A (conventional treatment with nutrient supplement) showed significant improvements in vitamin B₁₂, blood folic acid, and reductions in HCY levels compared to Group B (conventional treatment). However, no substantial differences in insight levels were observed between the groups. Both groups exhibited decreased Y-BOCS scores, indicating a reduction in OCD symptoms; however, the improvements in Group A (conventional treatment + nutrient supplement) were statistically significant. Conclusions When taken with SSRIs, vitamin B₁₂and folic acid supplements seem to improve OCD patients' clinical results. These results imply that this supplementation could be a useful therapeutic adjunct.

[PMID: 40156756] Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by clinical heterogeneity and may be associated with cerebral folate deficiency (CFD). Among the causes, folate receptor alpha autoantibodies (FRAA) and variants of the SLC19A1 gene are commonly highlighted. The aim of this study was to analyze the rs1051266 variant of the SLC19A1 gene in patients with ASD and CFD and to determine its relationship with clinical and laboratory parameters. The study included 227 children with ASD, 156 of whom had CFD. FRAA detection, genotyping of the rs1051266 variant, and folate metabolism marker measurement (homocysteine, vitamins B9, B12, B6) were performed. FRAA binding was detected in 39.2% of ASD patients, blocking FRAA in 3.5%, and a specific soluble folate receptor in 13.2%. The 80GA genotype was the most common (46.3%), and homocysteine levels tended to be moderately elevated (upper quartile - 7.0). Significant correlations were found between homocysteine levels and vitamins B9, B12, and B6 (p < 0.05) and between verbal impairments and vitamin B12 (p = 0.043). In ASD and CFD patients, the 80GG genotype was more frequent (p = 0.03) and vitamin B12 levels were elevated (p = 0.021). In the ASD group, correlations were found between the 80AA genotype and demyelination (p = 0.020) and between homocysteine levels and demyelination (p = 0.042). In conclusion, the rs1051266 variant of the SLC19A1 gene modifies the clinical course of ASD. Patients with ASD and CFD exhibited high variability in folate metabolism markers. These findings underline the need for further research on folate transport genetics for personalized prevention and treatment strategies for ASD and CFD.

[PMID: 39571660] 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, MIM #607093) is a key enzyme in the folate cycle that catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF), a critical step for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease and the most common congenital defect in folate metabolism. A deficiency in MTHFR results in elevated serum homocysteine levels. In this study, we evaluated a patient diagnosed with epilepsy and elevated homocysteine levels, who carried compound heterozygous variants c.781-6G>A and c.1316T>C in the MTHFR gene. We primarily focused on the unreported non-canonical splicing variants c.781-6G>A in this patient and identified several complex splicing variant patterns. The c.1316T>C variant results in a substitution of leucine at position 439 with proline and this variant has been previously reported and is considered pathogenic. Our study mainly utilized RNA-seq and TA cloning to reveal the complex splicing patterns exhibited by this non-canonical splicing variant. Additionally, this finding was confirmed through in vitro experiments. This provided deeper insights into the underlying reasons for the patient's disease manifestation. Furthermore, despite apparently normal circulating folate and vitamin B12, we found two family members to exhibit mildly elevated homocysteine levels. While these individuals did not present overt clinical symptoms, the potential harm associated with high homocysteine levels should not be overlooked. This study not only provides additional genetic evidence for the clinical diagnosis of the patient but also broadens our understanding of the clinical manifestations of MTHFR deficiency.

[PMID: 39545031] the relationship between elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) and stroke has been established, but this association remains indistinct in cryptogenic stroke in adults. Our aim is to investigate the association between homocysteine, vitamins B9 and B12, and cryptogenic stroke. Furthermore, to determine the correlation between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism and biochemical levels in plasma. we conducted a retrospective case-control study including 100 cryptogenic stroke patients aged 18-50 years and 100 participants with age-and-sex-matched healthy controls. Clinical, radiological, and outcome data from cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) patients were recorded. Homocysteine, vitamin B9, and vitamin B12 were analyzed. Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) from both groups were tested. MTHFR C677T mutation was assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR). All analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSSV.20) software. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with stroke risk and clinical outcomes. a total of 200 cases were included in this study, 50% (n=100) patients with cryptogenic stroke (mean age of 40.49 ± 6.2 years, sex-ratio= 1.5) and 50% (n=100) healthy cases (mean age of 39.09 ± 5.8 years, sex-ratio= 1.5). The elevated plasma level of Hcy and vitamin B9 levels deficiency increase the risk of cryptogenic stroke occurrence (aOR: 2.5; 95% (0.71-5.25), P=0.01), (aOR: 3.1; 95% (1.6-9.6), p=0.02 respectively). Additionally, vitamin B9 deficiency was significantly associated with elevated Hcy levels (4.57 ± 3.59; p=0.001). Genetic analysis revealed a significant association between homozygous TT genotype of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, elevated Hcy levels (20.4 ± 7.07; p=0.001) and vitamin B9 deficiency (4.9±3.9; p=0.001). Furthermore, the combined CT/AC genotype was associated with elevated Hcy level (21.6 ± 9.6; p=0.001) and vitamin B9 deficiency (2.9 ± 1.0; p=0.04). the presence of homozygote MTHFR C677T or dual heterozygous MTHFR C66T and A1298C, which leads to elevated Hcy and deficiency of vitamin B9 plasma levels, is correlated with an increased risk of cryptogenic stroke occurrence among adult Tunisian patients.

[PMID: 39266685] To explore the relationship between serum folic acid (FA) or Vitamin B12 (VB12) and elevated BP in children and adolescents. Both a nested case control and a cohort study were designed to explore the relationship between serum folic acid (FA) or Vitamin B12 (VB12) and elevated blood pressure (BP). All the included participants were from primary school. A total of 326 subjects (116:210) in nested case control were from an established cohort. And 270 participants without hypertension at baseline and followed in 2019 in cohort. FA and VB12 levels were lower in the elevated BP group than in the control group, and homocysteine level was higher than that in the control group. In the elevated BP group, overweight/obese children had lower FA than overweight/obese children in the normal BP group. FA was positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and Apo lipoprotein A (APOA), but negatively correlated with triglyceride (TG). FA was significantly correlated with elevated BP in children and adolescents (β = -0.353, P = 0.032), after adjusting VB12, and homocysteine (HCY), and the interaction effect of FA*HCY was significant. Both systolic and diastolic BP levels were statistically lower in the FA high exposure group than in the FA low exposure group in the cohort study. This study found that FA and vitamin B12 deficiency in childhood was correlated with elevated BP levels, which may affect BP by regulating lipid levels, and confirmed the importance of maintaining high levels of FA and vitamin B12 in childhood either by diet or supplementation.",10

Oxidative stress (OS) is one of the culprits of DOR. By imposing OS damage on various kinds of ovarian cells including granulosa cells, OS can result in ovarian hypofunction and eventually lead to female infertility. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated yet. In this study, HIGD1A, a mitochondrial inner membrane component, is found to be downregulated in granulosa cells upon OS exposure. By systematically studying the role of HIGD1A in regulating granulosa cell and ovarian functions as well as its corresponding mechanisms, a novel regulatory mechanism underlying OS-related female infertility is revealed, and provided a potential molecular target for anti-OS therapies.

[PMID: 40801036] This study compared pregnancy outcomes after frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) in infertile women aged <40 years with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) versus normal ovarian reserve (NOR), incorporating exploratory analysis of potential endometrial aging factors. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the data of 1,362 patients aged <40 years who underwent FET between January and December 2024. Patients were categorized into two groups: the DOR (anti-Müllerian hormone [AMH] < 1.1 ng/mL, n = 136) and NOR (AMH ≥ 1.1 ng/mL, n = 1,226) groups. Pregnancy outcomes were compared after adjusting for confounding factors using inverse probability weighting. Additionally, exploratory immunohistochemical analysis of p16 expression was performed using endometrial samples from 16 patients (n = 8 per group). After weighting, the clinical pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the DOR group than in the NOR group (47.0% vs. 58.3%, P = 0.040; odds ratio = 0.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.98). Exploratory analysis revealed that the expression of p16 was significantly higher in the endometrial cells of patients with DOR than in those of patients in the NOR group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, a trend toward lower clinical pregnancy rates was observed with higher p16 expression. These exploratory findings suggest that reduced pregnancy rates in young women with DOR may involve endometrial aging mechanisms; however, the preliminary nature and limited sample size for molecular analysis necessitate cautious interpretation and warrant validation in larger and well-controlled cohorts.

[PMID: 40773998] The Yangluan Formula (YLF) influences the outcomes of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in infertile women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR); however, the potential mechanisms by which YLF ameliorates DOR have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of YLF on IVF-ET outcomes in infertile women with DOR, and to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which YLF addresses DOR. Non-targeted metabolomics studies were conducted on follicular fluid specimens procured from individuals with DOR treated with or without YLF, and from patients with normal ovarian reserve who underwent IVF-ET treatment. Distinct metabolites were identified using untargeted metabolomics, and MetaboAnalyst was used to examine metabolic pathways. After applying network pharmacology (NP), the target of YLF acting on DOR was determined. Cytoscape software was used to develop compound-reaction-enzyme-gene networks, and molecular docking (MD) simulations were conducted to confirm the link between YLF and crucial targets. Patients with DOR showed a notable reduction in the number of oocytes retrieved, incidence of 2PN fertilization, and number of cleaved embryos (P < 0.001). Additionally, the DOR cohort exhibited a markedly reduced quantity of high-quality embryos on day 3 compared to the CON cohort (P < 0.005). In contrast to the DOR cohort, the YLF cohort exhibited notably superior outcomes in terms of 2PN fertilization rates, cleavage-stage embryo development, and the number of high-grade embryos on day 3 (P < 0.05). The proportion of 2PN fertilization observed in YLF subjects substantially exceeded that in DOR individuals (81.2 % vs. 64.3 %, P < 0.05). Combined analysis of metabolomics and NP, focusing on five key targets for the action of YLF (monoamine oxidase A, monoamine oxidase B, myeloperoxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and phosphodiesterase 3A), four key metabolites (pelargonic acid, 1-(5-Phospho-D-ribosyl)-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxylate, isokobusone, 5-O-(1-Carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate), and two related pathways (glycine, serine, alanine, and threonine metabolism). We elucidated the mode of action of YLF in DOR treatment by integrating metabolomics and NP. YLF can effectively improve IVF outcomes in patients with DOR. This study provides new perspectives on the mechanism by which YLF improves ovarian function.

[PMID: 40725960] Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is characterized by reduced ovarian follicle quantity and quality, contributing to female infertility. While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is commonly used, its efficacy is limited and associated with adverse effects. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), using multi-target herbal formulations that may support ovarian function through endocrine modulation and microcirculatory improvement, has shown promise in improving ovarian function, though high-quality clinical evidence remains scarce. This study evaluates the efficacy of the Bushen Huoxue Formula in treating DOR and to identify predictors of treatment response. This retrospective cohort study included 122 DOR patients allocated to 3 groups: HRT (n = 32), combined HRT and TCM (n = 32), and TCM alone (n = 58). The primary outcome was the change in anti-Müllerian hormone (ΔAMH) levels after 3 months. Nonparametric tests assessed intergroup differences. Spearman correlation and a generalized linear model were used to evaluate associations between baseline factors and ΔAMH. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, AMH level, and parity. Compared with the HRT group, both the TCM and combined groups showed significantly greater AMH improvements (generalized linear model: B = 0.300 and 0.270, respectively; both P < .001). Parity was a negative predictor of ΔAMH (B=-0.123, P = .009), while age, baseline AMH, and T4 were not independently associated. Subgroup analyses showed greater treatment effects in patients < 40 years, nulliparous, and with baseline AMH > 0.2 ng/mL (P = .007-<0.001). Bushen Huoxue Formula, either alone or combined with HRT, significantly improves AMH in DOR patients, particularly in younger, nulliparous women with moderate ovarian reserve. These findings support the use of TCM as a potential strategy to enhance ovarian function.

[PMID: 40691107] A growing body of evidence demonstrates that androgens play crucial roles in female reproductive physiology. Androgen receptor (AR) expression appears at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and other female reproductive organ or tissue such as uterus, placenta and immune system. Via AR-mediated mechanisms, androgens regulate key reproductive processes including follicular development, embryo implantation, placental formation, and pregnancy maintenance. AR knockout models suffer from considerable reproductive defects characterized by defective follicular development, reduced ovulation, decreased fertility, even premature ovarian failure. Clinically, low maternal serum testosterone correlates with diminished ovarian reserve and adverse pregnancy outcomes. These findings establish that a critical threshold of androgen is essential for successful pregnancy. While androgen excess has long been associated with follicular dysfunction and endometrial abnormalities leading to infertility and miscarriage, emerging evidence indicates that insufficient androgen similarly compromise female reproductive function. This review synthesizes fundamental discoveries and clinical evidence elucidating androgen's multifaceted effects on female reproduction. Collectively, we underscore the physiological significance of optimal androgen signaling and the pathological consequences from androgen deficiency across reproductive process.

[PMID: 40683607] Ovarian aging is a major determinant of female reproductive longevity, characterized by declining oocyte quality and reduced ovarian reserve. With more women delaying childbearing, age-related infertility has become an urgent biomedical concern. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in this process, leading to oxidative damage and metabolic disturbances that impair oocyte competence. These alterations are linked to poorer outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART), particularly for women over 35, who face significantly reduced success rates. This review examines the key mechanisms of ovarian aging, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, telomere shortening, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all contributing to diminished oocyte quality and quantity. Special focus is given to sirtuins, especially SIRT1 and SIRT3, as critical regulators of redox balance in oocytes and granulosa cells. The review also addresses the impact of age-related changes on chromosomal cohesion and ovarian fibrosis. Importantly, mitochondrial insufficiency is increasingly recognized as a factor in broader age-related diseases, such as metabolic disorders and cancer, suggesting shared molecular pathways between reproductive aging and systemic health. Recent advances highlight the potential of targeted nutrient supplementation to modulate redox homeostasis, enhance sirtuin activity, and preserve mitochondrial function-strategies that may benefit both ovarian health and overall aging. This intersection of reproductive biology and mitochondrial medicine is driving interest in pharmacologic interventions to improve oocyte quality and mitigate age-related comorbidities.

[PMID: 40611296] Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), a common female disease, results in reduced fertility and menstrual disorders. Patients without timely treatment often suffer from infertility, ovarian insufficiency, premature ovarian failure and early onset or worsened perimenopausal symptoms caused by estrogen fluctuation or deficiency. However, there is a lack of effective methods to improve ovarian reserve function. Here, we report a case of a 13-year-old female with 2-year menstrual disorder. The anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels were test twice, with interval of 2 months, yielding results of 0.41 ng/mL and 0.50 ng/mL, respectively. Colour Doppler ultrasound examination showed that there were 4-6 antral follicles bilaterally. The patient was diagnosed with DOR. She was treated with Heyan Kuntai capsule (HYKT) combined with hormonal therapy (HT). Post treament, her AMH level, follicle stimulating hormone level and AFC normalized. Discontinuation of HYKT and continuation of HT alone for 5 months proved ineffective. Consequently, HYKT in combination with HT was continued, leading to normal ovarian reserve function restoration. No adverse reactions were observed during the 4-year follow-up. This case highlights the importance of including DOR as a diagnostic consideration in adolescents with menstrual disorders during clinical evaluation. AND combining HYKT with HT might contribute to potential improvements in ovarian function in DOR patients.

[PMID: 40507534] The assessment of the ovarian reserve is important in patients with fertility intent. The anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) serum level is a useful ovarian reserve marker. Endometriosis is a benign disease with three phenotypes: superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SUP), ovarian endometrioma (OMA), and deep endometriosis (DE). Endometriosis is linked with infertility; however, the exact impact of endometriosis and endometriosis surgery on AMH levels is less clear. This narrative review examines how different endometriosis phenotypes and related surgeries affect AMH levels as well as explores whether pre- and post-surgical AMH can predict the reproductive outcomes in women seeking pregnancy. The evidence suggests that OMA is linked to reduced AMH values and a higher AMH decline rate over time. OMA cystectomy causes further a reduction in AMH, which, however, tends to recover postoperatively. Non-excisional surgery for OMA spares the ovarian parenchyma; however, an at least temporary decline in AMH is observed. The effect is likely smaller than that of cystectomy. Non-thermal methods of hemostasis following cystectomy are likely superior in terms of AMH. The AMH levels before OMA cystectomy appear to be positively correlated with the postoperative probability of pregnancy, particularly spontaneous conception, but not livebirth rates. Preoperative AMH levels are also predictive of the risk of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Similarly, postoperative AMH levels and the rate of AMH decline at 1 year after OMA cystectomy appear to be predictive of fertility outcomes. SUP likely has little (if any) impact on AMH levels. DE reduces AMH levels, and a further reduction following surgery is anticipated. However, a reduction in AMH values should not be interpreted as a decline in the patient's reproductive potential. Further research should focus on the extra-ovarian locations of endometriosis and their impact on AMH values.

[PMID: 40147551] Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is a major cause of infertility, often triggered by inflammation and oxidative stress. Pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, has been implicated in DOR pathogenesis. Itaconic acid (IA), an endogenous metabolite, is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to explore whether IA could alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced DOR in mice by inhibiting pyroptosis through the NRF2 pathway. A DOR mouse model was established by administering LPS for 5 consecutive days, followed by IA treatment. Ovarian function was assessed by follicle count and hormone levels. Inflammatory markers, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis-related proteins were evaluated in both in vivo and in vitro models. The molecular mechanism was further investigated using inhibitors and molecular docking studies. IA significantly improved ovarian function in LPS-induced DOR mice by increasing the number of follicles and normalizing hormone levels. IA also reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis, as evidenced by lower expression of NLRP3, cleaved-caspase-1, and N-GSDMD, while increasing NRF2 expression. In vitro, IA enhanced granulosa cell (GC) viability, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), and decreased pyroptosis in LPS-treated GCs. Additionally, the beneficial effects of IA were mediated via the NRF2 pathway, as NRF2 inhibition (ML385) reversed these improvements. Additionally, we identified GSDMD as a downstream target of IA, with inhibition of GSDMD ameliorating DOR progression and inflammatory responses. IA alleviates LPS-induced DOR by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis through activation of the NRF2 signaling and direct inhibition of the GSDMD pathway. These findings suggest that IA may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for improving ovarian reserve and fertility.

[PMID: 40108995] Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is a pathological condition characterised by reduced ovarian function, which refers to the decreased quality and quantity of oocytes, potentially causing female infertility and various health issues. Follicular fluid (FF) serves as the microenvironment for follicular development and oocyte maturation, gaining an in-depth understanding of the metabolic state of FF will help us uncover the key biological processes involved in ovarian aging, while the specific underlying pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we utilised pseudotargeted metabolomic analysis of FF to reveal the glycerophospholipid metabolism dysfunction mediated by GPD1L in DOR patients. We also found that GPD1L was downregulated in granulosa cells (GCs) of DOR patients, resulting in increased cell apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, our results demonstrated that the downregulated expression of GPD1L could induce follicular atresia and impair oocyte quality in mouse ovaries. Altogether, our research suggested that GPD1L in GCs and the key metabolites in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway could potentially act as novel biomarkers of DOR diagnosis, paving the way for a new theoretical basis for understanding the pathogenesis of DOR.",10

The effects of such extended aggregation of doses form an important part of the everyday concerns of radiological protection against low-level exposures. For more than half a century, databases of nuclear workers have been assembled, and the numbers of workers currently included in studies, together with the numbers of deaths among them that have now occurred, are capable of generating reasonably precise risk estimates that should provide meaningful comparisons with those obtained from other studies, such as of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, constructing, updating and maintaining these large databases, linking workers to occupational dose databases and to registers of deaths (and other outcomes, such as incident cancers) and their causes, and analyses of these data that endeavour to take account of other influential factors (such as smoking) are far from straightforward. A critical review of recent nuclear worker studies illustrates the difficulties in reliably interpreting reported statistical associations between rates of cancer and cumulative occupational doses because of the real possibility of distortions produced by biases, confounding and/or the interplay of radiation with other risk factors. This doesn't mean that studies of nuclear workers should be abandoned, far from it, but it does mean that appropriate effort needs to be expended on these studies before confident conclusions about the levels of risks from radiation exposure can be drawn from them. Unexpected findings should be examined in depth to gain a proper understanding of their origin, including the impact of doses from intakes of radionuclides upon dose-responses derived using doses from external sources of radiation.

[PMID: 41187335] DNA nanostructure-enabled functional constructs have shown potential to improve healthcare outcomes by offering advanced disease diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Translating this potential of DNA nanostructure-based constructs to real life applications relies on maintaining and enhancing the structural integrity and functions of the surface-anchored moieties. In this study, we explored the possibility of utilizing choline dihydrogen phosphate (CDHP) solution, an aqueous solution of ionic liquid, to assemble DNA nanostructures of different sizes and complexities with enhanced biostability and ligand binding affinity. We show successful formation of the DNA nanostructures in aqueous CDHP solution using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and circular dichroism (CD). Biostability assays reveal that the aqueous CDHP solution may provide passive protection to DNA nanostructures against DNase I and human serum for up to 48 h. We also demonstrate that this enhanced biostability arises both from the structural conformation imparted during CDHP-mediated folding and from the presence of free CDHP ions in the solution. Notably, removal of free ions reduced the passive protection effect, but did not eliminate it, indicating the contribution of both folding and surrounding free ions. Using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we show that the presence of aqueous CDHP solution can enhance the binding of aptamer-functionalized DNA nanostructures to specific receptors on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Our strategy of using ionic liquid solution for one-pot preparation with enhanced stability and functionality offers a robust, simpler and faster alternative for DNA nanostructure-based constructs.

[PMID: 41187318] Synchronous oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a unique clinical entity with potential benefit from radical local consolidative therapy (LCT). However, robust tools to stratify patients most likely to benefit from radical LCT are lacking. We identified patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC from the SEER 17 registry (2018-2021). Radical LCT was defined as surgical resection of the primary tumor (±metastasectomy) and/or radiotherapy. Patients were stratified accordingly. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox models with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding. A weighted random survival forest (RSF) model and SHAP analysis were applied to capture nonlinear interactions and key prognostic determinants. Model discrimination was assessed by C-index, AUC, and integrated Brier score (IBS). Among 5,377 patients, 221 received radical LCT. The radical LCT group was younger, had earlier T stage, smaller tumors, and more frequent brain metastases. Median overall survival (mOS) was significantly longer in the radical LCT group than the no-LCT group (27 vs. 7 months; p<0.001), with maximal benefit among those also receiving chemotherapy (mOS: 30 months). The RSF model outperformed Cox regression in training (C-index: 0.752 vs. 0.735) with similar validation results. Chemotherapy (HR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.36-0.46; p<0.001) and radical LCT (HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.91; p = 0.018) were independent favorable factors. SHAP analysis demonstrated that radical LCT and chemotherapy contributed most to risk reduction in the survival prediction model, with consistent protective effects observed across different age, T stage, and histological subgroups. This multi-center, population-based study is the first to establish and internally validate a machine learning-based risk stratification tool for patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC. Radical LCT, particularly when combined with chemotherapy, was associated with improved OS in this cohort. The model may facilitate preliminary risk stratification and assist multidisciplinary management, but external validation and integration of key clinical and molecular variables are needed before clinical application. Prospective multicenter validation is warranted.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187246] Adult female acne presents challenges, including increased prevalence, distinct clinical manifestations, heightened skin sensitivity, treatment-related intolerance, and reduced treatment adherence. Integrating skincare into acne management is essential, particularly in Nordic European countries, where environmental factors influence skin physiology. The Nordic European Countries Acne Skincare Algorithm (NECASA) II algorithm serves as an evidence-based practical tool for clinicians in this region to select appropriate skincare based on individual patients' needs to optimize acne care for adult females. Dermatologists from six Nordic European countries met to develop the NECASA II algorithm, which builds on the NECASA I framework. The advisors conducted a structured literature review and, combined with their clinical experience, established best practice recommendations for integrating skincare into adult female acne treatment regimens. The NECASA II algorithm recommends integrating skincare into adult female acne management based on acne severity, subtype, and patient characteristics. The panel concluded that all acne regimens should incorporate a physiologic pH cleanser, an emollient with humectants and lipids, and SPF 50+ sunscreen. Skincare monotherapy is recommended for mild acne, adjunctive skincare for moderate-to-severe acne, and maintenance skincare to prevent relapse following treatment. Personalized skincare regimens, combined with prescription and nonprescription treatments, can mitigate adverse effects, improve treatment tolerance and adherence, and enhance overall outcomes.

[PMID: 41187244] The objective of this survey was to obtain feedback and insights from United States dermatology healthcare professionals on their perceptions of sunscreens. This cross-sectional survey study launched online via the Dermsquared&reg; platform to US dermatology healthcare professionals (HCPs) comprised questions evaluating perceptions of sunscreen (eg, formulation, usage, active safety and efficacy, misinformation, and perceptions on sunscreen access). ""Strongly agree"" and ""agree"" responses were analyzed together and ""strongly disagree"" and ""disagree"" responses were analyzed together. The relationships between groups were evaluated using the chi-square test of independence (P&lt;0.05). A total of 723 HCPs were surveyed. Most (98%) agreed that the ""best sunscreen is the one that patients will consistently use."" Significantly more dermatologists than physician assistants and nurse practitioners (P&lt;0.05) agreed with this, and 99% of HCPs agreed that sunscreen helps lower skin cancer risk. Most HCPs (99%) agreed that sunscreens offering a better application and aesthetic experience are likely to be used by patients more often. Significantly more HCPs agreed that chemical/organic actives offer a better application experience than physical/inorganic actives compared with those who responded neutral or disagreed, and most HCPs agreed that both sunscreen types were safe and effective. Social media and social media influencers were believed to be the greatest source of misinformation for patients. The dermatology HCPs in this survey strongly support sunscreen use and believe that FDA-approved sunscreens are effective and safe. The social media findings highlight a continued need to improve education on sunscreen use and increase counseling from clinicians on sun protection behaviors.

[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187209] Anemia remains a critical public health issue, especially in low-resource settings like Uganda, with severe consequences especially in HIV-positive children. Limited research has been conducted in low-income settings especially about anaemia in HIV-Positive children. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with anemia among HIV positive children at Kayunga Regional Referral Hospital. In addition to assess iron deficiency anemia using Mentzer index. This was a hospital based cross-sectional study conducted at KRRH. 384 HIV-positive children aged 6 months to 12 years attended the KRRH ART clinic between November 2024 to January 2025 were enrolled.Data was collected using structured questionnaires,information regarding their sociodemographic, medical and laboratory was obtained asking care giver or reviewing the medical record. Anthropometric measurements were done and interpreted compared to the WHO z-scores and obtained blood sample for CBC and analyzed. Anemia was defined based on age-specific hemoglobin thresholds: < 11.0 g/dL for children aged 6-59 months, < 11.5 g/dL for those aged 5-11 years, and <12.0 g/dL for children aged 12-14 years. Iron deficiency anemia was diagnosed with MI > 13. Logistic regression in STATA was done to determine the factors that were significantly associated with anaemia. Majority of the children (63.5%) were over 5 years of age and 52.9% were male and 57.3% had anemia with 95% confidence interval of 52.3-62.2%. The predominant severity category of anemia was moderate (48.6%). Multivariable analysis showed that caretakers who stopped in primary, having more than four siblings, being in current HIV stages 2 or 3, any history of hospital admission in the preceding six months, and being severely stunted, wasted, or experiencing concurrent stunting and wasting were independently associated with anemia among children infected with HIV (P-value < 0.05 for all). Iron deficiency anemia accounted for 54.1% of all children with anemia.

[PMID: 41187208] This study reports the first green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using an aqueous leaf extract of Brownlowia tersa (B. tersa), confirming their formation via UV-Vis spectrophotometry with a peak at 472 nm. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial and neuroprotective activities, particularly for Alzheimer's disease. GC-MS and FT-IR analyses identified phenolics and flavonoids as the capping and reducing agents in the synthesis process. FESEM imaging showed nanoparticles of varied shapes and sizes, while EDX analysis confirmed the presence of silver, oxygen, and carbon. The antimicrobial activity was demonstrated with inhibition zones ranging from 8.5 to 10.5 mm against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 100 and 200 μg/disc, compared to control, deionised water. In antioxidant assays, AgNPs exhibited an IC₅₀ of 1533.448 μg/ml, significantly higher than L-ascorbic acid (IC₅₀: 83.948 μg/ml) and the plant extract (IC₅₀: 254.438 μg/ml), indicating weaker antioxidant properties of AgNPs. The cytotoxicity of the AgNPs was assessed using the brine shrimp lethality test, yielding LC₅₀ value of 13.50 μg/ml, indicating moderate toxicity. Neuropharmacological tests, except the elevated plus maze, on swiss albino mice revealed significant anxiolytic effects (p < 0.05) and enhanced locomotor activity. Molecular docking studies of bioactive compounds from B. tersa leaves with Alzheimer's and bacterial infection-related proteins revealed binding energies from -7.7 to -5.2 kcal/mol, with Benzamide, N-ethyl-N-[(4-ethylaminophenyl) sulfonyl]- and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol showing the strongest affinities. While the results are promising, the study acknowledges challenges in scaling up the synthesis process and emphasises the need for further research into the long-term biological effects and safety of AgNPs. Overall, B. tersa-derived AgNPs show great potential for therapeutic applications in bacterial infections and neurological disorders, but scalability and safety require more investigation.

[PMID: 41187205] Dopamine is known to play a role in the development of myopia. In this study, we investigated the effect of dopamine (DA) on the secretion of transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Additionally, we examined the effects of SCH23390 (D1 receptor antagonist) and sulpiride (D2 receptor antagonist) on TGF-β2 levels in ARPE-19 cells to elucidate the underlying mechanism of DA in myopia development. Human RPE cells were cultured with or without different concentrations of DA, SCH23390, or sulpiride. Cell proliferation was examined using the CCK-8 assay. Cell migration was assessed by performing a cell scratch (wound healing) assay. The expression of TGF-β2 was evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Furthermore, the secretion of TGF-β2 into the ARPE-19 cell supernatant was quantified using ELISA. Treatment with 20 μg/mL of DA significantly increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA and protein expression levels of DRD1, DRD2, YAP, and TEAD and decreased TGF-β2 levels compared with that in control group. However, treatment with 24 μg/mL of SCH23390 for 24 h significantly decreased (P < 0.05) DRD1 and TGF-β2 mRNA expression and increased DRD2, YAP, and TEAD mRNA expression in ARPE-19 cells compared with that in the control group. Additionally, the protein expression levels of TGF-β2, YAP, TEAD, and SMAD7 were consistent with the mRNA levels. Notably, treatment with sulpiride (14 μg/mL) increased (P < 0.05) DRD1 and TGF-β2 expression and decreased DRD2, YAP, and TEAD expression in the cells at both the mRNA and protein levels compared with that in the control group. Our findings suggest that dopamine suppresses TGF-β2 secretion in human retinal pigment epithelial cells primarily through activation of D2 receptors, which appears to involve the YAP-TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway. This regulatory mechanism may contribute to the control of scleral remodeling and thus influence the development of myopia.",10

The major characteristics of MODY include not having insulin resistance and the absence of autoimmunity, early onset, and a family history suggesting autosomal-dominant inheritance. Nonetheless, genetic testing is necessary for diagnosis. The MODY-related genes CEL, ABCC8, PDX1, GCK, WFS1, HNF4A, HNF1A, and HNF1B were examined using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in this investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic and clinical characteristics of patients referred with a preliminary diagnosis of MODY, retrospectively. A total of 30 patients (18 male and 12 female) participated, with ages ranging from 5 to 56. Eight distinct genetic variants were identified in 17 cases (57%). Pathogenic variants in the HNF1A gene have been identified. Likely pathogenic variants were found in CEL, ABCC8, GCK, and HNF4A. The genes APPL1, BLK, INS, KCNJ1, KLF11, NEUROD1, PAX4, RFX6, and ZFP57 were shown to be mutation-free. Four distinct pathogenic variants are found in this series. Unexpectedly high rates of pathogenic variants have been found in the HNF1A gene. In 27% of cases, there is a family history of vertically transmitted diabetes. The study highlights the importance of genetic testing for individuals with early-onset diabetes and a strong family history of the condition. Comprehensive genetic testing and increased public awareness are essential for MODY.

[PMID: 38928025] Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is part of the heterogeneous group of monogenic diabetes (MD) characterized by the non-immune dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells. The diagnosis of MODY still remains a challenge for clinicians, with many cases being misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM/T2DM), and over 80% of cases remaining undiagnosed. With the introduction of modern technologies, important progress has been made in deciphering the molecular mechanisms and heterogeneous etiology of MD, including MODY. The aim of our study was to identify genetic variants associated with MODY in a group of patients with early-onset diabetes/prediabetes in whom a form of MD was clinically suspected. Genetic testing, based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, was carried out either in a targeted manner, using gene panels for monogenic diabetes, or by analyzing the entire exome (whole-exome sequencing). <i>GKC</i>-MODY 2 was the most frequently detected variant, but rare forms of <i>KCNJ11</i>-MODY 13, specifically, <i>HNF4A</i>-MODY 1, were also identified. We have emphasized the importance of genetic testing for early diagnosis, MODY subtype differentiation, and genetic counseling. We presented the genotype-phenotype correlations, especially related to the clinical evolution and personalized therapy, also emphasizing the particularities of each patient in the family context.

[PMID: 33565752] The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular basis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) by targeted-gene sequencing of 20 genes related to monogenic diabetes, estimate the frequency and describe the clinical characteristics of monogenic diabetes and MODY in the Trakya Region of Turkey. A panel of 20 monogenic diabetes related genes were screened in 61 cases. Illumina NextSeq550 system was used for sequencing. Pathogenicity of the variants were assessed by bioinformatics prediction software programs and segregation analyses. In 29 (47.5%) cases, 31 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the <i>GCK, ABCC8, KCNJ11, HNF1A, HNF4A</i> genes and in 11 (18%) cases, 14 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the <i>GCK, RFX6, CEL, PDX1, KCNJ11, HNF1A, G6PC2, GLIS3</i> and <i>KLF11</i> genes were identified. There were six different pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and six different VUS which were novel. This is the first study including molecular studies of twenty monogenic diabetes genes in Turkish cases in the Trakya Region. The results showed that pathogenic variants in the <i>GCK</i> gene are the leading cause of MODY in our population. A high frequency of novel variants (32.4%-12/37) in the current study, suggests that multiple gene analysis provides accurate genetic diagnosis in MODY.

[PMID: 33251707] Heterozygous pathogenic variants in HNF4A cause hyperinsulinism, maturity onset diabetes of the young type 1, and more rarely Fanconi renotubular syndrome. Specifically, the recurrent missense pathogenic variant c.253C>T (p.Arg85Trp) has been associated with a syndromic form of hyperinsulinism with additional features of macrosomia, renal tubular nephropathy, hypophosphatemic rickets, and liver involvement. We present an affected mother, who had been previously diagnosed clinically with the autosomal recessive Fanconi Bickel Syndrome, and her affected son. The son's presentation expands the clinical phenotype to include multiple congenital anomalies, including penile chordee with hypospadias and coloboma. This specific pathogenic variant should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Fanconi Bickel Syndrome when genetics are negative or the family history is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance. The inclusion of hyperinsulinism and maturity onset of the diabetes of the young changes the management of this syndrome and the recurrence risk is distinct. Additionally, this family also emphasizes the importance of genetic confirmation of clinical diagnoses, especially in adults who grew up in the premolecular era that are now coming to childbearing age. Finally, the expansion of the phenotype to include multiple congenital anomalies suggests that the full spectrum of HNF4A is likely unknown.

[PMID: 32710514] Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is often misdiagnosed as other types of diabetes because it is overlooked due to atypical clinical presentations. This study aims to reveal the clinical and laboratory clues and examine their compatibility with MODY genotypes. Participants consisted of 230 children with atypical presentations for type1(T1DM) and type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MODY-causing mutations were screened in the following genes:GCK-HNF1A-HNF4A-HNF1B-PDX1-NEUROD1-KLF11-CEL-PAX4-INS-BLK. Clinical and laboratory features were compared between children with MODY and children without MODY. The most common reasons for MODY screening were as follows (n/%):low daily dose of insulin (DDI) requirement (122/53%), absence of beta-cell antibodies(58/25.3%), coincidental hyperglycemia(26/11.3%), family history of diabetes (12/5.2%), hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia episodes(7/3%), hyperglycemia related to steroids(3/1.4%) and renal glycosuria(2/0.8%). The markers with the most likelihood to distinguish MODY from T1DM were determined as follows: measurable C-peptide in follow-up, family history of early-onset diabetes and low DDI requirement (odds ratio:12.55, 5.53 and 3.43, respectively). The distribution of the most common causative genes in children with MODY(n = 24) is as follows (n/%):GCK(15/62.5%), HNF4A(7/29.1%), HNF1A(1/9.2%) and PDX1(1/9.2%).All children(n = 12) with GCK-MODY(MODY2) were screened for low DDI requirement, while beta-cell negativity was more common in HNF4A-MODY(MODY1). The study shows that measurable C-peptide in follow-up, family history of early-onset diabetes, and low DDI are still remarkable clues to predict MODY in children with misdiagnosed T1DM. In addition, the most common mutations were found in the GCK and HNF4A genes. Among children misdiagnosed with T1DM, a low DDI requirement was found more frequently in MODY2, whereas beta-cell antibody negativity was more common in MODY1.

[PMID: 28597946] Mutations in causative genes for neonatal diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young have been identified in multiple patients with autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes (T1D). We aimed to clarify the prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of monogenic abnormalities among 89 children with autoantibody-negative insulin-requiring T1D. Mutations in 30 genes were screened using next-generation sequencing, and copy-number alterations of 4 major causative genes were examined using multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification. We compared the clinical characteristics between mutation carriers and non-carriers. We identified 11 probable pathogenic substitutions (6 in INS , 2 in HNF1A , 2 in HNF4A , and 1 in HNF1B ) in 11 cases, but no copy-number abnormalities. Only 2 mutation carriers had affected parents. De novo occurrence was confirmed for 3 mutations. The non-carrier group, but not the carrier group, was enriched with susceptible HLA alleles. Mutation carriers exhibited comparable phenotypes to those of non-carriers, except for a relatively normal body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis. This study demonstrated significant genetic overlap between autoantibody-negative T1D and monogenic diabetes. Mutations in INS and HNF genes, but not those in GCK and other monogenic diabetes genes, likely play critical roles in children with insulin-requiring T1D. This study also suggests the relatively high de novo rates of INS and HNF mutations, and the etiological link between autoimmune abnormalities and T1D in the non-carrier group. Carriers of monogenic mutations show non-specific phenotypes among all T1D cases, although they are more likely to have a normal BMI at diagnosis than non-carriers.

[PMID: 27486234] HNF4A mutations cause increased birth weight, transient neonatal hypoglycemia, and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The most frequently reported HNF4A mutation is p.R114W (previously p.R127W), but functional studies have shown inconsistent results; there is a lack of cosegregation in some pedigrees and an unexpectedly high frequency in public variant databases. We confirm that p.R114W is a pathogenic mutation with an odds ratio of 30.4 (95% CI 9.79-125, P = 2 × 10(-21)) for diabetes in our MODY cohort compared with control subjects. p.R114W heterozygotes did not have the increased birth weight of patients with other HNF4A mutations (3,476 g vs. 4,147 g, P = 0.0004), and fewer patients responded to sulfonylurea treatment (48% vs. 73%, P = 0.038). p.R114W has reduced penetrance; only 54% of heterozygotes developed diabetes by age 30 years compared with 71% for other HNF4A mutations. We redefine p.R114W as a pathogenic mutation that causes a distinct clinical subtype of HNF4A MODY with reduced penetrance, reduced sensitivity to sulfonylurea treatment, and no effect on birth weight. This has implications for diabetes treatment, management of pregnancy, and predictive testing of at-risk relatives. The increasing availability of large-scale sequence data is likely to reveal similar examples of rare, low-penetrance MODY mutations.

[PMID: 41187360] In porous polyethylene (PPE)-based microtia reconstruction, achieving an esthetically contoured ear remains a surgical challenge owing to complex soft tissue placement and need for seamless skin coverage. Although autologous techniques have standardized incision patterns, no systematic approach exists for alloplastic procedures. We propose a subtype-specific skin incision algorithm for PPE-based microtia reconstruction to improve esthetic outcomes, standardize surgical planning, and evaluate clinical effectiveness. This analysis included 15 patients (16 ears) who underwent PPE-based auricular reconstruction between October 2023 and June 2024. Incision types were selected using a subtype-specific algorithm: midline incisions for grade 1-3 microtia and perimastoid incisions for grade 4 and bilateral cases. Adult and pediatric patients were assessed preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) and Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory (GCBI), respectively. All patients were evaluated using the Auricular Reconstruction Evaluation Scale at 6 months. Among the 16 reconstructed ears, 9 and 7 underwent midline and perimastoid incisions, respectively. GBI and GCBI scores improved significantly postoperatively (p = 0.041 and p = 0.002, respectively). Preoperatively, GCBI scores were significantly lower than GBI scores (p = 0.002). The median evaluation scores included overall appearance (4.29 [IQR 4.17-4.43]), esthetic subunits (4.00 [IQR 3.95-4.20]), donor-site outcome (4.40 [IQR 4.20-4.60]), and psychosocial satisfaction (4.80 [IQR 4.70-4.90]). The proposed incision algorithm improves esthetic and psychosocial outcomes in PPE-based microtia reconstruction by reducing the need for skin grafts and preserving postauricular sulcus depth, thereby offering a practical and reproducible strategy for surgical planning.

[PMID: 41187357] To examine relationships among caregiver burden, parenting competence, and related factors in parents providing home-based care for children with medical complexity. We used a descriptive correlational, cross-sectional design and conducted path analysis. Convenience sampling was employed via pediatric visiting nurse stations in Kyoto and Shiga, Japan. Self-administered questionnaires were returned by 91 parents. The short version of the Japanese version of the Zarit Burden Interview and the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale were used. Analyses were performed in SPSS v29 and AMOS v29. After assessing all variable correlations, a path analysis was conducted to examine the direct and indirect effects of caregiver burden, parenting satisfaction, self-efficacy, and related variables. Caregiver burden negatively influenced parenting satisfaction (β = -0.383, p < .001) and was associated with inadequate rest (β = -0.271, p = .006) and shorter sleep duration (β = -0.228, p = .021). Higher medical complexity scores predicted greater parenting satisfaction (β = 0.202, p = .024) but were correlated with providing nighttime care (r = 0.275, p < .001), which reduced sleep duration. Model fit was adequate (goodness-of-fit index = 0.879; comparative fit index = 0.918; root mean square error of approximation = 0.043). Caregiver burden was a key factor affecting parenting competence among parents. Interventions aimed at reducing caregiver burden, such as facilitating adequate sleep and rest, may enhance their parenting competence. Future studies should recruit larger and more diverse samples and use longitudinal designs to increase generalizability and clarify temporal relationships.

[PMID: 41187340] Infections from Shigella spp./enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) are considered leading causes of diarrheal disease globally. However, there is a notable paucity of studies from Caribbean nations to guide regional public health interventions. A case-control study was conducted as part of a cross-sectional healthcare study in Haiti. Households were identified using a geospatially randomized method, and families with children under 5 years of age were consented and enrolled. Rectal swabs from child participants were tested for Shigella spp./EIEC via real-time polymerase chain reaction testing using the invasion plasmid antigen H gene target. Two case definitions were used: ""diarrheal symptom"" (DS) cases were defined as those reporting DSs ≤7 days ago; ""acute diarrhea"" (AD) cases were defined as those who also presented with ≥3 loose stools in the past 24 hours and onset <7 days ago. A total of 568 households were enrolled, and samples from 732 children were analyzed. The rates of Shigella spp./EIEC detection were 11% (22/193) and 6% (33/539) among DS cases and controls, respectively, and 19% (8/43) and 7% (47/689) among AD cases and controls, respectively. Shigella spp./EIEC was attributed to DS in 6% (95% CI: 0.4% to 11%) of cases and AD in 13% (95% CI: 0% to 25%) of cases. The adjusted odds of having DS increased by 84% (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.27) and AD increased by 183% (aOR = 2.83; 95% CI: 1.14 to 6.36) when Shigella spp./EIEC was detected. The rates of bloody diarrhea were minimal (<1%; 6/732). In the present case-control study, the detection of Shigella spp./EIEC was common and attributed to symptomatic disease. These results align with previous global health studies. Shigella spp./EIEC represent an important public health target for intervention once the security situation improves in Haiti.",10
A single nucleotide variant the gene DGKK is strongly associated with increased risk of hypospadias.,hypospadias AND single nucleotide variant AND DGKK gene AND risk association,"40335670,31102501,29464676,28597849,25327554,21113153,41187382,41187363,41187362,41187351","[PMID: 40335670] X-chromosome variants contribute significantly to hypospadias risk but have not been fully elucidated in the Chinese population. Here we aim to assess how X-chromosome variants contribute to hypospadias susceptibility in the Chinese population. We recruited 1,073 boys with hypospadias and 5,150 controls in a southern Chinese population. Single-variant and gene/pathway-based association analyses were conducted for the distal and proximal hypospadias. Haplotype analysis was performed on top susceptibility genes. Additionally, we performed a multi-ancestral comparison between the East Asian and European populations. We performed an X-chromosome-wide association study on 987 patients and 4,761 controls that met quality control standards. We confirmed DGKK variants as multi-ancestral susceptibility loci for distal hypospadias (lead SNP: rs5961181, P = 1.82 × 10<sup>- 7</sup>), but not for the proximal subtype. Distinct association signals were identified for distal hypospadias (DGKK-CCNB3-AKAP4, PNPLA4, AR-OPHN1, TAF7L, IL1RAPL1) and proximal hypospadias (SMIM10L2A, PRR32 and Xq28 gene cluster). Pathway analysis revealed that distal hypospadias is associated with male gamete generation, epithelial cell polarity, and lipid/sterol metabolism, while proximal hypospadias is linked to amino acid metabolism and gastrulation. Except for DGKK, all candidate genes showed population-favored associations compared to European studies. Haplotype analysis of DGKK, PNPLA4, OPHN1 and IL1RAPL1 showed increased risk for specific risk haplotypes (OR ranged from 4.35 to 6.25). Our findings highlight the importance of X chromosome variants in hypospadias etiology and reveal subtype- and population-specific genetic architecture. Our results improve the understanding of genetic susceptibility for hypospadias risk and provide insights into risk prediction and personalized prevention strategies in hypospadias management.

[PMID: 31102501] Recent genome-wide association studies of hypospadias have implicated the role of genetic variants in or near the diacylglycerol kinase kappa (DGKK) gene. However, these variants are largely identified among samples of mild and moderate hypospadias cases. Therefore, we evaluated previously identified DGKK variants among second- and third-degree hypospadias cases and controls recruited in Arkansas, a state characterized by a high birth prevalence of hypospadias. Second- and third-degree hypospadias non-Hispanic white cases (n = 36 and n = 9, respectively) and controls (n = 45) were recruited at Arkansas Children's Hospital. Preputial tissue was collected on cases and controls between 2013 and 2017. Cases and controls were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array. We used logistic regression models to assess the association of genotyped and imputed genetic variants mapped to the DGKK region with second- and third-degree hypospadias. All families self-reported as non-Hispanic white and genetic principal component analyses did not demonstrate evidence of population stratification. Five DGKK variants previously reported as associated with hypospadias were identified in the genotype data. None of the variants were associated with second- or third-degree hypospadias (range of odds ratios = 0.7-0.9, all p > .05). In our analyses, genetic variation in DGKK does not play a role in the development of moderate and severe hypospadias. Our findings provide support to the etiologic heterogeneity of hypospadias by all classifications of severity.

[PMID: 29464676] Hypospadias is a common developmental anomaly of the male external genitalia. In previous studies conducted on West European, Californian, and Han Chinese populations the relationship between polymorphic variants of the diacylglycerol kinase kappa (DGKK) gene and hypospadias have been reported. The aim was to study the possible associations between polymorphic variants of the DGKK gene and hypospadias using an independent sample of the Polish population. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms in DGKK, which were reported to have an impact on the risk of hypospadias in other populations, were genotyped using high-resolution melting curve analysis in a group of 166 boys with isolated anterior (66%) and middle (34%) forms of hypospadias and 285 properly matched controls without congenital anomalies. Two DGKK variants rs11091748 and rs12171755 were associated with increased risk of hypospadias in the Polish population. These results were statistically significant, even after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (P < .005). All the tested nucleotide variants were involved in haplotype combinations associated with hypospadias. The global p-values for haplotypes comprising of rs4143304-rs11091748, rs11091748-rs17328236, rs1934179-rs4554617, rs1934183-rs1934179-rs4554617 and rs12171755-rs1934183-rs1934179-rs4554617 were statistically significant, even after the permutation test correction. Our study provides strong evidence of an association between DGKK nucleotide variants, haplotypes and hypospadias susceptibility.

[PMID: 28597849] Previous genome-wide association studies have identified variants in the diacylglycerol kinase kappa (DGKK) gene associated with hypospadias in populations of European descent. However, no variants of DGKK were confirmed to be associated with hypospadias in a recent Han Chinese study population, likely due to the limited number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) included in the analysis. In this study, we aimed to address the inconsistent results and evaluate the association between DGKK and hypospadias in the Han Chinese population through a more comprehensive analysis of DGKK variants. We conducted association analyses for 17 SNPs in or downstream of DGKK with hypospadias among 322 cases (58 mild, 113 moderate, 128 severe, and 23 unknown) and 1008 controls. Five SNPs (rs2211122, rs4554617, rs7058226, rs7063116, and rs5915254) in DGKK were significantly associated with hypospadias (P < 0.05), with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.64-1.76. When only mild and moderate cases were compared to controls, 10 SNPs in DGKK were significant (P < 0.05), with ORs of 1.56-2.13. No significant SNP was observed when only severe cases were compared to controls. This study successfully implicated DGKK variants in hypospadias risk among a Han Chinese population, especially for mild/moderate cases. Severe forms of hypospadias are likely due to other genetic factors.

[PMID: 25327554] To investigate whether diacylglycerol kinase κ (DGKK) is a susceptibility gene for hypospadias in the Han Chinese population as has been suggested by previous publications. A case-control study involving 466 patients with hypospadias and 402 healthy subjects was conducted to assess the relationship between DGKK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and hypospadias risk in the Han Chinese population. The 466 hypospadias patients were further divided into mild, moderate and severe subgroups for analysis. Six SNPs (rs1934179, rs4143304, rs9969978, rs1934188, rs4826632 and rs4599945) were marginally associated with mild and moderate hypospadias [odds ratios (ORs) > 1, P = 0.05 to P < 0.1), whereas no significant relationship was seen with the severe cases (ORs >1, P > 0.1). After correcting for multiple testing, it was determined that neither individual SNPs nor individual haplotypes were associated with hypospadias. To evaluate this relationship in multiple populations, we performed a meta-analysis on six SNPs, using combined data from our present results and those of previous studies of different races (including 1966 patients and 2492 controls). Six SNPs (rs1934179, rs4143304, rs9969978, rs1934188, rs7063116 and rs1934190) were significantly associated with mild/moderate hypospadias (ORs >1, P < 0.05), and rs1934179 was significantly associated with severe hypospadias (OR > 1, P < 0.05). DGKK gene variants do not appear to play a major role in hypospadias susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. Our meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that DGKK is a common risk gene for hypospadias, particularly in cases of mild or moderate hypospadias in Caucasian populations.

[PMID: 21113153] Hypospadias is a common congenital malformation of the male external genitalia. We performed a genome-wide association study using pooled DNA from 436 individuals with hypospadias (cases) and 494 controls of European descent and selected the highest ranked SNPs for individual genotyping in the discovery sample, an additional Dutch sample of 133 cases and their parents, and a Swedish series of 266 cases and 402 controls. Individual genotyping of two SNPs (rs1934179 and rs7063116) in DGKK, encoding diacylglycerol kinase κ, produced compelling evidence for association with hypospadias in the discovery sample (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, P = 2.5 × 10⁻¹¹ and OR = 2.3, P = 2.9 × 10⁻⁹, respectively) and in the Dutch (OR = 3.9, P = 2.4 × 10⁻⁵ and OR = 3.8, P = 3.4 × 10⁻⁵) and Swedish (OR = 2.5, P = 2.6 × 10⁻⁸ and OR = 2.2, P = 2.7 × 10⁻⁶) replication samples. Expression studies showed expression of DGKK in preputial tissue of cases and controls, which was lower in carriers of the risk allele of rs1934179 (P = 0.047). We propose DGKK as a major risk gene for hypospadias.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187363] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains a major respiratory pathogen of economic concern in the poultry industry. This study investigated the farm-level prevalence of IBV and evaluated associated risk factors in northern Vietnam by a cross-sectional study from June 2022 to June 2024. A total of 69 poultry farms were randomly selected across nine provinces, and pooled tracheal swab samples were purposively collected for IBV detection using RT-qPCR. The overall IBV farm-level prevalence was 34.78 % (95 % CI:23.71-47.21 %). Although no statistically significant differences were found across provinces, production types, age groups, or flock sizes, IBV was detected in all subgroups, indicating widespread circulation of the virus. A total of 22 potential risk factors were initially assessed using univariate logistic regression. Of these, six variables with P < 0.1, including farm size, number of poultry houses, presence of multiple age groups, vaccination at day-old, frequency of disinfection before chick placement, and proximity to live bird markets and residential areas, were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model retained two independent predictors: performing more than one disinfection before chick placement (P = 0.035), and administration of a live IB vaccine at one day of age (P = 0.006), both of which were significantly associated with reduced the odds of IBV infection at the farm level. These findings suggest that strategic vaccination and careful calibration of disinfection protocols are critical to minimizing IBV transmission at the farm level.

[PMID: 41187362] The risk of a foreign animal disease coming into the United States and threatening the swine industry necessitates the need for enhanced biosecurity plans to mitigate risks to premises. Although most biosecurity information is aimed and created for larger producers and isn't appropriate for smaller producers, such as swine exhibitors. Swine exhibitors are a niche group who raise swine differently than large producers and travel extensively with their animals. This study sought out to; develop a SPS plan template adapted from the SPS framework that would be suitable for swine exhibitors' biosecurity features; describe basic demographics and existence of biosecurity plan (and their features) for the target population; and investigate the association between having a previous biosecurity plan on site and demographic factors (number of pigs, type of housing, presence of other animal species in the premise and geographical region) as well as potential exposure to feral swine under their current housing conditions. These objectives were accomplished by attending twelve swine exhibitions within a year and a half to assist 161 individuals in the creation of personalized biosecurity plans for their premises, while obtaining additional study data. This study found no significant relationship between demographic factors and previously having a biosecurity plan, but that only 31.8 % of participants had previous biosecurity plans on their premise. However, swine exhibitors with existing biosecurity plans had more than 3-fold higher odds of acknowledging housing conditions with potential of feral swine contact compared to swine exhibitors without preexisting biosecurity plans. These findings indicate the need for additional efforts to assist swine exhibitors in creating biosecurity plans at shows across the United States.

[PMID: 41187351] Epidemiological studies of large groups of nuclear industry workers offer a significant opportunity to increase our understanding of the long-term effects on health of the protracted accumulation of dose received at a low dose rate from many discrete exposures to ionising radiation. The effects of such extended aggregation of doses form an important part of the everyday concerns of radiological protection against low-level exposures. For more than half a century, databases of nuclear workers have been assembled, and the numbers of workers currently included in studies, together with the numbers of deaths among them that have now occurred, are capable of generating reasonably precise risk estimates that should provide meaningful comparisons with those obtained from other studies, such as of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, constructing, updating and maintaining these large databases, linking workers to occupational dose databases and to registers of deaths (and other outcomes, such as incident cancers) and their causes, and analyses of these data that endeavour to take account of other influential factors (such as smoking) are far from straightforward. A critical review of recent nuclear worker studies illustrates the difficulties in reliably interpreting reported statistical associations between rates of cancer and cumulative occupational doses because of the real possibility of distortions produced by biases, confounding and/or the interplay of radiation with other risk factors. This doesn't mean that studies of nuclear workers should be abandoned, far from it, but it does mean that appropriate effort needs to be expended on these studies before confident conclusions about the levels of risks from radiation exposure can be drawn from them. Unexpected findings should be examined in depth to gain a proper understanding of their origin, including the impact of doses from intakes of radionuclides upon dose-responses derived using doses from external sources of radiation.",10
A strong bias in the phage genome locations where the spacers were derived has been observed in many CRISPR subtypes that confer the immunity to phage.,CRISPR AND spacer acquisition AND phage genome location AND CRISPR subtype diversity,"30905291,30157725,41187216,41187082,41186968,41186962,41186426,41186035,41185939,41185624","[PMID: 30905291] We investigated the diversity of CRISPR spacers of Thermus communities from two locations in Italy, two in Chile and one location in Russia. Among the five sampling sites, a total of more than 7200 unique spacers belonging to different CRISPR-Cas systems types and subtypes were identified. Most of these spacers are not found in CRISPR arrays of sequenced Thermus strains. Comparison of spacer sets revealed that samples within the same area (separated by few to hundreds of metres) have similar spacer sets, which appear to be largely stable at least over the course of several years. While at further distances (hundreds of kilometres and more) the similarity of spacer sets is decreased, there are still multiple common spacers in Thermus communities from different continents. The common spacers can be reconstructed in identical or similar CRISPR arrays, excluding their independent appearance and suggesting an extensive migration of thermophilic bacteria over long distances. Several new Thermus phages were isolated in the sampling sites. Mapping of spacers to bacteriophage sequences revealed examples of local acquisition of spacers from some phages and distinct patterns of targeting of phage genomes by different CRISPR-Cas systems. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The ecology and evolution of prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems'.

[PMID: 30157725] CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against invading genetic elements, such as plasmids, bacteriophages and archaeal viruses. They consist of cas genes and CRISPR loci, which store genetic memories of previously encountered invaders as short sequences termed spacers. Spacers determine the specificity of CRISPR-Cas defence and immunity can be gained or updated by the addition of new spacers into CRISPR loci. There are two main routes to spacer acquisition, which are known as naïve and primed CRISPR adaptation. Naïve CRISPR adaptation involves the de novo formation of immunity, independent of pre-existing spacers. In contrast, primed CRISPR adaptation (priming) uses existing spacers to enhance the acquisition of new spacers. Priming typically results in spacer acquisition from locations near the site of target recognition by the existing (priming) spacer. Primed CRISPR adaptation has been observed in several type I CRISPR-Cas systems and it is potentially widespread. However, experimental evidence is unavailable for some subtypes, and for most systems, priming has only been shown in a small number of hosts. There is also no current evidence of priming by other CRISPR-Cas types. Here, we used a bioinformatic approach to search for evidence of priming in diverse CRISPR-Cas systems. By analysing the clustering of spacers acquired from phages, prophages and archaeal viruses, including strand and directional biases between subsequently acquired spacers, we demonstrate that two patterns of primed CRISPR adaptation dominate in type I systems. In addition, we find evidence of a priming-like pathway in type II CRISPR-Cas systems.

[PMID: 41187216] Many taxa have independently evolved genetic sex determination where a single gene located on a sex chromosome controls gonadal differentiation. The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex-reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the ""Four Core Genotypes"" model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.

[PMID: 41187082] The development of microfluidic technologies has enabled chemical and biological analysis systems with increased functionality, complexity, and parallelization. These functionalities often drive the creation and control of complex and dynamic fluidic architectures. Introduced here is a class of microfluidic network based on isotachophoresis (ITP), an electrokinetic process that can extract and purify samples, selectively transport, mix, and aliquot (split) samples in a system with no moving parts. Presented is a theoretical framework to describe these networks. The framework relies on the coupling between a one-dimensional description of ITP and two-dimensional, transient graphs to describe the dynamic evolution of ITP networks. We leverage this framework to create numerical simulations of branched ITP circuits. We build, control, and experimentally study a variety of ITP networks. These systems automatically split and merge ITP zones, enabling complex sample manipulation with minimal external control. The model captures the experimentally observed sample dynamics. We demonstrate an example system where an ITP network is used to control and quantify parallel CRISPR-Cas enzymatic reactions. The methods described here are generally applicable to highly complex topologies and may offer a basis for easily reconfigurable, electric field-driven microfluidic systems. Networks generally offer broad potential for automated chemical and biochemical analysis and lab-on-a-chip integration.

[PMID: 41186968] Rice cooking and eating quality (CEQ), a core agronomic trait tied to consumer preference and market value, is regulated by endosperm starch, protein, and lipid metabolism; this review synthesizes advances in its molecular mechanisms, focusing on genetic determinants and regulatory networks of storage substances. Starch is key: the Wx gene (central hub) has ≥ 9 allelic variants (e.g., Wxᵃ, Wxᵇ and Wx<sup>ela</sup>), modulating amylose content (AC) via GBSSI activity, Wx gene expression levels, splicing efficiency, etc., and exerting pleiotropic effects on protein/lipid metabolism, grain transparency, and taste; storage proteins (80% glutelin) harm CEQ by inhibiting starch gelatinisation, regulated by relevant gene families and vesicular pathways (e.g., Rab5a-VPS9a); lipids (0.3%-3% of endosperm) affect Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) profiles and aroma via genes like OsFAD, PDCT, FGC3; modules (e.g., OsNF-Ys, OsbZIP60, Ghd7-OsNAC42) balance starch-protein accumulation. Breeding strategies include marker-assisted selection, CRISPR/Cas9 editing of Wx elements or glutelin genes, gene pyramiding (Wx, ALK, GS3), and artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated intelligent breeding to boost efficiency; the review first proposes a framework: 'Wx genotype determination - amylopectin/glutelin regulation - CEQ improvement', and the establishment of this framework is rooted in the core role of the Wx gene in determining rice eating quality, which is achieved through its pleiotropic regulation of starch, protein, and lipid metabolism in the endosperm. Future directions: use Wx allelic diversity, decipher multi-omics modules (e.g., RNA methylation in starch metabolism), and integrate aroma, Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), grain shape, chalkiness, sugar transport genes to balance yield and CEQ for rice breeding.

[PMID: 41186962] Whole-genome sequencing identifies intronic variants whose pathogenicity can be predicted with tools like SpliceAI. However, an actionable classification of such variants may require RNA-based validation, which can be limited by low expression in clinically accessible tissues. We report two fetuses from one family with Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 6 (AMC6 [OMIM # 619334]) and biallelic NEB variants: a paternally inherited likely pathogenic frameshift variant, Chr2(GRCh38):g.151579391del; NM_001164508.2:c.16653del; NP_001157980.2:p.(Asp5552ThrfsTer5), and a maternally inherited intronic variant of uncertain clinical significance, Chr2(GRCh38):g.151496267G>A; NM_001164508.2:c.24486+9C>T; NP_001157980.2:p.(?). Because NEB is poorly expressed in fibroblasts, we used CRISPR activation to induce its expression in fibroblasts from the heterozygous mother. RNA-sequencing subsequently confirmed that the intronic variant generated a novel splice donor site associated with inferred loss of splicing at the canonical donor site. After NMD-inhibition, we could thus identify 45.5% of NEB transcripts with a 7 bp exon extension, predicted to result in a protein-coding frameshift. The intronic variant was classified as likely pathogenic, allowing a genetic diagnosis.

[PMID: 41186426] There has been a resurgence and ongoing outbreak of avian influenza since early 2024. Avian influenza, caused by influenza A viruses, poses significant threats to both avian populations and public health due to its zoonotic potential. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, such as the H5N1 and H7 subtypes, has a high mortality rate. Traditional detection methods, i.e., virus isolation and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), are reliable for diagnosis but time-consuming and labor-intensive. Rapid and accurate detection of avian influenza A viruses is crucial to prevent widespread outbreaks and minimize economic losses. Field-ready and point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, such as lateral flow assays (LFAs) offer a rapid, early, and large-scale approach for detecting avian influenza A virus infections. Early detection in HPAI management is a key factor in improving treatment effectiveness and reducing the negative impact on animal health. This minireview introduces the principles and techniques of current field-ready and POC diagnostics, emphasizing LFAs for HPAI detection. It also outlines and compares their development, applications, and availability in the market. Notably, advanced techniques such as LFAs-integrated clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) have expanded HPAI diagnostic capabilities and have also been reviewed. CRISPR-based LFAs use guide RNA to detect viral sequences, activating Cas enzymes that generate a visible signal on test strips, enabling a rapid and sensitive detection method. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review summarizing LFA-based HPAI diagnostics in the context of the 2024 resurgence, offering timely insight into their potential roles in outbreak preparedness and response.

[PMID: 41185939] Despite the tremendous potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology in precision therapeutics, intracellular delivery remains a major challenge. High cytoplasmic viscosity and lysosomal entrapment significantly impair the cytosolic transport and gene-editing efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate that both the size and magnetic responsiveness of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters can be finely tuned by modulating ionic strength, enabling their rapid propulsion under external magnetic fields. Leveraging this property, we develop magnetic nanoparticle cluster nanorobots (MagCbots) of approximately 200 nm in size by electrostatically assembling Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids. Under magnetic actuation, MagCbots exhibit rapid rotation in highly viscous intracellular environments, achieving a linear velocity of ∼0.41 μm/s. MagCbots reduce intracellular viscosity by approximately 50% and enhance lysosomal escape efficiency by 3-fold compared to nonactuated counterparts. Their porous architecture not only offers high payload capacity but also protects plasmid DNA from enzymatic degradation. Notably, MagCbots enable efficient genome editing of both PD1 and PLK1 genes across various cell lines including hard-to-transfect Jurkat T cells. This magnetically driven nanorobot platform presents a promising strategy for active intracellular delivery and holds significant potential for advancing gene therapy and related biomedical applications.

[PMID: 41185624] Regulated necrosis is a known direct consequence of activation of the necroptosis- and pyroptosis- pathways, but may also result from apoptosis in a process referred to as secondary necrosis. Apoptosis is well understood to be mediated by caspase activation, but the mechanisms that lead to plasma membrane rupture in secondary necrosis remain considerably obscure. Recent data suggested a caspase-mediated cleavage of gasdermin E (GSDME), a member of the gasdermin family. Here, apoptosis induced by diphtheria toxin (DT) is employed as a novel tool to study secondary necrosis. In addition, cisplatin and anti-Fas monoclonal antibody Jo2 are employed to study secondary necrosis in cell culture and in vivo, respectively. Despite prominent, yet epiphenomenal cleavage of GSDME, it is demonstrated that silencing or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of GSDME does not compromise the kinetics of secondary necrosis induced by DT or cisplatin. During Jo2-induced acute liver toxicity in mice, GSDME expressed in the necrotic liver is detected predominantly in its uncleaved form. In conclusion, the hypothesis of GSDME to be a central mediator of secondary necrosis in these model systems is disproved.",10
ALDH1 expression is associated with poorer prognosis for breast cancer primary tumors.,ALDH1 AND expression AND breast cancer AND prognosis,"41179319,41179310,41102839,41033308,41006005,40995140,40943144,40543226,40414980,39796106","[PMID: 41179319] The role of catenin β interacting protein 1 (<i>CTNNBIP1</i>), a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, in luminal A and B breast cancer stem cells treated with hormone therapy is unknown. This study investigated the relationship between <i>CTNNBIP1</i> and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A3 (<i>ALDH1A3</i>) expression and its impact on disease-specific survival in luminal A and B breast cancer. Given that high protein kinase ζ (<i>PKCζ</i>) expression, together with elevated <i>CTNNBIP1</i> or <i>ALDH1A3</i>, is linked to poor prognosis in luminal B tumors, we also examined their combined influence. Gene expression and clinical data from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC; n=2,509) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Findings were validated with The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Atlas (TCGA; n=1,084). <i>CTNNBIP1</i> <sup>high</sup> <i>ALDH1A3</i> <sup>high</sup> indicated a poor prognosis in patients with luminal B breast cancer treated with hormone therapy in the METABRIC dataset and aromatase inhibitors as hormone therapy in the TCGA data set, suggesting that high <i>CTNNBIP1</i> and <i>ALDH1A3</i> expression contributed to decreased effectiveness of hormone therapy in patients with luminal B breast cancer. <i>PKC</i> <i>ζ</i> <sup>high</sup> <i>CTNNBIP1</i> <sup>high</sup> <i>ALDH1A3</i> <sup>high</sup> was associated with a poor prognosis in patients with luminal B breast cancer treated with hormone therapy and aromatase inhibitors, suggesting that high <i>PKC</i> <i>ζ</i> <i>, CTNNBIP1</i> and <i>ALDH1A3</i> expression contributed to decreased effectiveness of hormone therapy in patients with luminal B breast cancer. <i>PKC</i> <i>ζ</i> and <i>CTNNBIP1</i> may be involved in the progression of ALDH1A3-positive luminal B breast cancer.

[PMID: 41179310] High expression of <i>p62</i> and <i>ALDH1A3</i> indicates a poor clinical outcome in luminal B breast cancer, and p62 is involved in the progression of ALDH1-positive luminal B breast cancer stem cells. However, the association between endocrine therapy and high <i>p62</i> and <i>ALDH1A3</i> expression, in luminal B breast cancer remains unclear. Two datasets with gene expression and clinical data for patients with primary breast cancer (METABRIC, n=2,509; The Cancer Genome Atlas, n=1,084) were downloaded and statistically analyzed. To evaluate the association between the <i>p62</i> and <i>ALDH1A3</i> expression levels and endocrine therapy, including tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor, in patients with luminal B breast cancer, disease-specific survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Patients with <i>p62</i> <sup>high</sup> <i>ALDH1A3</i> <sup>high</sup> luminal B breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy exhibited a poor prognosis. Moreover, patients with <i>p62</i> <sup>high</sup> <i>ALDH1A3</i> <sup>high</sup> luminal B breast cancer treated with tamoxifen showed a trend towards a poor prognosis, but those treated with aromatase inhibitors showed a significantly poor prognosis. These results suggest that endocrine therapy, especially aromatase inhibitors, exhibits a reduced effectiveness against <i>p62</i> <sup>high</sup> <i>ALDH1A3</i> <sup>high</sup> luminal B tumors. <i>p62</i> and <i>ALDH1A3</i> could be used together as a prognostic biomarker for predicting the efficacy of endocrine therapy for luminal B breast cancer.

[PMID: 41102839] Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive and has limited therapeutic options due to the absence of targeted therapies, highlighting the urgent need for prognostic biomarkers linked to cancer stemness and chemoresistance. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), a key regulator of stem cell properties, remains incompletely characterized in TNBC clinical cohorts. ALDH1 mRNA expression levels were analyzed using the GEO2R online database, and its prognostic significance was assessed via the Kaplan‒Meier plotter tool. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed on a tissue microarray comprising 96 TNBC samples and paired adjacent normal tissues from patients treated at Binzhou People's Hospital between 2016 and 2022. The associations between ALDH1 expression and clinicopathological parameters were evaluated using the chi-square test. Bioinformatics analysis revealed significantly higher ALDH1 mRNA expression in TNBC tissues compared to adjacent benign tissues. Kaplan‒Meier survival analysis demonstrated that elevated ALDH1 mRNA expression was associated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. IHC staining further confirmed elevated ALDH1 protein expression in TNBC tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues. However, there was no significant correlation between ALDH1 expression and conventional clinicopathological parameters, including age, menopausal status, tumor size, TNM stage, histological grade, histological subtype, axillary lymph node metastasis and the Ki-67 index (p > 0.05). High ALDH1 expression was significantly associated with poorer overall survival ( χ<sup>2</sup> = 16.836, p < 0.001). Our data demonstrate that ALDH1 expression is not significantly associated with conventional clinicopathological parameters (such as age, TNM stage, or histological grade). Instead, it is associated with poorer survival on univariate analysis in TNBC patients. Its lack of association with clinicopathological factors suggests its potential utility as a supplementary prognostic indicator.

[PMID: 41033308] Basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive subtype with limited therapeutic options. Here, transcriptomic analysis of public datasets suggested distinct subtype- and cell-specific expression patterns of ALDH1A isoforms in breast tumors, with ALDH1A3 predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of basal-like tumors, whereas ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A1 were enriched in stromal and immune-associated subpopulations. High expression of ALDH1A3 and ALDH1A2, but not ALDH1A1, is associated with poor prognosis in high-grade, lymph-node-positive tumors. To evaluate therapeutic targeting, we developed ABD0171, an irreversible, selective ALDH1A3 inhibitor with additional ALDH1A1 activity. ABD0171 disrupted key oncogenic pathways, including IL6/JAK/STAT3, tPA, and Src/FAK, resulting in robust antitumor and antimetastatic effects in vitro and in vivo, with a favorable safety profile. These findings establish ALDH1A3 as a therapeutic target in breast cancers with epithelial-basal traits and validate ABD0171 as a promising clinical candidate to address current treatment challenges.

[PMID: 41006005] The relationship between the protein kinase C zeta (<i>PKCζ</i>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A3 (<i>ALDH1A3</i>) expression levels and endocrine therapy susceptibility in luminal A and luminal B breast cancer subtypes is unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze this relationship in terms of disease-specific survival. Open-source datasets with clinical and gene expression information (METABRIC, n=2509; and TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas, n=1084) were downloaded and analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. The results indicated that high <i>PKCζ</i> and <i>ALDH1A3</i> expression levels were associated with a poor prognosis in patients with luminal B type breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy, including aromatase inhibitors. These results suggest that high expression of <i>PKCζ</i> and <i>ALDH1A3</i> contributes to reduced effectiveness of endocrine therapy in patients with luminal B breast cancer. <i>PKCζ</i> may be involved in the progression of ALDH1A3-positive luminal B breast cancer. Furthermore, <i>PKCζ</i> and <i>ALDH1A3</i> could serve as molecular targets and prognostic biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of endocrine therapy in patients with ALDH1A3 positive luminal B breast cancer.

[PMID: 40995140] The present study aimed to identify novel clinical biomarkers for breast cancer (BRCA) through bioinformatics analyses and cellular experiments, due to the ongoing need for improved diagnosis and prognosis in BRCA. The GSE21422 and The Cancer Genome Atlas-BRCA (TCGA-BRCA) datasets were utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BRCA. Common DEGs were subjected to comprehensive analyses, including risk score modeling, expression profiling, receiver operating characteristic curve evaluation, survival analysis and the development of a prognostic nomogram, to pinpoint clinically significant genes. Cellular assays were subsequently performed to investigate the functional roles of these key genes in BRCA. Through bioinformatics analyses, 5 genes with diagnostic value were identified: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1), Rac/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6 (ARHGEF6), enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit, integrin α1 (ITGA1) and PIK3R1, as well as 3 genes with prognostic value: ALDH1A1, ARHGEF6 and ITGA1. Among them, ARHGEF6 was recognized as the key gene in BRCA. Overexpression of ARHGEF6 was shown to suppress cell proliferation, invasion and migration, while promoting apoptosis in BRCA. In conclusion, by bioinformatics analysis, new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for patients with BRCA have been identified and the key gene, ARHGEF6, is a suppressor gene in BRCA progression. These findings provide new directions for BRCA clinical application.

[PMID: 40943144] Multiple markers exist for breast cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are believed to represent the phenotypes of various CSC types and/or states. The relationship between each CSC subpopulation/state and the primary hallmarks of cancer has not been sufficiently clarified. In this study, six CSC markers (CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>, CD24, Ep-CAM, ALDH1, CD10, and BMI1) were assessed in a surgical cohort of 73 breast cancer patients. The expression of a single or multiple CSC markers was correlated with clinicopathological parameters, including markers of immune evasion, proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and survival. All CSC phenotypes, except for CD10, correlated with markers indicative of higher proliferation. The CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup> phenotype correlated with markers of EMT and PD-L1 expression, unlike ALDH1<sup>hi</sup>. Both Ep-CAM<sup>hi</sup> and CD24<sup>hi</sup> breast cancer were associated with indicators of immune evasion, including PD-L1 expression, and the infiltration of FOXP3+ and PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). While the CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>, Ep-CAM<sup>hi</sup>, and ALDH1<sup>hi</sup> phenotypes correlated with shorter overall survival (OS), CD24<sup>hi</sup> correlated with reduced disease-free survival (DFS). Interestingly, among all tested CSC markers, the CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>-ALDH1<sup>hi</sup> combination phenotype correlated with the worst DFS (HR 2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.014 in univariate/multivariate analysis) and OS (<i>p</i> < 0.001, HR 6.4 in univariate and 5.4 in multivariate analysis). A side-by-side comparison of multiple CSC markers demonstrated the differential linkage of CSC phenotype/state with distinct features of breast cancer. This comparison demonstrates the advantage of the CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>-ALDH1<sup>hi</sup> combination marker for prognostication, especially after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the future, distinct markers of CSCs can hopefully be leveraged to trace/monitor different disease characteristics or treatment outcomes.

[PMID: 40543226] Breast cancer (BC) is a prevalent malignant neoplasm. Utilizing the GEPIA database for analysis and subsequent validation via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we identified that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A2 (ALDH1A2) exhibits reduced expression and heightened methylation in BC, which is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. In vitro cellular assays demonstrated that the overexpression of ALDH1A2 attenuates the proliferative, invasive, and migratory capacities of breast cancer cell lines, concurrently reducing apoptotic rates. Subsequent investigations employing Methylation-Specific PCR and Western blot analysis in breast cancer cells uncovered that DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is implicated in the DNA methylation of ALDH1A2, with the suppression of DNMT3B leading to an elevation in ALDH1A2 protein levels, thereby establishing an inverse relationship between DNMT3B and ALDH1A2. Furthermore, through the prediction of transcription factors binding to the promoter region of DNMT3B, we discerned that zinc fingers and BTB domain containing 12 (ZBTB12) transcriptionally activates DNMT3B, thereby repressing ALDH1A2 expression. Cellular assays revealed that the knockdown of ZBTB12 or the overexpression of DNMT3B correspondingly inhibits or enhances the proliferative, invasive, and migratory capabilities of breast cancer cells, with DNMT3B abrogating the suppressive effects of si-ZBTB12. Our findings elucidate a novel mechanism involving ALDH1A2 in the progression of breast cancer, where ZBTB12 transcriptionally activates DNMT3B, and the ZBTB12-DNMT3B axis orchestrates the methylation and consequent silencing of ALDH1A2.

[PMID: 40414980] Interleukin-33 (IL-33) plays multifaceted roles in tumor progression, but its autocrine regulation of breast cancer stemness and metastasis via the Wnt pathway remains unclear. Here, we investigated the IL-33/ST2 axis in breast cancer using CRISPR/Cas9, single-cell RNA sequencing, and murine models (orthotopic 4T1 and spontaneous MMTV-PyMT). Elevated IL-33 levels correlated with aggressive subtypes and poor prognosis. IL-33 overexpression enhanced proliferation, migration, and cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression (CD44, ALDH1) in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas ST2 knockdown via CRISPR or adeno-associated virus (AAV) attenuated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, reducing CSC frequency. Mechanistically, IL-33 activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote stemness, which was reversed by the Wnt inhibitor XAV-939. Single-cell analysis revealed that IL-33 overexpression skewed the immune microenvironment toward immunosuppression, while ST2 knockdown restored antitumor immunity. Our findings establish an IL-33-Wnt axis as a critical driver of breast cancer aggressiveness and propose AAV-mediated ST2 silencing as a novel therapeutic strategy. Targeting this axis may offer dual benefits by suppressing stemness and enhancing immune surveillance, warranting clinical exploration for advanced breast cancer.

[PMID: 39796106] The goal of this paper is to discuss the role of ALDH isozymes in different cancers, review advances in ALDH1-targeting cancer therapies, and explore a mechanism that explains how ALDH expression becomes elevated during cancer development. ALDH is often overexpressed in cancer, and each isoform has a unique expression pattern and a distinct role in different cancers. The abnormal expression of ALDHs in different cancer types (breast, colorectal, lung, gastric, cervical, melanoma, prostate, and renal) is presented and correlated with patient prognosis. ALDH plays a significant role in various cellular functions, such as metabolism, oxidative stress response, detoxification, and cellular differentiation. Among the ALDH families, ALDH1 has gained considerable attention as a cancer stem cell (CSC) marker due to its significant role in the maintenance of stemness and the differentiation of stem cells (SCs), along with its involvement in tumorigenesis. A description of the cellular mechanisms and physiology of ALDH1 that underlies cancer development is provided. Moreover, current advances in ALDH1-targeting cancer therapies are discussed.",10
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation reduces inflammation-related fibrosis in the lungs.,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) AND activation AND inflammation-related fibrosis AND lung,"31302199,41187379,41187370,41187369,41187366,41187365,41187364,41187361,41187356,41187355","[PMID: 31302199] Mineralocorticoid receptor activation of the epithelial sodium channel in endothelial cells (ECs) (EnNaC) is accompanied by aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated arterial relaxation. Recent data support enhanced activity of the alpha subunit of EnNaC (αEnNaC) mediates this aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and associated endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation. There is mounting evidence that diet induced obesity diminishes expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which would be expected to lead to impaired downstream eNOS activation. Thereby, we posited that enhanced EnNaC activation contributes to diet induced obesity related increases in stiffness of the endothelium and diminished NO mediated vascular relaxation by increasing oxidative stress and related inhibition of AMPKα, Sirt1, and associated eNOS inactivation. Sixteen to twenty week-old αEnNaC knockout (αEnNaC<sup>-/-</sup>) and wild type littermate (EnNaC<sup>+/+</sup>) female mice were fed a mouse chow or an obesogenic western diet (WD) containing excess fat (46%) and fructose (17.5%) for 16 weeks. Sodium currents of ECs, endothelial stiffness and NO mediated aortic relaxation were examined along with indices of aortic oxidative stress, vascular remodeling and fibrosis. Enhanced EnNaC activation-mediated WD-induced increases in sodium currents in isolated lung ECs, increased endothelial stiffness and impaired aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (10<sup>-9</sup>-10<sup>-4</sup> mol/L). These abnormalities occurred in conjunction with WD-mediated aortic tissue oxidative stress, inflammation, and decreased activation of AMPKα, Sirt1, and downstream eNOS were substantially mitigated in αEnNaC<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Importantly, αEnNaC<sup>-/-</sup> prevented WD induced increases in endothelial stiffness and related impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation as well as aortic fibrosis and remodeling. However, EnNaC signaling was not involved in diet-induced abnormal expression of adipokines and CYP11b2 in abdominal aortic perivascular adipose tissue. These data suggest that endothelial specific EnNaC activation mediates WD-induced endothelial stiffness, impaired eNOS activation, aortic fibrosis and remodeling through increased aortic oxidative stress and increased inflammation related to a reduction of AMPKα and Sirt 1 mediated eNOS phosphorylation/activation and NO production.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187370] An improved route to the indolequinone pharmacophore is described based on the reaction of bromobenzoquinones with enamines. Through the implementation of small changes in the reaction conditions, the reaction conditions were much improved with quantities of copper salt, base, and acetonitrile solvent all reduced compared with the original method. The resulting indolequinone-3-carboxylates were subsequently converted into novel indolequinones as potential inhibitors of the quinone reductase enzyme NQO2. A number of potent, mechanism-based inhibitors were identified, increasing our understanding of structure-activity relationships for inhibition of this enzyme.

[PMID: 41187369] Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with limited and often toxic treatment options. This study explores the antileishmanial potential of N-substituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridine derivatives through combined in vitro and in silico approaches. Initially, N-Boc-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine (2a-i) and N-Boc-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine (1a-f) derivatives were synthesized and evaluated against Leishmania amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. infantum, and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Only N-Boc-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine derivatives with substituted nitrogen at position 6 (2b, 2c, 2f, 2g) were active (IC₅₀ < 10 μM). Based on this, a series of N-benzyl-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine analogs (3a-i) was synthesized, with compounds 3c, 3f, and 3g showing improved antipromastigote activity and selectivity índices (SI). Notably, compound 3f demonstrated potent amastigote activities (IC₅₀ between 0.83 and 1.13 μM), comparable to amphotericin B, but with a 250-fold higher SI and low in vivo toxicity (LD₅₀ = 2000 mg/kg in Zophobas morio). Physicochemical and pharmacokinetic predictions using SwissADME and Osiris indicated favorable drug-like properties and oral bioavailability for 3f. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed strong binding affinities to Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase (NDK) (PDB: 5GO1), Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) (PDB: 4WZH), and Sterol 14α-Demethylase (CYP51) (PDB: 3L4D), surpassing reference ligands, with stable complexes, key catalytic site interactions, low RMSD, compact Radius of gyration, and reduced RMSF, supporting their potential as conformationally stable and specific enzyme inhibitors for leishmaniasis treatment. Altogether, these findings strongly highlight the potential of N-substituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridine as promising scaffolds for antileishmanial drug development and highlight compound 3f as a lead candidate for further optimization.

[PMID: 41187366] The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, primarily through mechanisms involving carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Aberrant FGFR1 signalling has been implicated in various cancers, including lung, breast, neck and urothelial carcinoma. Despite the recognized oncogenic potential of FGFR1, therapeutic strategies targeting its kinase domain remain inadequately explored. This underscores an urgent need for the development of novel FGFR1 inhibitors, particularly through de novo drug design approaches, to effectively counteract FGFR1-driven malignancies. This research aims to develop novel FGFR1 inhibitors through a multi-step approach involving fragment-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and density functional theory studies (DFT), with the goal of targeting FGFR1's kinase binding domain to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Initially, known FGFR inhibitor molecules were retrieved and subjected to fragment-based drug designing and virtual screening. Through thorough analysis, molecules containing the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold were identified as promising candidates. A pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based database containing 90,952 molecules was subsequently retrieved from PubChem and filtered using molecular docking-based virtual screening resulting 94 molecules having better binding affinity than derazantinib, reference drug. After pharmacokinetic profiling (ADME), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) studies, out of 94 molecules only 11 compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and superior MM-GBSA binding free energies were selected. Docking-based screening revealed that selected 11 compounds demonstrated better binding scores than the reference drug, derazantinib. Among them, HIT1, was selected for 150ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess its conformational stability. DFT calculations further confirmed its bio-feasibility by analyzing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Overall, the selected lead compounds exhibited enhanced binding affinity, superior conformational stability, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to derazantinib. Present findings suggest that the identified hit molecules hold strong potential for inhibiting FGFR1's kinase domain and disrupting FGFR-associated tumor angiogenesis.

[PMID: 41187365] Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) as one of the most important fields of chemometrics provides useful information in pharmaceutical chemistry, drug design, toxicology, and other related areas. In this study, a QSAR model was developed employing image pixels of molecular structure as descriptors to describe the antibacterial activity of pleuromutilin derivatives. Accordingly, a dataset of 54 Pleuromutilin derivatives was collected from the literature, plotted, and transformed into pixels using MATLAB software to generate the desired model. The data were pre-processed through mean-centering and scaling to optimize pixel selection. The suitable descriptors were then extracted using principal component analysis (PCA) and the final model was built followed by partial least squares (PLS) multivariate calibration. The developed QSAR model was validated and novel compounds with antibacterial properties were suggested. In addition, molecular docking studies were utilized to investigate inhibitory activities of proposed new compounds against ribosomal protein (PDB ID: 3G4S). The findings showed high potential of proposed compounds to form strong interactions with key active site residues, confirming their good antibacterial activity and the validity of constructed QSAR model for drug prediction.

[PMID: 41187364] Threat perception is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, shaped by evolutionary pressures and modern environmental demands. While ancestral threats (e.g., snakes) have been shown to elicit stronger neural responses than modern threats (e.g., guns), less is known about how the brain processes airborne threats, such as depictions of individuals wearing face masks. This fMRI study investigates neural responses to ancestral, modern, and airborne threats to identify shared and distinct activation patterns. Sixty participants viewed visual stimuli from the three categories while undergoing fMRI scanning. Results showed heightened activation in the fear-processing network for all affective stimuli. In addition, activation of the ventral attention network was found for the ancestral threats. Modern threats elicited less intense responses, primarily engaging cortical regions associated with context-specific analysis. Notably, airborne threats elicited neural responses of similar intensity to ancestral threats but activated cortical regions overlapping with those for modern threats. This dual pattern highlights the brain's capacity to integrate evolutionary biases with socially constructed threat awareness. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing airborne threats as a unique category of threat processing, with implications for public health and mental well-being.

[PMID: 41187361] To explore the mechanism of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa on the accumulation of γ-glutamyl peptides and taste development in Jinhua ham, the influences of R. mucilaginosa on fungal community structure, functional enzyme gene expression, key enzyme activities, γ-glutamyl peptides accumulation and taste attributes were investigated during the dry-ripening. In comparison with Pichia kudriavzevii XS-5 (PK), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa XZY63-3 (RX) and no inoculation (CK), the inoculation with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa EIODSF019 (RE) showed the highest overall acceptance and richness. Metagenomics revealed that RE inoculation inhibited Aspergillus abundance, and the profile of Rhodotorula reached 45.94 % at genus level. The treatment of RE increased the gene abundance of amino acid metabolism pathways; the expression levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase gene in RE were increased by 83.27 % compared with CK, and the activities of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase increased from 214 U/g proteins of CK to 567 U/g proteins of RE. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the total contents of γ-glutamyl peptides increased from 136.40 μg/g of CK to 518.18 μg/g of RE. Partial least squares regression and correlation analysis indicated that γ-Glu-Cys and γ-Glu-Gln were mainly responsible for the improvement of overall acceptance and richness of Jinhua ham with RE inoculation.

[PMID: 41187356] Accurate and sensitive detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is essential for ensuring food safety. In this study, a nanozyme-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor was developed through a triple signal amplification strategy. A hollow-structured h-CdS coupled with TiO<sub>2</sub> formed a highly efficient heterojunction that enhanced light absorption, light scattering, and charge separation, resulting in significantly improved photoelectric conversion efficiency. A single-atom Fe-MNC nanozyme possessing both peroxidase- and oxidase-like activities was synthesized via a cascade anchoring strategy, successfully catalyzing a biocatalytic precipitation (BCP) reaction for signal amplification. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validated the energy band structure of the heterojunction and the catalytic superiority of Fe-MNC. Additionally, a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) was rationally designed based on the AFB1 aptamer to achieve target-specific recognition and probe amplification. By integrating these three synergistic elements, the constructed nanozyme-based PEC aptasensor enabled highly sensitive detection of AFB1 with a detection limit of 2.04 fg/mL and a linear range from 0.005 to 100 pg/mL. The sensor demonstrated excellent stability and selectivity and showed good agreement with HPLC results when applied to real sample analysis, highlighting its practical potential for food safety monitoring.

The target circRNA-DNA3 binary structure can hybridize competitively with DNA2 in triple helix molecular to generate three-way junction probe, and Exo Ⅲ specifically cleaves DNA2 to release the circRNA-DNA3 binary complex for signal cyclic amplification. Then, Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanospheres are introduced into PEC platform, leading to the switching from anodic to cathodic photocurrents. Interestingly, biotin can competitively bind to Cu<sub>2</sub>O-SA, making the ITO/CdS/T-COF/CS/DNA1 electrode reusable for circRNA analysis. The built PEC biosensor exhibits a low detection limit (7.6 aM), excellent selectivity and satisfactory renewability. Moreover, the developed PEC biosensor for human whole blood circSATB2 assay can effectively distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Importantly, the machine learning is adopted to explore the potential pattern hidden in PEC data, and the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of circRNA intelligent diagnosis all reach 100 %. Machine learning-assisted renewable polarity-switchable PEC biosensor provides a new approach for circRNA analysis and early intelligent diagnosis of cancer.",10
ART substantially reduces infectiveness of HIV-positive people.,ART AND HIV AND transmission reduction AND HIV infectivity,"41113330,41074017,41063233,40952006,40904280,40859302,40820689,40670534,40666737,40642734","[PMID: 41113330] Peer support provided by ""mentor mothers"" (MM) may increase retention in care for pregnant and breastfeeding women (PBFW) living with HIV, which can lead to improved viral suppression and prevention of vertical transmission (PVT). The impact of MM on PVT may differ among PBFW subpopulations with different baseline risks of antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption. We used a microsimulation model of HIV progression and care for PBFW living with recently acquired HIV in Kenya to evaluate an MM program that reduced the cumulative risk of ART interruption between initiation of antenatal care and 18 months of postpartum breastfeeding by 40%. We conducted this evaluation in 2 maternal populations: (1) newly positive (NP) pregnant women who initiate ART during antenatal care and are at greater risk of ART interruption and (2) known positive (KP) women who initiate ART prior to conception. We simulated live births, maternal deaths, and vertical transmission with and without MM services to determine the impact of MM. In the absence of MM services, infants acquired HIV at a rate of 609 vs. 459 per 10,000 live births in the NP vs. KP populations. MM services reduced vertical transmission by 15.1% among NP women, compared to a 6.5% reduction among KP women. MM services can reduce vertical transmission among PBFW living with HIV, with greater potential for PVT among NP women compared to KP women. More research evaluating MM programs in these 2 maternal populations will help refine estimates of their PVT impact.

[PMID: 41074017] New Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among adults have decreased in the last ten years in high HIV prevalent countries. However, unsuppressed individuals with high-risk sexual practices can play a key role in transmitting HIV and maintaining the HIV epidemic. We assessed the association between sexual behavior, HIV awareness, antiretroviral therapy (ART) intake and viral suppression, and the age-gender groups most at risk of maintaining HIV transmission in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey including adolescents and adults aged 15 years and above from August to December 2018 in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In this analysis we included only data from HIV-positive participants aged 15-59 years.In total, 862 HIV-positive individuals aged 15-59 years were included, 76.2% (657) were women, and the median age was 36 [IQR 29-46] years, 10.1% (95%CI 8.2-12.3) were unaware of their HIV status, 15.8% (95%CI 13.4-18.2) not on ART, and 16.3% (95%CI 13.9-18.9) virally unsuppressed. Among the 671 participants who had sexual intercourse in the preceding year, 46.9% (315) consistently used condoms. Among those who provided information on the number of sexual partners, 7.5% (64/856) reported more than one. Overall, 10.6% (88/831) (95%CI 8.7-12.9) of HIV-positive participants were either at high or very high risk of sexually transmitting HIV. Of these, 42.0% (37/88) (95%CI 32.1-52.7) were women aged 20-34 years, 39.8% (35/88) (95%CI 30.0-50.4) were men aged 20-59 years, 50.0% (44/88) (95%CI 39.6-60.4) were unaware of their HIV-positive status and 76.1% (67/88) (95%CI 66.0-84.0) were not on ART. Within the 2.3% (95%CI 1.5-3.6) individuals at very high risk of HIV transmission (19 individuals virally unsuppressed with more than one partner and inconsistent condom use), 68.4% (13/19) (95%CI 43.4-85.9) were men aged 20 to 59 years, 52.6% (10/19) (95%CI 29.7-74.5) were unaware of their HIV- positive status, and 78.9% (15/19) (95%CI 53.5-92.4) were untreated.Efforts and age-gender targeted interventions to increase HIV diagnosis and HIV-positivity awareness, detect early ART treatment failure, provide enhanced adherence support and second- or third-line ART, as well as promote behavioral-risk reduction interventions, are needed to reduce the pool of individuals at high-risk of transmitting HIV.

[PMID: 41063233] This study examines the prevalence of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Mizoram, Northeast India, with a focus on age-group transmission routes and gender-specific prevalence. According to data from the ART Plus Centre at Civil Hospital Aizawl (January-December 2023), men were more likely to be infected with HIV, with the 26-35 age group being the most affected. Heterosexual transmission and intravenous drug use (IDU) were shown to be the most common modes of transmission. Gender and age variations were identified by statistical analysis using SPSS<sup>®</sup> (V 27.0), highlighting the need for focused interventions. To effectively combat the HIV epidemic in this area, gender-specific policies, harm reduction strategies, and stigma reduction measures are essential.

[PMID: 40952006] In the era of 'Undetectable = Untransmittable' (U=U), reductions in condom use and increases in casual partnerships may contribute to elevated risks of coinfection with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV super-infections among men living with HIV. These trends may reflect a shift in personal attitudes towards sexual behaviour and HIV risk, yet their influence on actual behaviours remains unclear. To investigate how changes in personal attitudes and safe sex self-efficacy influence sexual decision-making. Two-wave longitudinal study design. We conducted a 3-month longitudinal study from March to December 2023 among HIV-positive men (≥ 18 years) initiating ART in Changsha, China. Cross-lagged panel analysis and half-longitudinal mediation analysis were used to examine how changes in personal attitudes influenced sexual behaviours. 427 men living with HIV were included at baseline, and 301 completed the follow-up survey. Sexual behaviours were associated with personal attitudes, namely safe sex fatigue, viral load/transmission beliefs, and sexual sensation seeking. More positive personal attitudes in these domains at baseline predicted lower safe sex self-efficacy over 3 months, while reduced baseline self-efficacy increased the likelihood of engaging in condomless sex and/or multiple sexual partners. All three personal attitude domains had significant indirect effects on sexual behaviours via safe sex self-efficacy. In the era of U=U, the changed personal attitudes among men living with HIV may lead to the increased likelihood of engaging in condomless sex and/or having multiple sexual partners, and safe sex self-efficacy serves as a mediator in this relationship. This study highlights the potential influence of attitudinal changes on sexual behaviours among men living with HIV in the 'U=U' era. Findings provide valuable evidence for developing more targeted interventions that address not only behavioural outcomes but also underlying personal attitudes. No patient or public contribution.

[PMID: 40904280] Beginning in late January 2025, Stop-Work orders and contract cancellations have disrupted HIV programmes supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). We assessed the effects on HIV service delivery in four African countries. Weekly aggregate HIV services data from a convenience sample of 165 Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-funded, ICAP-supported facilities-22 in Angola, 75 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 20 in South Sudan and 48 in Zambia-were analysed. We compared data from pre-Stop-Work (7 October 2024-23 January 2025), Stop-Work (24 January 2025-11 February 2025) and post-resumption (12 February 2025-31 March 2025) phases. We examined the number of individuals: (1) who tested for HIV; (2) receiving index testing; (3) had HIV-positive results/yield; (4) initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART); as well as (5) number of pregnant women with known HIV status; and (6) number of HIV-exposed infants who received early infant diagnosis (EID) testing. We used phase-specific weekly averages, relative percentage changes across phases and linear trend tests to measure the magnitude of disruptions and recovery. In Angola, DRC and Zambia, significant declines in number of HIV-positive tests (-58%, -34%, -17%) and ART initiations (-16%, -32%, -17%) were observed across the three phases with limited recovery in number of positive tests in Zambia and ART initiations in Angola. In DRC and Zambia, HIV testing (-33%, -35%), including index testing (-37%, -72%), significantly declined; additionally, HIV testing of pregnant women significantly declined (-28%) in DRC. In Angola and Zambia, EID testing declined (-12%, -18%) with limited recovery. In Angola, HIV testing (2476→2205→2519), including testing for pregnant women (280→ 233→ 287), rebounded in the post-resumption phase; in DRC, EID (6.5→6.3→7.9) rebounded. There were increases in HIV testing yield in Zambia (2.8%→3.1%→4.0%) and index testing (20→24→36) in Angola. No reductions were observed in South Sudan. Stop-Work orders and award terminations have resulted in substantial short-term reductions in the delivery of HIV testing and treatment services. Long-term funding disruptions necessitate careful planning, realistic timelines and investment in cost-effective service models to sustain the gains and maintain the momentum in the global HIV response.

[PMID: 40859302] Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced perinatal HIV transmission, leading to a growing population of children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected (CHEU). While the neuroanatomic developmental impacts of in utero HIV and ART exposure have been studied in young children, long-term effects on school-aged children are poorly understood, prompting this investigation. Fifty-eight CHEU and 38 children who are HIV-unexposed, uninfected (CHUU), 6-12 years old, were recruited through hospitals and community groups in Ontario, Canada. From T1-weighted magnetic resonance images, volume, cortical thickness, and gray-/white-matter tissue volume were extracted. Multiple linear regression models controlling for sex, age, household income, and total brain volume were fit to assess differences by in utero HIV exposure, with additional sex-stratified analyses to uncover sex-specific effects. Compared with CHUU, CHEU showed total brain volumes that were significantly smaller by 49.7cm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI [- 95.66, - 3.67]) and cortices thinner by 0.08 mm (95% CI [- 0.13, - 0.02]). In male CHEU, three regions displayed volumetric age-exposure interactions: the bilateral pars opercularis at 0.36 cm<sup>3</sup>/year (95% CI [0.10, 0.62]), left rolandic operculum at 0.22 cm<sup>3</sup>/year (95% CI [0.04, 0.39]) and left precentral gyrus at 0.71 cm<sup>3</sup>/year (95% CI [0.22, 1.21]), suggesting delayed maturation in those regions. Bilateral frontal lobe cortical thickness was reduced by 0.07 mm in CHEU (95% CI [- 0.14, - 0.006]), most pronounced in the left orbital middle frontal gyrus with a reduction of 0.20 mm among male CHEU (95% CI [- 0.32, - 0.07]). An age-exposure interaction of 0.06 cm<sup>3</sup>/year in bilateral amygdala volume (95% CI [- 0.11, - 0.01]) suggested reduced growth or altered developmental trajectory among CHEU, whereas male CHEU showed bilateral hippocampal volumes diminished by 0.21 cm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI [- 0.40, - 0.01]). These findings suggest that in utero HIV and ART exposure have broad neuroanatomic developmental impacts, particularly in boys, with significant differences in brain regions critical for motor function, expressive language, memory, and emotion. These structural differences align with previously reported motor and language deficits and highlight the importance of early intervention and tailored support strategies for CHEU.

[PMID: 40820689] The evidence on risk compensation due to antiretroviral treatment (ART) use for people, who inject drugs (PWID), is limited. Moreover, interventions, including ART administration, frequently have spill-over effects, i.e., individuals who were not exposed themselves possibly benefit from their connections to those who were exposed. This work aimed to evaluate the causal effects in the presence of spill-over of ART uptake on sharing injecting equipment. Data were obtained from the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project, a network-based intervention among PWID in 2013-2015 in Athens, Greece. An inverse probability weighted estimator (IPWE) was used to assess spill-over effects. The analysis included 218 individuals, with 17% of them being on ART, corresponding to 32% of those living with HIV. The adjusted estimated risk differences (RD) between those on ART and those without ART (direct effects) ranged from 0.105 to 0.155 and were not statistically significant. Comparing participants, who did not receive ART across different levels of ART exposure among their first-degree contacts in the network (spill-over effects), the estimated RDs indicated a protective but not statistically significant spill-over effect of ART. The analyses of PWID-related network data, using a novel estimator, detected no statistically significant effects of ART on sharing injection equipment.

[PMID: 40670534] A third of women who initiate or continue antiretroviral (ARV) treatment during pregnancy are lost- to- follow-up (LTFU) within six months in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinical trials of long acting injectable Antiretroviral Therapy (LA-ART) are ongoing, including for pregnant women. The study explored women's acceptability and attitudes towards- the use of potentially discreet LA-ART in Uganda for Prevention of Vertical Transmission Program (PVT). Understanding women's perspectives of LA-ART before its introduction is critical in answering questions about acceptability and identifying interventions for future implementation and uptake. In May 2022, we purposively selected participants for eight focus group discussions (FGDs) in 5 health facilities in Kampala: 5 with retained mothers and 3 with disengaged mothers from the PVT. A woman was categorized as retained if she had at least one clinic encounter within her last visit. A total of two in-depth interviews were conducted with disengaged mothers. Luganda, the most widely spoken language in Kampala was used to conduct the FGDs and interviews. Recordings were transcribed and translated into English. Themes were mapped onto some components of the health belief model. NVivo version 14 software was used for data management. A thematic approach was used for analysis and a team-based approach was utilized. The data realized three broad themes (1) Perceived benefits from the use of the LA-ART like emotional relief from daily drugs, effective viral load suppression, reduction on stigma and discrimination, reduction of LTFU, (2) potential threats to rollout due to fear of side-effects from monthly injections, drug stock outs, the cost of LA-ART, myths about LA-ART that it cures HIV and (3) Approaches to increase access to LA-ART like prior investigations, providing bridging treatments and use peer-peer approaches. Most women in this study appeared to have positive attitudes towards the rollout of the LA-ART. LA-ART is a potential solution to LTFU which could improve retention in care for women living with HIV. To optimize the acceptability, health programs should ensure strengthened counseling and create awareness of LA-ART and use of peer- peer approaches with expert women using educational initiatives to raise awareness among other women.

[PMID: 40666737] Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. The virus disrupts maternal-fetal immunity through immune dysregulation, placental barrier impairment, and altered antibody transfer, thereby increasing the risk of vertical transmission. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the immunological and clinical factors influencing MTCT. It highlights how maternal immune exhaustion, placental inflammation, and suboptimal ART timing contribute to transmission. While widespread use of ART has reduced MTCT rates, persistent challenges include late ART initiation, HIV drug resistance, co-infections, and transmission through breastfeeding. Emerging strategies-such as maternal immune modulation, monoclonal antibody therapies, and tailored ART regimens-show potential for further risk reduction. To effectively minimize MTCT, comprehensive prevention approaches are essential. These should combine medical interventions with maternal nutrition support, co-infection management, and safe breastfeeding practices under ART coverage. A multifaceted strategy is key to protecting both maternal and infant health.

[PMID: 40642734] People who inject drugs (PWID) face a significantly higher risk of HIV infection than the general population. Effective prevention for this group depends on combining several strategies: needle and syringe programs (NSPs), opioid agonist therapy (OAT), antiretroviral therapy (ART), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), overdose prevention, and changes to structural and policy environments. This narrative review draws on evidence published between 2000 and 2024, including systematic reviews, clinical trials, surveillance reports, and global health guidelines. Programs that offer high coverage of NSPs and OAT have consistently been shown to reduce HIV incidence. ART helps lower viral load and prevents transmission, while both daily and long-acting PrEP offer additional protection for those at risk. However, access remains limited, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, due to criminalization, stigma, and a lack of investment in harm reduction services. Outcomes vary widely by region. In places like Portugal and Canada, where policies support decriminalization and integrate harm reduction into routine care, HIV incidence among PWID has dropped significantly. In contrast, countries that maintain punitive drug laws, such as Russia, continue to struggle with sustained epidemics. Reducing HIV transmission in this population will require expanding access to proven interventions, integrating services more effectively, and reforming policies that act as barriers to care. Priorities moving forward include scaling up NSP and OAT, addressing gender-based inequities, reducing stigma, and aligning national policies with international harm reduction standards.",10

We analyzed its impact in vitro on CDK5 expression and activity, cell survival, apoptosis and cell cycle. DNA damage was analyzed using the expression of γH2A.X and phosphorylated ATM. Its tolerance and efficacy were assessed on in vivo xenograft mouse models. We showed that TP5 decreased the activity but not the expression of CDK5 and p35. TP5 alone impaired cell viability and colony formation of glioblastoma cell lines and induced apoptosis. TP5 increased DNA damage by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ATM, leading to G1 arrest. Whereas CDK5 activity is increased by DNA-damaging agents such as temozolomide and irradiation, TP5 was synergistic with either temozolomide or irradiation due to an accumulation of DNA damage. Concomitant use of TP5 and either temozolomide or irradiation reduced the phosphorylation of ATM, increased DNA damage, and inhibited the G2/M arrest induced by temozolomide or irradiation. TP5 alone suppressed the tumor growth of orthotopic glioblastoma mouse model. The treatment was well tolerated. Finally, alone or in association with irradiation or temozolomide, TP5 prolonged mouse survival. TP5 alone or in association with temozolomide and radiotherapy is a promising therapeutic option for glioblastoma.

[PMID: 28477132] The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) plays a central role in coordinating the DNA damage responses including cell cycle checkpoint control, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Mutations of ATM cause a spectrum of defects ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer predisposition. We previously showed that Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) is activated by DNA damage and directly phosphorylates ATM at serine 794 in postmitotic neurons. Phosphorylation at serine 794 precedes and is required for ATM autophosphorylation at serine 1981, and activates ATM kinase activity. Cdk5-ATM pathway plays a crucial role in DNA damage-induced neuronal injury. This chapter describes protocols used in analyzing ATM phosphorylation by Cdk5 in CGNs (cerebellar granule neurons) and its effects on neuronal survival.

[PMID: 25928429] Previous study revealed that the protective effect of TIGAR in cell survival is mediated through the increase in PPP (pentose phosphate pathway) flux. However, it remains unexplored if TIGAR plays an important role in DNA damage and repair. This study investigated the role of TIGAR in DNA damage response (DDR) induced by genotoxic drugs and hypoxia in tumor cells. Results showed that TIGAR was increased and relocated to the nucleus after epirubicin or hypoxia treatment in cancer cells. Knockdown of TIGAR exacerbated DNA damage and the effects were partly reversed by the supplementation of PPP products NADPH, ribose, or the ROS scavenger NAC. Further studies with pharmacological and genetic approaches revealed that TIGAR regulated the phosphorylation of ATM, a key protein in DDR, through Cdk5. The Cdk5-AMT signal pathway involved in regulation of DDR by TIGAR defines a new role of TIGAR in cancer cell survival and it suggests that TIGAR may be a therapeutic target for cancers.

[PMID: 21878640] DNA damage response (DDR) is vital for genomic stability, and its deficiency is linked to tumorigenesis. Extensive studies in interphase (G(1)-S-G(2)) mammalian cells have revealed the mechanisms of DDR in great detail; however, how mitotic cells respond to DNA damage remains less defined. We report here that a full DDR is suppressed in mitotic mammalian cells until telophase/cytokinesis. Although early DDR markers such as the phosphorylations of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and histone H2A.x (H2AX) can be readily detected, the ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) formation of late DDR markers such as breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) are absent until the telophase/cytokinesis stage. We further showed that the IR-induced ubiquitination cascade around DNA damage sites did not occur in mitotic cells, which explains, at least in part, why BRCA1 and 53BP1 cannot be recruited to the damaged sites. These observations indicate that DDR is suppressed in mitotic cells after the step of γH2AX formation. Not surprisingly, we found that the absence of a full DDR in mitotic cells was associated with the high cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activities. More 53BP1 IRIF could be detected when the irradiated mitotic cells were treated with a CDK1 inhibitor. Further, the activation of CDK5 in interphase cells impedes the formation of 53BP1 IRIF. Together, these results suggest that the DDR is suppressed by the high CDK1 activity in mitotic mammalian cells.

[PMID: 19151707] The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has a central role in coordinating DNA damage responses, including cell-cycle checkpoint control, DNA repair and apoptosis. Mutations of ATM cause a spectrum of defects ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer predisposition. However, the mechanism by which DNA damage activates ATM is poorly understood. Here we show that Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5), activated by DNA damage, directly phosphorylates ATM at Ser 794 in post-mitotic neurons. Phosphorylation at Ser 794 precedes, and is required for, ATM autophosphorylation at Ser 1981, and activates ATM kinase activity. The Cdk5-ATM signal regulates phosphorylation and function of the ATM targets p53 and H2AX. Interruption of the Cdk5-ATM pathway attenuates DNA-damage-induced neuronal cell cycle re-entry and expression of the p53 targets PUMA and Bax, protecting neurons from death. Thus, activation of Cdk5 by DNA damage serves as a critical signal to initiate the ATM response and regulate ATM-dependent cellular processes.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187334] Hexokinase domain containing protein 1 (HKDC1) is a recently discovered fifth human hexokinase isozyme that is significantly upregulated in several disease states, including lung and liver cancers. Cellular studies suggest that HKDC1 is a low activity hexokinase; however, its functional characteristics have remained enigmatic. Here, we describe the kinetic and regulatory features of recombinant human HKDC1, demonstrating it to be a robust hexokinase (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub> = 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) with a unique glucose <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value (0.49 ± 0.07 mM) that differs markedly from all other human hexokinase isozymes. The isolated C-terminal domain of HKDC1 displays kinetic characteristics nearly identical to the full-length enzyme, whereas the N-terminal domain is inactive. Unlike all other 100 kDa vertebrate hexokinases characterized to date, HKDC1 is insensitive to product inhibition by physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate, with apparent inhibition constants above 1 mM. The hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is also insensitive to Dinaciclib, a pan cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that reportedly disrupts the ability of nuclear localized HKDC1 to phosphorylate retinoblastoma-binding protein 5. Conversely, the hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is potently inhibited by a synthetic glucosamine derivative previously developed for hexokinase 1 and 2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 103 ± 6 nM. An HKDC1 variant associated with retinitis pigmentosa, T58M, displays a modest, but statistically significant 2-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub>) compared to the wild-type enzyme. Together, our results provide a detailed functional characterization of recombinant HKDC1 and set the stage for investigating the link between HKDC1 catalysis and human disease.

[PMID: 41187089] Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling plays a crucial role in plant immunity, regulating both pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) through cell-surface receptors and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) via intracellular nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs). Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs/CDPKs) serve as key Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors and signal transducers in these processes. In this study, we demonstrate the relevance of two rice CPKs, OsCPK5 and OsCPK13, for rice blast resistance. Both are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive kinases, with potential in planta heteromer formation enhancing their phosphorylation/signaling functions. Single <i>oscpk5</i> and <i>oscpk13</i> mutants exhibit impaired early PTI responses and enhanced susceptibility to rice blast fungus, suggesting that these kinases are essential for effective immunity. Surprisingly, although it is also defective in PTI, the <i>oscpk5</i>/<i>13</i> double mutant displays enhanced resistance to rice blast. An NLR protein OsCPK5/13-ASSOCIATING RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1 (OsCARP1), which is physically associated with both OsCPK5 and OsCPK13, is genetically required for the heightened resistance of <i>oscpk5</i>/<i>13.</i> Furthermore, OsCARP1-induced cell death in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> can be suppressed by the expression of OsCPK5 and OsCPK13. Based on these findings, we postulate that the positive blast resistance roles of OsCPK5 and OsCPK13 are guarded by OsCARP1, thus leading to OsCARP1-dependent ETI resistance in the <i>oscpk5</i>/<i>13</i> double mutant or upon manipulation by still unknown pathogen effectors during infection. Our results offer insights into how plants counteract potential pathogen attack on key Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling immune components.

[PMID: 41187062] While neuronal activity is essential for brain function, it also poses threats to neuronal integrity. Here, we show that activity-induced expression of stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) protects neurons from degeneration. Previously considered germline specific, Stra8 is expressed in the adult mouse brain and is induced by neuronal activity via calcium influx and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling. Neuron-specific Stra8 knockout mice display hallmark features of neurodegeneration, including DNA damage, impaired proteostasis, inflammation, nuclear envelope erosion, reduced dendritic plasticity, memory deficits, and heightened excitotoxic vulnerability. Electrophysiological studies reveal disrupted inhibitory circuit function. Mechanistically, Stra8 binds regulatory regions of neuromodulator genes and regulates their expression. Notably, Stra8 loss upregulates the expression of Npas4, an immediate-early gene critical for inhibitory circuits, but the aberrant protein is mislocalized to the nuclear periphery. These findings identify Stra8 as an activity-dependent transcriptional regulator that safeguards neuronal structure and function.

[PMID: 41186919] Protein phosphorylation is one of the most critical post-translational modifications for regulating protein activity and function. Direct mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of phosphopeptides presents significant challenges due to their inherently low abundance and the inefficient ionization characteristics. In this study, we report the design of a novel pH-responsive magnetic adsorbent, denoted as Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@NH<sub>2</sub>@Rb, for highly selective capture of phosphopeptides. This innovative material leverages dynamic and reversible electrostatic interactions between bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Bis) and rhodamine B (Rb), which are responsive to pH changes. Under acidic conditions, Bis undergoes protonation while Rb transforms into a ring-opening zwitterionic form. The rapid and reversible transformation of Bis and Rb facilitates the efficient adsorption under acidic conditions and elution in alkaline environments.

Activated Cdk5 regulates DNA damage-induced neuronal death.,Cdk5 AND regulation AND DNA damage AND neuronal death,"36453392,24936870,24703879,21600237,21057871,19151707,19075597,17611284,17591690,17117479","[PMID: 36453392] Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the progressive loss of specific neurons. The exact mechanisms of action of these diseases are unknown, and many studies have focused on pathways related to abnormal accumulation and processing of proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress leading to apoptotic death. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that aberrant cell cycle re-entry plays a major role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. The activation of the cell cycle in mature neurons could be promoted by several signaling mechanisms, including c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascades; post-translational modifications such as Tau-phosphorylation; and DNA damage response. In all these events, implicated Cdk5, a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase, seems to be responsible for several cellular processes in neurons including axon growth, neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, neuronal migration, and maintenance of neuronal survival. However, under pathological conditions, Cdk5 dysregulation may lead to cell cycle re-entry in post-mitotic neurons. Thus, Cdk5 hyperactivation, by its physiologic activator p25, hyper-phosphorylates downstream substrates related to neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes factors such as oxidative stress, DNA damage response, signaling pathway disturbance, and Ubiquitin proteasome malfunction contributing to cell cycle re-entry in post-mitotic neurons. It also describes how all these factors are linked to a greater or lesser extent with Cdk5. Thus, it offers a global vision of the function of cell cycle-related proteins in mature neurons with a focus on Cdk5 and how this protein contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease by cell cycle activation.

[PMID: 24936870] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline associated with a featured neuropathology (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). Several studies have implicated oxidative damage to DNA, DNA repair, and altered cell-cycle regulation in addition to cell death in AD post-mitotic neurons. However, there is a lack of studies that systematically assess those biological processes in patients with AD neuropathology but with no evidence of cognitive impairment. We evaluated markers of oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG, H2AX), DNA repair (p53, BRCA1, PTEN), and cell-cycle (Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdk5, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, p27Kip1, phospho-Rb and E2F1) through immunohistochemistry and cell death through TUNEL in autopsy hippocampal tissue samples arrayed in a tissue microarray (TMA) composed of three groups: I) ""clinical-pathological AD"" (CP-AD)--subjects with neuropathological AD (Braak ≥ IV and CERAD = B or C) and clinical dementia (CDR ≥ 2, IQCODE>3.8); II) ""pathological AD"" (P-AD)--subjects with neuropathological AD (Braak ≥ IV and CERAD = B or C) and without cognitive impairment (CDR 0, IQCODE<3.2); and III) ""normal aging"" (N)--subjects without neuropathological AD (Braak ≤ II and CERAD 0 or A) and with normal cognitive function (CDR 0, IQCODE<3.2). Our results show that high levels of oxidative DNA damage are present in all groups. However, significant reductions in DNA repair and cell-cycle inhibition markers and increases in cell-cycle progression and cell death markers in subjects with CP-AD were detected when compared to both P-AD and N groups, whereas there were no significant differences in the studied markers between P-AD individuals and N subjects. This study indicates that, even in the setting of pathological AD, healthy cognition may be associated with a preserved repair to DNA damage, cell-cycle regulation, and cell death in post-mitotic neurons.

[PMID: 24703879] DNA damage, which perturbs genomic stability, has been linked to cognitive decline in the aging human brain, and mutations in DNA repair genes have neurological implications. Several studies have suggested that DNA damage is also increased in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the precise mechanisms connecting DNA damage with neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. CDK5, a critical enzyme in the development of the central nervous system, phosphorylates a number of synaptic proteins and regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity and learning. In addition to these physiological roles, CDK5 has been involved in the neuronal death initiated by DNA damage. We hypothesized that p19INK4d, a member of the cell cycle inhibitor family INK4, is involved in a neuroprotective mechanism activated in response to DNA damage. We found that in response to genotoxic injury or increased levels of intracellular calcium, p19INK4d is transcriptionally induced and phosphorylated by CDK5 which provides it with greater stability in postmitotic neurons. p19INK4d expression improves DNA repair, decreases apoptosis and increases neuronal survival under conditions of genotoxic stress. Our in vivo experiments showed that decreased levels of p19INK4d rendered hippocampal neurons more sensitive to genotoxic insult resulting in the loss of cognitive abilities that rely on the integrity of this brain structure. We propose a feedback mechanism by which the neurotoxic effects of CDK5-p25 activated by genotoxic stress or abnormal intracellular calcium levels are counteracted by the induction and stabilization of p19INK4d protein reducing the adverse consequences on brain functions.

[PMID: 21600237] In the central nervous system, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), an unusual member of the Cdk family, is implicated in the regulation of various physiological processes ranging from neuronal survival, migration and differentiation, to synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. Dysregulation of this kinase has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the pathogenic process of neurodegenerative disorders. DNA damage is emerging as an important pathological component in various neurodegenerative conditions. In this review, we discuss the recent progress regarding the regulation and roles of Cdk5 under physiological conditions, and its dysregulation under pathological conditions, especially in neuronal death mediated by DNA damage.

[PMID: 21057871] Recently, it was reported that in a 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model, neuronal cell death is associated with the cdk5-mediated hyperphosphorylation of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), a transcription factor that is critically required for neuronal survival. In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of cdk5-mediated MEF2D down-regulation on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PC12 cell death. 6-OHDA was found to significantly increase nitric oxide (NO) production and to induce apoptosis in a time-dependent manner in PC12 cells. Furthermore, 6-OHDA was found to markedly reduce MEF2D levels under conditions that could induce PC12 cell apoptosis. In addition, PC12 cell death and MEF2D degradation by 6-OHDA were prevented by the cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine, but roscovitine could not restore the 6-OHDA-induced inactivation of Akt. These results suggest that the cell death and MEF2D degradation caused by 6-OHDA are dependent on cdk5 activity. On the other hand, roscovitine enhanced the 6-OHDA-induced activations of ERK1/2 and JNK, but reduced the 6-OHDA-induced activation of p38. These results suggest that PC12 cell death by 6-OHDA appears to be regulated by the down-regulation of MEF2D via some interaction between cdk5 and MAP kinase.

[PMID: 19151707] The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has a central role in coordinating DNA damage responses, including cell-cycle checkpoint control, DNA repair and apoptosis. Mutations of ATM cause a spectrum of defects ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer predisposition. However, the mechanism by which DNA damage activates ATM is poorly understood. Here we show that Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5), activated by DNA damage, directly phosphorylates ATM at Ser 794 in post-mitotic neurons. Phosphorylation at Ser 794 precedes, and is required for, ATM autophosphorylation at Ser 1981, and activates ATM kinase activity. The Cdk5-ATM signal regulates phosphorylation and function of the ATM targets p53 and H2AX. Interruption of the Cdk5-ATM pathway attenuates DNA-damage-induced neuronal cell cycle re-entry and expression of the p53 targets PUMA and Bax, protecting neurons from death. Thus, activation of Cdk5 by DNA damage serves as a critical signal to initiate the ATM response and regulate ATM-dependent cellular processes.

[PMID: 19075597] Neuronal cell specific cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a known regulator of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We report that Cdk5 also plays an important role in the proliferation of breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 and is functionally involved in chemosensitivity as well as in cell death pathways induced by anti-cancer drug carboplatin (Carb). Here, we demonstrate that carboplatin induced Cdk5 activation under positive regulation of ERK, promotes cell death in MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells. DNA-damage stress enhanced ERK activity utilizes Cdk5 as one of its downstream targets for the execution of death signal in carboplatin induced death in MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells. Additionally, present data clearly indicates that activated Cdk5 modulates p53 transactivation in MCF-7 cells. However, in p53 mutant MDA MB-231 cells, Cdk5 mediated cell death is likely to be p53 independent. Collectively, our findings not only draw attention to the extra-neuronal functions of Cdk5 but also propose Cdk5 as a novel and potential therapeutic target of chemotherapeutic drugs.

[PMID: 17611284] Huntingtin is an antiapoptotic protein that becomes toxic when its polyglutamine stretch is expanded, resulting in Huntington's disease (HD). Protein context and posttranslational modifications regulate huntingtin toxicity. Identifying signaling pathways that act on huntingtin is, therefore, key to understanding huntingtin function in normal and pathological conditions. We show here that huntingtin is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at serines 1181 and 1201. Phosphorylation can be induced by DNA damage in vitro and in vivo. The state of huntingtin phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of neuronal cell death. Absence of phosphorylation of huntingtin at serines 1181 and 1201 confers toxic properties to wild-type huntingtin in a p53-dependent manner in striatal neurons and accelerates neuronal death induced by DNA damage. In contrast, phosphorylation at serines 1181 and 1201 protects against polyQ-induced toxicity. Finally, we show in late stages of HD a sustained DNA damage that is associated with a decrease in Cdk5/p35 levels. We propose that wild-type huntingtin is a component of the DNA damage response signal in neurons and that the Cdk5/DNA damage pathway is dysregulated in HD.

[PMID: 17591690] The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a key regulator of cellular functions including responses to numerous stress signals, and triggers apoptosis in many cell types, including neurons. The major mechanisms known to regulate p53 stabilization and activation include phosphorylation and ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, is most active in the central nervous system and plays a variety of roles in neuronal degeneration. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Cdk5 interacts with p53 and increases its stability through posttranslational regulation, leading to accumulation of p53, particularly in the nucleus. We show that Cdk5 phosphorylates p53 on Ser15, Ser33 and Ser46 in vitro, and that increased Cdk5 activity in the nucleus mediates these phosphorylation events in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses. Cdk5 mediates disruption of the interaction between p53 and Hdm2 (also known as Mdm2), and prevents Hdm2-induced p53 ubiquitylation and downregulation. Cdk5 additionally enhances phosphorylation-dependent binding of the p300 coactivator, inducing acetylation of p53. Cdk5-stabilized p53 protein is transcriptionally active, resulting in the induction of pro-apoptotic genes and subsequent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in response to genotoxic or oxidative stress. Collectively, these novel findings help define the mechanisms underlying neuronal apoptosis occurring as a result of Cdk5-mediated p53 stabilization and transcriptional activation.

[PMID: 17117479] DNA damage is known to be an initiator of neuronal death in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The mechanism linking DNA damage and neuronal death is not completely understood. Here, we delineate the mechanism by which neuronal death evoked by DNA damage is controlled. Using mouse cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, we identify a critical role of ERK signaling in neuronal death induced by DNA damage upon mitomycin C treatment. In addition, we provide evidence that the ERK signaling regulates Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity and stability of tumor suppressor p53. Mitomycin C increased expression of p35, a specific activator of neuronal Cdk5 in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. Moreover, stability of p53 was increased by its phosphorylation on Ser33 and Ser46 by Cdk5, leading to neuronal death. Finally, we show that activated ERK induced increased expression of the Egr-1 transcription factor, which then bound to the promoter region of p35. We suggest subsequent increase of p35 expression and Cdk5 activity contribute to p53-dependent neuronal death. Thus, the present finding provides a new insight into a molecular mechanism underlying DNA damage-induced neuronal death.",10
Activation of the Rac1 homolog CED-10 kills viable cells in SRGP-1 mutant Caenorhabditis elegans.,CED-10 AND Rac1 homolog AND C. elegans AND apoptosis,"24625979,11595183,41187268,41187171,41187103,41186893,41186847,41186844,41186842,41186825","[PMID: 24625979] Apoptotic cell death is an integral part of cell turnover in many tissues, and proper corpse clearance is vital to maintaining tissue homeostasis in all multicellular organisms. Even in tissues with high cellular turnover, apoptotic cells are rarely seen because of efficient clearance mechanisms in healthy individuals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, two parallel and partly redundant conserved pathways act in cell corpse engulfment. The pathway for cytoskeletal rearrangement requires the small GTPase CED-10 Rac1 acting for an efficient surround of the dead cell. The CED-10 Rac pathway is also required for the proper migration of the distal tip cells (DTCs) during the development of the C. elegans gonad. Parkin, the mammalian homolog of the C. elegans PDR-1, interacts with Rac1 in aged human brain and it is also implicated with actin dynamics and cytoskeletal rearrangements in Parkinsons's disease, suggesting that it might act on engulfment. Our genetic and biochemical studies indicate that PDR-1 inhibits apoptotic cell engulfment and DTC migration by ubiquitylating CED-10 for degradation.

[PMID: 11595183] The C. elegans genes ced-2, ced-5, and ced-10, and their mammalian homologs crkII, dock180, and rac1, mediate cytoskeletal rearrangements during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and cell motility. Here, we describe an additional member of this signaling pathway, ced-12, and its mammalian homologs, elmo1 and elmo2. In C. elegans, CED-12 is required for engulfment of dying cells and for cell migrations. In mammalian cells, ELMO1 functionally cooperates with CrkII and Dock180 to promote phagocytosis and cell shape changes. CED-12/ELMO-1 binds directly to CED-5/Dock180; this evolutionarily conserved complex stimulates a Rac-GEF, leading to Rac1 activation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. These studies identify CED-12/ELMO as an upstream regulator of Rac1 that affects engulfment and cell migration from C. elegans to mammals.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187171] Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a highly aggressive lung cancer with poor prognosis due to lack of reliable biomarkers. Resistance to anoikis drives tumor progression and metastasis. This study aims to develop and validate an anoikis-related prognostic model for LUAD. We employed univariate Cox regression analysis, LASSO regression, and random forest algorithms to identify anoikis-related genes (ARG) from bulk transcriptomic datasets, and establish a 7-gene prognostic signature, validated in two LUAD cohorts from GEO database. We evaluated immune infiltration, molecular functions, and genomic alterations between risk groups and analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data. IHC and mIF validated TIMP1 expression and its interaction with Treg cells. We developed a 7-gene prognostic model (LDHA, PLK1, TRAF2, ITGB4, SLCO1B3, TIMP1, ZEB2) using machine learning to predict survival in LUAD patients. The model accurately predicted 1-year survival rates (GSE31210: AUC = 0.805; GSE30219: AUC = 0.787), 2-year survival rates (GSE31210: AUC = 0.769; GSE30219: AUC = 0.681), and 3-year survival rates (GSE31210: AUC = 0.695; GSE30219: AUC = 0.735) and correlated with clinical features, immune infiltration, and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling. Single-cell sequencing data showed that LUAD patients exhibited an immunosuppressive TME phenotype, which was exacerbated by high TIMP1 expression in epithelial cells, promoting Treg cell activity. The 7-gene ARG prognostic model established in this study shows promising potential as a clinically applicable tool for decision-making.

[PMID: 41187103] In recent years, the incidence of male infertility has increased to approximately 10%, with a continued upward trend. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying male infertility and developing effective treatment strategies have become essential areas of focus. Mitochondria are regulated by a complex quality control system including mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy and biogenesis, which not only maintains mitochondrial structural and functional integrity, but also supports the stability of testicular tissue and the intracellular environment necessary for male fertility. Several studies have demonstrated that dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy is closely associated with a decline in male fertility. Disruptions caused by excessive external stimuli or gene mutations can impair these processes, resulting in oxidative damage, apoptosis, inflammation, and ferroptosis. These pathological changes ultimately damage testicular cells and tissues. Consequently, this review will focus on the two key mechanisms: mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Furthermore, mitochondrial biogenesis-responsible for producing new mitochondria and regulating the number of mitochondria-also plays an important role in maintaining male fertility. Related studies have shown that mitochondrial biogenesis dysfunction can trigger a cascade of pathological events that lead to testicular tissue damage. In summary, this review systematically examines the roles of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in regulating male fertility. It provides an in-depth analysis of the pathological mechanisms by which dysfunction in these processes leads to male infertility. Additionally, this review summarizes current therapeutic agents targeting mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, aiming to identify potential strategies for the clinical treatment of male infertility.

[PMID: 41186893] Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, with its pathogenesis involving complex biological processes such as DNA damage, epigenetic modification and oncogene mutation. Over the past two decades, the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the occurrence, metastasis and progression of HCC has received increasing attention. As an important noncoding RNA molecule, lncRNAs play a key role in regulating gene expression, affecting RNA transcription and mRNA stability. This review elucidates the potential pathogenic processes of HCC and elaborates on the synthesis mechanisms of the above three non-coding RNAs. It comprehensively summarizes various non-coding RNAs that have been identified as playing key regulatory roles in HCC, as well as how these non-coding RNAs affect disease progression by regulating gene expression and protein functions. For example: lncRNAs such as NEAT1, DSCR8, PNUTS, HULC, and HOTAIR can play different roles in the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HCC cells in different ways. lncRNAs such as HClnc1, LINC01343, FAM111A-DT, CERS6-AS1, and TLNC1 significantly affect the progression of HCC by regulating key signaling axes or protein functions, and are closely related to the prognosis of patients. In addition, we also discuss the potential of lncRNAs as therapeutic targets for HCC, such as: lncRNA MIR31HG, CASC2c, and lncRNA AC115619. Furthermore, we also explore the application prospects of lncRNAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new perspectives and directions for future HCC research.

[PMID: 41186847] Prolonged exposure to Ultraviolet B (UVB) rays increases oxidative stress, causes direct DNA photolesions-particularly cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs)-and activates aging-related signaling pathways, leading to skin photoaging and an increased risk of skin cancer. UVB triggers a cascade of enzymatic reactions, notably through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase), perpetuating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) even after exposure has ceased. While numerous studies have explored antioxidant compounds in ameliorating UVB-induced damage, caffeic acid-phthalimide (CF) stands out not only for its antioxidant potential but also for its hydrophobic nature, UVB absorption capacity, particularly within the range of 300-350 nm, and its ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), a key enzyme in oxidative stress. This dual action-physicochemical absorption of UVB and intracellular antioxidant activity-supports CF's photoprotective potential. Therefore, we investigated the effects and potential mechanisms of CF action on L-929 fibroblasts in response to UVB-induced oxidatively generated damage. Our investigations demonstrated CF's notable antioxidant activity, as evidenced by results from both the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•) and xanthine oxidase (XO) assays. Notably, CF improved the viability of UVB-irradiated L-929 cells and exhibited no cytotoxicity in non-irradiated fibroblasts. CF effectively reduced ROS generation and restored the antioxidant defense system in UVB-irradiated L-929 fibroblasts. Furthermore, CF pre-treatment prevented lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and reduced DNA condensation and apoptosis induced by UVB exposure. CF prevented cell membrane disruption and enhanced the migratory capacity of L-929 fibroblasts. Our study indicates that integrating CF into topical delivery systems holds significant promise as a strategy to counteract UVB-induced oxidatively generated damage in L-929 fibroblasts.

[PMID: 41186844] Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is characterized by pronounced metastatic and invasive properties. Emerging research has elucidated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are intricately associated with the pathogenesis of NPC, potentially serving as critical mechanisms in tumorigenesis and as promising therapeutic targets for NPC. The expression levels of circRNAs were analyzed in NPC using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Wound healing, transwell, and clone formation assays were conducted to examine the metastatic potential of NPC. Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed to evaluate cell proliferation and survival. 3D spheroid cultures, RNA pull-down, LC-MS, RNA-sequencing, and luciferase reporter assays were carried out to examine the mechanisms of circPPP1CB in NPC progression. NPC xenograft tumor models were estimated to verify the mechanisms of circPPP1CB in tumor growth and metastasis of NPC in vivo. CircPPP1CB subtype, hsa_circ_0007439, that was more highly expressed in NPC patients with distant metastasis than in those without distant metastasis. Hsa_circ_0007439 overexpression specifically promotes proliferation and inhibits the apoptosis of NPC cells. Further experiments indicated that hsa_circ_0007439 overexpression was correlated with increased tumor growth and distant metastasis of NPC cells. Mechanistically, hsa_circ_0007439 upregulated KRT1 expression by acting as a sponge for miR-1275 and miR-1293. This led to increased proliferation and metastatic progression in NPC by activating the JAK/STATs signaling pathway. This study is the first to demonstrate that hsa_circ_0007439 functions as a competitive endogenous RNA to upregulate KRT1 expression, thereby promoting the metastasis of NPC, suggesting that hsa_circ_0007439 serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for NPC.

[PMID: 41186842] Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Lenvatinib is a common first-line treatment for advanced HCC. However, resistance to lenvatinib is the greatest challenge limiting its clinical application. Currently, the molecular mechanisms of resistance remain poorly understood. Methods The expression of DDX1 and Ephrin-A3 in lenvatinib-resistant HCC cells was identified via RNA-seq and Western blotting. Bioinformatic analyses were applied to explore its expression and prognostic role. The biological role of DDX1 was evaluated via CCK8, EdU, flow cytometry analyses and xenograft tumor model. The regulation between DDX1 and Ephrin-A3 was determined by mass spectrometry, coimmunoprecipitation, RNA Immunoprecipitation, and RNA stability assay. Results We successfully established lenvatinib-resistant HCC cells. The results of RNA-seq showed DDX1 and Ephrin-A3 were significantly increased in lenvatinib-resistant HCC cells compared to parental cell. The DDX1 expression in HCC tissues is positively associated with worse prognosis. DDX1 knockdown increased the sensitivity of cells to lenvatinib by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, overexpression of DDX1 exhibited the opposite regulation. Moreover, DDX1 bound to Ephrin-A3 and regulated its expression levels. The effects of DDX1 overexpression on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and lenvatinib resistance were significantly blocked by Ephrin-A3 knockdown. Mechanistically, DDX1 promotes lenvatinib resistance in HCC by regulating Ephrin-A3 mRNA stability and activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Conclusion: The increased DDX1 expression in HCC cells promotes lenvatinib resistance via regulating Ephrin-A3 mRNA stability and activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, indicating that targeting DDX1 may be an important strategy for overcoming lenvatinib resistance.

[PMID: 41186825] The autophagy-related structures, the size of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisterns, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins were assessed by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from mice with B16 skin melanoma after administration of autophagy inducer (rapamycin) or ER stress inducer (brefeldin A). Brefeldin A stimulated significant ER stress in mouse skin melanoma cells, but rapamycin contributed to the maintenance of cell homeostasis by inducing autophagy, which was confirmed by the presence of autophagy-related structures and significantly smaller sizes of the rough ER cisterns in the group of mice receiving both rapamycin and brefeldin A. Brefeldin A-induced ER stress triggered apoptosis of tumor cells. Moreover, simultaneous stimulation of autophagy and ER stress in tumor cells promoted cytoprotective selective autophagy (reticulophagy) aimed at resolving ER stress, which may be a mechanism underlying the development of chemoresistance in skin melanoma.",10

Ly49Q, an ITIM domain-bearing receptor expressed on different leukocytes, has been recently reported to impact neutrophil migration and polarization. Utilizing a murine model of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae-</i>induced pulmonary infection in combination with additional in vivo and in vitro assays, we show that Ly49Q is critically involved in different steps of the leukocyte adhesion cascade. Ly49Q deficiency is associated with a reduced rolling velocity, impaired crawling capacity, and diminished transmigration. We show that overactivation of the neutrophil β<sub>2</sub> integrins Mac-1 and LFA-1 is responsible for increased adhesion and reduced neutrophil transmigration, resulting in a strongly impaired immune defense against pulmonary infection. Structure function analysis in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that different domains of Ly49Q are important for its function. In summary, Ly49Q regulates integrin activation and neutrophil recruitment and is required for an adequate immune response in pulmonary infection.

[PMID: 20153219] Neutrophils rapidly undergo polarization and directional movement to infiltrate the sites of infection and inflammation. Here, we show that an inhibitory MHC I receptor, Ly49Q, was crucial for the swift polarization of and tissue infiltration by neutrophils. During the steady state, Ly49Q inhibited neutrophil adhesion by preventing focal-complex formation, likely by inhibiting Src and PI3 kinases. However, in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, Ly49Q mediated rapid neutrophil polarization and tissue infiltration in an ITIM-domain-dependent manner. These opposite functions appeared to be mediated by distinct use of effector phosphatase SHP-1 and SHP-2. Ly49Q-dependent polarization and migration were affected by Ly49Q regulation of membrane raft functions. We propose that Ly49Q is pivotal in switching neutrophils to their polarized morphology and rapid migration upon inflammation, through its spatiotemporal regulation of membrane rafts and raft-associated signaling molecules.

[PMID: 41187293] Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fatal disease. Current clinically approved treatments slow disease progression but are not curative. Thus, there is a critical need to better define the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF and develop novel approaches to treat this devastating lung condition. Immune dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, accompanied by fibrosis, constitutes a key hallmark of IPF. IPF is generally considered to be a fibroproliferative disorder rather than an immune condition because, historically, immunomodulatory therapies have failed to produce significant clinical effect. This lack of response is frustrating given that there is evidence of immune dysfunction in IPF and highlights the need to clarify the role of immune cells and inflammatory pathways in IPF. There is increasing evidence that the extracellular matrix (ECM) directs cell fate and function, and we propose that ECM remodeling and immune dysfunction in IPF generate a self-perpetuating fibrotic circuit that is refractory to classical anti-inflammatory agents. Understanding the relationship between ECM and immune dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis could help identify novel therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease.

[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187197] The type I interferon (IFN-I) response, which includes IFN-I induction and signaling, plays an important role in a host's defence against viral infections. Many pathogenic viruses target it to evade the host immunity. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), the causative agent of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, which features high mortality in humans, has been reported in southeastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Although a previous study reported that CCHFV antagonizes IFN-I signaling in human cell lines, it is unclear how it inhibits IFN-I signaling. Here we demonstrated that the non-structural protein of CCHFV, NSm, suppresses IFN-I signaling in human cell lines. Furthermore, we discovered that NSm binds to STAT2, an important host protein in IFN-I signaling, and induces its degradation within cells. Taken together, our results imply that NSm suppresses IFN-I signaling by targeting human STAT2.

[PMID: 41187192] This study aimed to assess tetanus seropositivity levels among adult patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital following rabies risk exposure, and to explore potential factors influencing their immunological status. This cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study included 182 adult individuals (68 females and 114 males) who presented to the hospital following rabies risk exposure. The demographic data was collected during a face-to-face interview, and the tetanus antibody concentrations were assessed using a micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Serum antibody levels of ≥ 0.1 IU/mL were defined as ""seropositive"", while values below this threshold were considered ""seronegative"". Seropositivity was identified in 81.9% of the patients. There was a significant decline in antibody levels with age (p < 0.001). The Spearman correlation analysis showed a moderately significant negative correlation between age and antibody titers (r = - 0.404, p < 0.001). In addition, there were significantly higher tetanus antibody levels in patients from urban areas, those vaccinated during pregnancy, and those vaccinated within the past 10 years (p = 0.025, 0.036, and 0.013, respectively). Overall, the results highlight a reduction in tetanus antibody levels with age, emphasizing the importance of receiving a booster dose every 10 years. In addition, rabies risk exposure, particularly in older adults, presents a valuable opportunity to administer tetanus vaccination.

[PMID: 41187159] Adolescent opioid use in the United States commands attention: millions of twelve- to nineteen-year-olds are exposed to opioids each year by prescription and misuse. Recent findings show that opioids bind not only to canonical opioid receptors but also interact with receptors on immune cells within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The potential for early life opioid exposure to give rise to long-term changes in the neuroimmune system is not fully understood, particularly given the adolescent brain's high susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that adolescent opioid use potentiates physiological and behavioral responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness later in life. To achieve this, we treated adolescent (postnatal day 35-42) male and female C57/BL6 mice with saline or bi-daily escalating doses of morphine for 5 days to model opioid dependence and, in adulthood (postnatal day 60-67), administered saline or a low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) to promote an immune response. Body weight, body surface temperature, and locomotor activity were recorded up to 48 hours after LPS administration. Mice were also tested in the forced swim test 52 hours after LPS administration to assess depressive-like behavior. In contrast to our hypotheses, we found that adolescent morphine exposure had no additive effect on low-dose LPS-induced sickness measures when assessed in adulthood. These data suggest that adolescent opioid exposure may have minimal effects on future immune challenges, although further research is needed to confirm this.

[PMID: 41187148] Immune dysregulation is a pathogenic factor in ulcerative colitis (UC), in which mitochondrial involvement is increasingly recognized. This study aimed to construct a diagnostic model using mitochondria-related genes, identify new target genes, and illuminate the roles of mitochondria-related genes in energy metabolism, immune infiltration and the pathogenesis of UC. RNA expression data from 465 patients with UC and 154 healthy controls (HCs) were obtained from the GEO database. A total of 128 mitochondria-related differentially expressed genes (Mito-DEGs) were identified between patients with UC and HCs. A diagnostic model constructed from 20 genes showed satisfactory discrimination, calibration functions, clinical benefits and clinical impacts. Enrichment and immune infiltration analyses revealed significant differences in mitochondrial structure and function, immune cell disorders, and signaling pathway activation between the high- and low-mitochondrial gene expression UC groups. Correlations between mitochondrial structure and function and immune cells were evaluated. Single-cell RNA sequencing data were used to analyze the hub gene distribution, cell‒cell communication, and enrichment. Cell‒cell communication analysis revealed that immune response and pathogenesis pathways are activated in UC. Experiments revealed that the expression of the ACADM and ACADSB genes was decreased in UC patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of UC by altering energy metabolism, promoting immune disorders and activating pathogenic signaling pathways. The mitochondria-related genes are valuable for the diagnosis of UC. ACADM and ACADSB may play important roles in UC pathogenesis.

[PMID: 41187146] The analysis of molecular interactions between antigens and antibodies is crucial for understanding the immunological mechanisms underlying the immune response and for developing effective therapies against various diseases. In this context, the ability to distinguish between protein interfaces that form stable and unstable complexes is a key step in the design of therapeutic antibodies and vaccines. In recent years, deep learning models have provided advanced tools for biomedical research. This work introduces a novel approach to analyzing antibody-antigen interactions, and in particular SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-targeting antibodies, using a Siamese Neural Network specifically designed to integrate depth maps with geometric descriptors of molecular surfaces. By combining these representations, the model captures geometrical shape complementarity to differentiate between stable and unstable protein complexes. The network was trained using image-based representations of antigens and antibodies interfaces enriched with geometric descriptors, using data that include binders and non-binders of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain. The deep learning network operates by comparing feature vectors representing these molecular surfaces; pairs with closer vectors in feature space are associated with stable interactions, while those with more distant vectors suggest instability. Extensive testing with different configurations achieved an accuracy of 90%, demonstrating the robustness of this approach to predict interactions. This innovative integration of artificial intelligence, depth maps and geometric descriptors offers promising applications for designing novel antibodies and vaccines.

[PMID: 41187143] Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a global public health crisis. Evaluating intervention impact requires accurate estimates of how the AMR burden will change over time, given likely demographic shifts. This study aimed to provide an estimate of future AMR burden in Europe, investigating resistance variation by age and sex and the impact of interventions to achieve the proposed United Nations (UN) political declaration targets. Using data from 12,807,473 bloodstream infection (BSI) susceptibility tests from routine surveillance in Europe, we estimate age- and sex-specific rates of change in BSI incidence for the 8 bacteria included in European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) surveillance over 2015-2019. This was used to project incidence rates by age and sex for 2022-2050 and, with demographic projections, to generate estimates of BSI burden (2022-2050). Two Bayesian hierarchical models were fitted across 38 bacteria-antibiotic combinations to the 2015-2019 resistance proportion of BSI by year and at the country-level with and without age and sex disaggregation. Inputting the incidence estimates into the ""agesex"" and ""base"" model, respectively, we sampled 1,000 model estimates of resistant BSI burden by age, sex, and country to determine the importance of age and sex disaggregation. We explored Intervention scenarios consisting of a 1, 5, or 20 per 100,000 per year reduction in infection incidence rate of change or 5 per 100,000 per year reduction in those older than 64 years. Overall, in Europe, BSI incidence rates are predicted to increase more in men than women across 6 of the 8 bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium were the exception) and are projected to increase more dramatically in older age groups (74+ years) but stabilise or decline in younger age groups. We project huge country-level variation in resistance burden to 2050, with opposing trends in different countries for the same bacteria-antibiotic combinations (e.g., aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter spp. ranged from a relative difference of 0.34 to 15.38 by 2030). Not accounting for age and sex results in differing resistance burden projections, with 47% of bacteria-antibiotic combinations estimated to have fewer resistant BSIs by 2030 compared to a model with age and sex. Not including age or sex resistance patterns results in fewer male cases for 76% (29/38) of the combinations compared to 11% (4/38) for women. We also saw age-based associations in projections with bigger differences at older ages. Achieving a 10% reduction in resistant BSI incidence by 2030 (equivalent to the UN 10% mortality target) was possible only for 68.4% (26/38) of bacteria-antibiotic combinations even with large reductions in BSI incidence rate of change of -20 per 100,000 per year. In some cases, a 10% reduction was followed by a rebound, with the resistant BSI burden exceeding previous levels by 2050. Limitations include reliance on European data and current trends, and the exclusion of factors such as comorbidities or ethnicity. Including country-specific, age- and sex-specific resistance levels alongside projected demographic shifts has a large impact on resistant BSI burden projections in Europe to 2030. Reducing this AMR infection burden by 10% will require substantial reductions in infection incidence rates.",10

Here, we perform integrative proteomic analysis on 272 early stage HBV-HCC tumors from four East Asian cohorts, uncovering two robust molecular subtypes. Group B (<i>n</i> = 53) is associated with hyperproliferation, oncogenic signaling, and significantly poorer overall (<i>P</i> <0.001) and relapse-free survival (<i>P</i> <0.05). In contrast, group A (<i>n</i> = 219) is enriched in differentiation and metabolic pathways. These findings are validated by matched transcriptomics (<i>n</i> = 108), aligning with established classifications. We identify subtype-specific protein signatures, with CD46, HNF1A, and ATP1B1 exclusively expressed in the aggressive group B. Finally, computational drug sensitivity prediction, validated by molecular docking, nominates Sunitinib as a potential therapy for group B patients. Our work provides a proteomic framework for improved prognostication and targeted therapy in high-risk HBV-HCC.

[PMID: 41187205] Dopamine is known to play a role in the development of myopia. In this study, we investigated the effect of dopamine (DA) on the secretion of transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Additionally, we examined the effects of SCH23390 (D1 receptor antagonist) and sulpiride (D2 receptor antagonist) on TGF-β2 levels in ARPE-19 cells to elucidate the underlying mechanism of DA in myopia development. Human RPE cells were cultured with or without different concentrations of DA, SCH23390, or sulpiride. Cell proliferation was examined using the CCK-8 assay. Cell migration was assessed by performing a cell scratch (wound healing) assay. The expression of TGF-β2 was evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Furthermore, the secretion of TGF-β2 into the ARPE-19 cell supernatant was quantified using ELISA. Treatment with 20 μg/mL of DA significantly increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA and protein expression levels of DRD1, DRD2, YAP, and TEAD and decreased TGF-β2 levels compared with that in control group. However, treatment with 24 μg/mL of SCH23390 for 24 h significantly decreased (P < 0.05) DRD1 and TGF-β2 mRNA expression and increased DRD2, YAP, and TEAD mRNA expression in ARPE-19 cells compared with that in the control group. Additionally, the protein expression levels of TGF-β2, YAP, TEAD, and SMAD7 were consistent with the mRNA levels. Notably, treatment with sulpiride (14 μg/mL) increased (P < 0.05) DRD1 and TGF-β2 expression and decreased DRD2, YAP, and TEAD expression in the cells at both the mRNA and protein levels compared with that in the control group. Our findings suggest that dopamine suppresses TGF-β2 secretion in human retinal pigment epithelial cells primarily through activation of D2 receptors, which appears to involve the YAP-TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway. This regulatory mechanism may contribute to the control of scleral remodeling and thus influence the development of myopia.

[PMID: 41187121] Environmental, social and governance performance is an important driver for companies to achieve innovative and high-quality development, and the relationship between sustainable development and corporate innovation is one of the key concerns of pharmaceutical companies. This study aims to reveal the intrinsic role mechanism of sustainable transformation of pharmaceutical enterprises in high-quality innovation development. Based on the relevant data of China's A-share pharmaceutical listed companies from 2015 to 2022, the study establishes a fixed effect model and a mediation effect model, empirically examines the impact of ESG performance on the innovation of pharmaceutical listed companies, and deeply explores the role mechanism of R&D personnel investment and government subsidies in it. The study finds that: (1) ESG performance significantly enhances firms' innovation inputs and green innovation outputs; (2) this facilitating effect is more substantial among non-state-owned firms and firms in the eastern region; (3) good ESG performance has a more pronounced facilitating effect on innovation inputs of large firms, while it has a more prominent effect on the green innovation outputs of small and medium-sized firms; and (4) the mechanism analysis indicates that internal R&D personnel investment and external government subsidies play a significant mediating effect between ESG performance and corporate innovation. This study provides new empirical evidence for understanding the mechanism of ESG performance on corporate innovation in Chinese pharmaceutical companies. It provides theoretical support for proactively promoting the sustainable transformation and deepening the development of green innovation in Chinese pharmaceutical companies. In addition, there are important policy implications for promoting the sustainable transformation of pharmaceutical companies: the establishment of differentiated ESG incentive policies, the improvement of R&D talent training mechanisms, and the optimization of government subsidy allocations, focusing on supporting green innovation by companies with excellent ESG performance.

[PMID: 41187080] Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP) plays a critical role in host defense against invading pathogens, including <i><i>Listeria</i> monocytogenes (<i>Listeria. monocytogenes</i>)</i>, <i><i>Salmonella typhimurium (<i>S. typhimurium</i>)</i></i>, and <i>Francisella novicida (<i>F. novicida</i>)</i>. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms controlling LAP remain poorly understood. Here, we identify enkurin domain-containing protein 1 (ENKD1) as a key negative regulator of LAP during infection with these pathogens. Macrophages infected with <i><i>L.</i> monocytogenes</i> (10403S), <i>S. typhimurium</i> (ATCC14028), or <i>F. novicida</i> (U112) exhibit significant ENKD1 downregulation. ENKD1-deficient macrophages display enhanced antibacterial activity, characterized by increased LAP, higher reactive oxygen species production, enhanced LC3 lipidation on phagosomes, and improved phagosome-lysosome fusion. In vivo, ENKD1<i>-</i>deficient mice <i>ex</i>hibited improved bacterial clearance in the liver and spleen, with notable survival benefits. Mechanistically, ENKD1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), which mediates degradation of Run domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein (RUBCN) through K48-linked polyubiquitination, thereby dampening RUBCN's role in LAP. Our findings reveal an ENKD1-TRIM21-RUBCN axis that suppresses LAP, providing insights into antibacterial immune regulation and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to enhance host defense against intracellular pathogens.

[PMID: 41187059] The intestinal mucus layer produced by goblet cells is a critical component of innate immunity. The key host factors and regulatory mechanisms controlling goblet cell function in mucus layer formation remain poorly understood. This study identifies a function for the microprotein FXYD domain-containing transport regulator 3 (FXYD3) in goblet cells in regulating mucus layer formation to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Deficiency of FXYD3 in mouse intestinal epithelial cells results in a damaged mucus barrier, leading to dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to colitis. Mechanistically, FXYD3 interacts with endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase SERCA2 to enhance its pump activity. FXYD3 deficiency causes defects in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and mucin glycosylation, impairing mucus layer integrity. Furthermore, metabolites of gut microbiota, propionate, and butyrate promote FXYD3 expression. In ulcerative colitis patients, FXYD3 expression is significantly downregulated and correlates with disease severity. These findings indicate FXYD3 is a key mediator of host-microbiota interactions for intestinal health.

[PMID: 41186968] Rice cooking and eating quality (CEQ), a core agronomic trait tied to consumer preference and market value, is regulated by endosperm starch, protein, and lipid metabolism; this review synthesizes advances in its molecular mechanisms, focusing on genetic determinants and regulatory networks of storage substances. Starch is key: the Wx gene (central hub) has ≥ 9 allelic variants (e.g., Wxᵃ, Wxᵇ and Wx<sup>ela</sup>), modulating amylose content (AC) via GBSSI activity, Wx gene expression levels, splicing efficiency, etc., and exerting pleiotropic effects on protein/lipid metabolism, grain transparency, and taste; storage proteins (80% glutelin) harm CEQ by inhibiting starch gelatinisation, regulated by relevant gene families and vesicular pathways (e.g., Rab5a-VPS9a); lipids (0.3%-3% of endosperm) affect Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) profiles and aroma via genes like OsFAD, PDCT, FGC3; modules (e.g., OsNF-Ys, OsbZIP60, Ghd7-OsNAC42) balance starch-protein accumulation. Breeding strategies include marker-assisted selection, CRISPR/Cas9 editing of Wx elements or glutelin genes, gene pyramiding (Wx, ALK, GS3), and artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated intelligent breeding to boost efficiency; the review first proposes a framework: 'Wx genotype determination - amylopectin/glutelin regulation - CEQ improvement', and the establishment of this framework is rooted in the core role of the Wx gene in determining rice eating quality, which is achieved through its pleiotropic regulation of starch, protein, and lipid metabolism in the endosperm. Future directions: use Wx allelic diversity, decipher multi-omics modules (e.g., RNA methylation in starch metabolism), and integrate aroma, Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), grain shape, chalkiness, sugar transport genes to balance yield and CEQ for rice breeding.

[PMID: 41186893] Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, with its pathogenesis involving complex biological processes such as DNA damage, epigenetic modification and oncogene mutation. Over the past two decades, the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the occurrence, metastasis and progression of HCC has received increasing attention. As an important noncoding RNA molecule, lncRNAs play a key role in regulating gene expression, affecting RNA transcription and mRNA stability. This review elucidates the potential pathogenic processes of HCC and elaborates on the synthesis mechanisms of the above three non-coding RNAs. It comprehensively summarizes various non-coding RNAs that have been identified as playing key regulatory roles in HCC, as well as how these non-coding RNAs affect disease progression by regulating gene expression and protein functions. For example: lncRNAs such as NEAT1, DSCR8, PNUTS, HULC, and HOTAIR can play different roles in the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HCC cells in different ways. lncRNAs such as HClnc1, LINC01343, FAM111A-DT, CERS6-AS1, and TLNC1 significantly affect the progression of HCC by regulating key signaling axes or protein functions, and are closely related to the prognosis of patients. In addition, we also discuss the potential of lncRNAs as therapeutic targets for HCC, such as: lncRNA MIR31HG, CASC2c, and lncRNA AC115619. Furthermore, we also explore the application prospects of lncRNAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new perspectives and directions for future HCC research.

[PMID: 41186887] This research examines how NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) and its functional variant rs2273534 influence gastric cancer (GC) risk, development, and prognosis, along with the molecular pathways involved. 840 GC patients and 840 healthy controls participated in a case-control research. Genetic association analyses, molecular experiments (qRT-PCR, Western blot, functional assays), and bioinformatics approaches were employed. Cell-based and animal experiments were employed to validate the oncogenic role of NKILA and its regulatory axis. Carriers of the NKILA rs2273534 C allele exhibited a markedly higher susceptibility to GC (OR = 1.51, p = 0.003) and an unfavorable prognosis (HR = 1.89, p = 0.016), which was also associated with elevated NKILA expression. Elevated NKILA expression in GC tissues was associated with advanced clinicopathological characteristics. Mechanistically, NKILA promotes the expression of 5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 2 (OAS2) through sponging miR-4424, which in turn facilitates proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in GC cells. Rescue experiments confirmed that the NKILA/miR-4424/OAS2 axis is crucial for GC malignancy. The rs2273534 SNP enhances NKILA expression and drives GC progression through the NKILA/miR-4424/OAS2 axis. Our findings highlight rs2273534 as a possible indicator for GC susceptibility and prognosis, offering insights into the oncogenic mechanisms mediated by lncRNAs.

[PMID: 41186780] The widespread use of pesticides such as deltamethrin (a pyrethroid) and acetamiprid (a neonicotinoid) has sparked concerns regarding their effects on human health, particularly their potential role in carcinogenesis. This study investigated the cytotoxic, molecular, and functional effects of these pesticides, individually and in combination, on the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line. This model was chosen to specifically investigate estrogen recpetor (ER)-independent mechanisms due to its expression of targets such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER); however, it does not reflect normal mammary cell responses. Cytotoxicity was assessed via XTT assays, migration was analyzed using wound-healing assays, and gene expression changes in AhR, PPARγ, and Caspase-3 were measured using RT-qPCR. Molecular docking was performed to predict pesticide-protein interactions, and in silico toxicity assessments using ProTox-II supplemented the in vitro results by predicting toxicity profiles relevant to public health. Both pesticides exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity, and their combination produced an additive effect on cell viability. Importantly, suppression of cell migration and downregulation of AhR and PPARγ expression reflected toxic stress responses at high pesticide concentrations, rather than therapeutic or anti-cancer potential. While apoptosis-related gene expression (Caspase-3) was increased, this effect did not reach statistical significance. Molecular docking supported strong interactions with key pathways related to xenobiotic metabolism and apoptosis. These findings emphasize that, at high and non-environmentally relevant concentrations, deltamethrin and acetamiprid induce additive cytotoxic effects and disrupt molecular processes in a mechanistic cancer model. The results highlight the need for further investigation using normal cell systems and environmentally relevant exposures to clarify real-world risk and biological mechanisms, and should not be interpreted as evidence of therapeutic activity. This study underscores the mechanistic relevance of pesticide exposure in environmental toxicology rather than any potential therapeutic application.

[PMID: 41186651] Progesterone, traditionally recognized for maintaining the gestational environment, also plays a pivotal immunomodulatory role essential for successful pregnancy in bovine species. This review synthesizes current understanding of progesterone-mediated immune regulation during early bovine pregnancy, focusing on its molecular mechanisms. These include genomic pathways involving nuclear progesterone receptors, non-genomic signaling through membrane progesterone receptors and progesterone receptor membrane component 1, and immunoregulatory effects mediated by the progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF). Progesterone acts both locally at the maternal-fetal interface and systemically, shaping immune tolerance and protecting the developing conceptus. Locally, it promotes an anti-inflammatory microenvironment by expanding regulatory T cells, reducing the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, and suppressing dendritic cell activation. It downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, while upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-4 and interleukin-10. Additionally, progesterone inhibits the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway, thereby attenuating inflammatory responses. PIBF contributes by enhancing T helper 2 cytokine profiles and reducing cytotoxic activity. Emerging evidence also suggests that progesterone modulates immune function in peripheral organs, including the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, indicating systemic immunoregulation. However, species-specific differences in receptor expression, signaling cascades, and immune cell responsiveness remain poorly understood. Addressing these gaps is essential for optimizing reproductive management in cattle. In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of progesterone's immunological roles may lead to improved fertility outcomes and advance knowledge of maternal-fetal immune tolerance in ruminants.",10

While caspase-mediated pathways are central to pyroptosis, the involvement of apoptotic regulators such as Bak, Bax, and MCL-1 in bacterial infection-induced pyroptosis remains unclear. Here, we investigated how these BCL-2 family proteins modulate pyroptosis induced by Vibrio vulnificus and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in murine cells. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), both pathogens strongly induced Gbp2 expression and activated caspase‑11, whereas activation of caspase‑1 occurred only in macrophages, indicating engagement of both non-canonical and canonical pyroptosis pathways. Importantly, Bak-/- and Bax-/- MEFs exhibited significantly reduced Gbp2 upregulation and caspase-11 activation-an effect most pronounced in Bak-deficient cells leading to attenuated pyroptotic cell death. These data suggest that pro-apoptotic proteins, Bak and Bax, act as positive regulators that amplify the Gbp2-caspase-11 axis. Conversely, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL‑1 had no significant impact on Gbp2 expression, caspase activation, membrane integrity, or LDH release, indicating that pyroptosis proceeds independently of MCL‑1 regulation. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel role for Bak and Bax in promoting Gbp2-driven pyroptosis during Gram-negative bacterial infections, while MCL‑1 does not impede this process. This work expands our understanding of the crosstalk between apoptotic and pyroptotic pathways in innate immune responses.

[PMID: 40827894] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a severe pulmonary condition characterized by widespread alveolar injury and inflammatory cascade activation. While alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells are recognized as critical mediators in ARDS pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms underlying their dysfunction remain incompletely understood. This study investigated the regulatory role of the P2rx7-Panx1 signaling axis in orchestrating alveolar macrophage pyroptosis and subsequent exosome-mediated ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS. The study utilized both an in vivo ARDS mouse model and in vitro systems comprising MH-S alveolar macrophages and MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells. P2rx7-Panx1 interaction was characterized through Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation studies. The functional consequences of P2rx7 and Panx1 depletion were assessed through comprehensive analyses of cell viability, inflammatory cytokine profiles, oxidative stress parameters, and protein expression patterns. LPS exposure induced significant upregulation and enhanced interaction of P2rx7 and Panx1 in alveolar macrophages both in vivo and in vitro. Selective knockdown of either P2rx7 or Panx1 significantly attenuated LPS-induced macrophage pyroptosis, as evidenced by reduced cell death, diminished NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 activation, and decreased IL-1β/IL-18 secretion, with dual knockdown exhibiting synergistic protection. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated macrophages induced ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells through P2rx7-dependent exosome release, while P2rx7 blockade effectively prevented this exosome-mediated epithelial cell ferroptosis. This study elucidates a novel mechanism whereby the P2rx7-Panx1 axis synergistically regulates LPS-induced alveolar macrophage pyroptosis through caspase-11-dependent pathways. Moreover, P2rx7 functions as a critical modulator of exosome release from alveolar macrophages, thereby promoting ferroptotic death of alveolar epithelial cells. These findings identify the P2rx7-Panx1 signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target in ARDS treatment.

[PMID: 40072283] Pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death mediated by the gasdermin family, has emerged as a promising strategy for inducing anti-tumor immunity. However, efficiently inducing pyroptosis in tumor cells remains a significant challenge due to the limited activation of key mediators like caspases in tumor tissues. Herein, a self-priming pyroptosis-inducing agent (MnNZ@OMV) is developed by integrating outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) with manganese dioxide nanozymes (MnNZ) to trigger pyroptosis in tumor cells. OMVs, derived from Escherichia coli, are coated onto spiny MnNZ to prepare MnNZ@OMV. Once internalized by tumor cells, MnNZ@OMV responds to elevated intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels, releasing Mn<sup>2</sup>⁺ and OMV components. This leads to GSH depletion and Mn<sup>2</sup>⁺-catalyzed reactive oxygen species generation, which triggers NF-κB translocation and prime caspase-11 expression. Subsequently, lipopolysaccharides from OMVs activate caspase-11, resulting in GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis induction. MnNZ@OMV significantly induces tumor pyroptosis in vivo, promoting dendritic cell maturation and CD8⁺ T cell activation, leading to robust anti-tumor effects. Collectively, this study presents a novel self-priming approach for inducing tumor cell pyroptosis through the noncanonical caspase-11/GSDMD pathway, offering a promising avenue for future cancer immunotherapy.

[PMID: 40028711] Endothelial pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory programmed cell death, promotes endothelial inflammation and is a pivotal process in the initial stage of acute lung injury (ALI). Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a gasotransmitter primarily dependent on cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, plays a protective role during ALI. Nonetheless, the modulatory role and precise molecular mechanism of endothelial endogenous CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S in the pathogenesis of ALI remain elusive. Herein, we prepared an ALI mouse model using intratracheal administration of LPS (5 mg/kg), and lung injury was assessed by evaluating pulmonary edema, inflammatory response, and endothelial pyroptosis. In this model, H<sub>2</sub>S production from pulmonary tissues declined in a time-dependent manner, accompanied by a compensatory elevation of CSE protein levels. Treatment with the H<sub>2</sub>S donor (NaHS) attenuated pulmonary edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, endothelial pyroptosis, and reduced serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Meanwhile, the inducible deletion of CSE in endothelial cells exacerbated these changes. The blocking effect of CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S on endothelial pyroptosis (evidenced by caspase-11 activation and GSDMD-NT formation) was also confirmed in cultured pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs). Mechanistically, H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated regulation of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) expression and activation (via sulfhydration) contributed to the modulatory process. Collectively, we uncovered that endothelial endogenous CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S alleviates endothelial pyroptosis by activating SIRT1, thereby preventing LPS-induced acute lung injury.

[PMID: 39992609] ZAKα-driven ribotoxic stress response (RSR) has been shown to trigger diverse biological effects. Nevertheless, its role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) remained unclear. This study aimed to determine the role of ZAKα in the development of UC. Our study found that ZAKα expression was significantly increased in colonic epithelium of UC patients and DSS-colitis mouse models. Moreover, the expression level of ZAKα mRNA showed a positive correlation with disease activity. In the colitis model, Vemurafenib, the ZAKα inhibitor, treatment reduced colonic inflammation and ameliorated intestinal mucosal barrier damage, while Anisomycin, the RSR agonist, showed the opposite effect. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Anisomycin induced pyroptosis instead of apoptosis in C26 cell line. Western blot analysis revealed that Anisomycin triggered pyroptosis via the Caspase-11/GSDMD pathway. Further animal studies confirmed that Vemurafenib downregulated this pathway, reducing colonic epithelial cell pyroptosis. Finally, blocking Caspase-11 reduced severity of DSS-induced colitis in Anisomycin-treated mice. In all, ZAKα seems to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of colitis, as it promotes pyroptosis in colonic epithelial cells and exacerbates colitis in part by upregulating the Caspase-11/GSDMD axis.

[PMID: 39823227] Macrophages express pattern recognition and cytokine receptors that mediate proinflammatory signal transduction pathways to combat microbial infection. To retaliate against such responses, pathogenic microorganisms have evolved multiple strategies to impede innate immune signaling. Recent studies demonstrated that YopJ suppression of TAK1 signaling during Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection promotes the assembly of a RIPK1-dependent death-inducing complex that enables caspase-8 to directly cleave and activate gasdermin D (GSDMD). However, whether and how macrophages respond to Yersinia infection in the absence of YopJ or caspase-8 activity remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that loss of YopJ or its catalytic activity triggers non-canonical inflammasome activation in macrophages and that caspase-11 is required to restrict the bacterial burden in vivo. Under conditions of low caspase-8 activity, wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis invades macrophages and accesses the cytosol, leading to non-canonical inflammasome activation. Thus, our study highlights the plasticity of death pathways to ensure GSDMD activation during Yersinia infection.

[PMID: 39744431] Intimal hyperplasia (IH) remains a significant clinical problem, causing vascular intervention failure. This study aimed to elucidate whether gangliosides GA2 accumulated in atherosclerotic mouse aortae and plasma promote the development of IH. We identified that GA2 was remarkably accumulated in both artery and plasma of atherosclerotic patients and mice. Injected GA2 exacerbated IH and mainly co-stained with macrophages after mouse carotid arterial injury model. Intracellular GA2 induced pyroptosis accompanying the IL-1α release, which was blocked by caspase-11 knockout. Mechanistically, GA2 directly activated caspase-4 as a new ligand. And then, activated caspase-4/11 combined and cleaved BID, promoting the cytochrome C release to cytoplasm, which derived gasdermin E-medicated pyroptosis through activation of caspase-9-caspase-3 pathway. Mice transplanted with caspase-11 deficient bone marrow or mice with caspase-11 knockdown in macrophages exhibited an improvement of the IH aggravated by GA2. These findings suggest GA2-mediated caspase-4/11 activation drives macrophage pyroptosis, contributing to IH. Our results provide a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in IH.

[PMID: 39664579] Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated caspases-4 (humans) and caspase-11 (rodent) (caspase-4/11) signaling can cause maturation of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and cellular pyroptosis in the macrophages through guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs). However, how caspase-4/11s bind with GBPs together to activate caspase-4/11 by LPS remains elusive. We here found that BA derivatives from gut microbiota can regulate sensitivity of macrophages to LPS and Gram-negative bacteria through <i>lncRNA57RIK</i>. BA derivatives such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) could induce <i>lncRNA57RIK</i> expression through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) in the macrophages of mice and humans. Both murine and human <i>lncRNA57RIK</i> knockout (KO) macrophages did not produce immune response(s) to LPS or gram negative bacteria. <i>LncRNA57RIK</i> KO mice had also reduced inflammatory responses to LPS or <i>Salmonella</i> typhimurium (<i>S.</i> T) infection. Mechanistically, <i>lncRNA57RIK</i> could bind intracellular proteases caspase-4/11 with GBP1 together in the macrophages of human and mice to cause LPS-mediated activation of caspase-4/11. Thus, BA derivatives from gut microbiota promote GBPs-mediated activation of caspase-4/11 by LPS through <i>lncRNA57RIK</i>.

[PMID: 39614435] Infection is the leading cause of acute lung injury (ALI). Macrophages, which are pivotal innate immune cells, play a critical role in mediating inflammatory processes. Intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from invasive Gram-negative bacteria can activate the caspase-11 inflammasome, leading to the induction of pyroptosis in macrophages. This process subsequently triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns from pyroptotic macrophages, thereby exacerbating inflammatory progression in ALI. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms governing caspase-11 activation is still unclear. Sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) have been identified as notable targets for their anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, the specific role of SENPs in macrophage pyroptosis during the pathogenesis of ALI remains unknown. We used LPS as an endotoxin to induce ALI. We analyzed the expression and location of sentrin-specific protease 1 (SENP1), pulmonary impairment, macrophage infiltration, caspase-11 inflammasome expression and activation, caspase-11 SUMOylation, and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Upregulated expression of SENP1 in lung tissue and macrophages was observed following LPS stimulation. SENP1 mediates de-SUMOylation and activation of caspase-11 inflammasome in macrophages. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition or genetic deficiency of SENP1 in macrophages significantly improved ALI-related histological damage by reducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and suppressing caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis. Collectively, our findings highlight the involvement of SENP1 in caspase-11 activation and inflammatory progression in macrophages, thereby establishing a scientific foundation for the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating ALI.

[PMID: 38526704] Hypothermia is an essential environmental factor in gastrointestinal diseases, but the main molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis remain unclear. The current study sought to better understand how chronic cold stress affects gut damage and its underlying mechanisms. In this work, to establish chronic cold stress (CS)-induced intestinal injury model, mice were subjected to continuous cold exposure (4 °C) for 3 h per day for 3 weeks. Our results indicated that CS led to gut injury via inducing changes of heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70) and apoptosis-related (caspases-3, Bax and Bcl-2) proteins; enhancing expression of intestinal tight-related (ZO-1 and occludin) proteins; promoting releases of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), interleukin1β (IL-1β), IL-18 and IL-6 inflammatory mediators in the ileum; and altering gut microbial diversity. Furthermore, persistent cold exposure resulted in the cleavage of pyroptosis-related Gasdermin D (GSDMD) protein by regulating the NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 and caspase-11 pathway, and activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, which are strongly associated with changes in gut microbiota diversity. Taken together, these investigations provide new insights into the increased risk of intestinal disorders at extremely low temperatures and establish a theoretical foundation for the advancement of novel pharmaceutical interventions targeting cold-related ailments.",10

The effects of such extended aggregation of doses form an important part of the everyday concerns of radiological protection against low-level exposures. For more than half a century, databases of nuclear workers have been assembled, and the numbers of workers currently included in studies, together with the numbers of deaths among them that have now occurred, are capable of generating reasonably precise risk estimates that should provide meaningful comparisons with those obtained from other studies, such as of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, constructing, updating and maintaining these large databases, linking workers to occupational dose databases and to registers of deaths (and other outcomes, such as incident cancers) and their causes, and analyses of these data that endeavour to take account of other influential factors (such as smoking) are far from straightforward. A critical review of recent nuclear worker studies illustrates the difficulties in reliably interpreting reported statistical associations between rates of cancer and cumulative occupational doses because of the real possibility of distortions produced by biases, confounding and/or the interplay of radiation with other risk factors. This doesn't mean that studies of nuclear workers should be abandoned, far from it, but it does mean that appropriate effort needs to be expended on these studies before confident conclusions about the levels of risks from radiation exposure can be drawn from them. Unexpected findings should be examined in depth to gain a proper understanding of their origin, including the impact of doses from intakes of radionuclides upon dose-responses derived using doses from external sources of radiation.

[PMID: 41187303] The reconstruction of perovskite oxides into transition metal oxyhydroxides (MOOH) has reshaped traditional structure-activity paradigms in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. Understanding the structural origins of catalytic activity in reconstruction-derived MOOH is important for rationally optimizing its catalytic activity. Herein, by achieving complete reconstruction of SrCoO<sub>3-δ</sub>, we show that A-site Sr actively participates in the formation of γ-CoOOH through intercalation. To explore the way and extent to which the A-site species can modulate the structure and catalytic performance, Ba is further introduced into the γ-CoOOH interlayer with varying Ba/Sr ratios. The disparity in atomic radius between Ba and Sr induces a local compressive strain in γ-CoOOH, resulting in distortion of the CoO<sub>6</sub> octahedron. This structural distortion could lift the degeneracy of <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub>* orbitals, populating more electronic states around the Fermi level and hence significantly enhancing the electron transfer ability and corresponding OER activity. Consequently, the reconstructed Ba<sub>0.3</sub>Sr<sub>0.7</sub>CoO<sub>3-δ</sub>-h with the strongest <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub>* band broadening exhibits superior OER activity, achieving 4.06 A cm<sup>-2</sup> at 2.0 V in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer device and operating stably at 1 A cm<sup>-2</sup> for more than 200 h. This work highlights the pivotal role of A-site cations in manipulating the reconstruction of perovskite precatalysts and offers a design principle for developing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.

[PMID: 41187227] Diamondoids are a class of rigid, cage-like hydrocarbons found exclusively in petroleum on Earth, renowned for their exceptional thermal and thermodynamic stability. Their resistance to decomposition under geological conditions makes them valuable as geological markers. However, a limited understanding of the processes leading to their formation has hindered their broader application, particularly in comparison to conventional biomarkers. This study explores the formation pathways of the simplest diamondoid, adamantane, via a carbocationic mechanism originating from isomeric hydrocarbons. The thermodynamic stability of adamantane and the 1-adamantyl cation was assessed relative to their isomers using the M06-2X/cc-pVTZ level of theory. The results confirm that adamantane is the most stable C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub> isomer; however, its corresponding carbocation, 1-adamantyl, is not the most stable C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub><sup>+</sup> species. Instead, the most stable carbocations are allylic species containing the 1-methylhexahydroindene ring system, which is associated with the naphthenic fraction of petroleum. These findings suggest that hydrocarbons containing the 1-methylhexahydroindene ring system may have a geochemically relevant connection to diamondoid formation, and their ratios can be of geochemical interest.

[PMID: 41187183] The objective of this study was to characterize the occurrence of urosepsis in oncology patients and to explore the potential factors influencing its development and outcomes. Urosepsis is a serious systemic infection originating from a urinary tract infection. Its management is particularly challenging in immunocompromised oncology patients. A retrospective review of 337 oncology patients diagnosed with urosepsis between 2019 and 2023 was conducted. Various clinical and demographic factors were examined, including patient gender, type of tumor (solid or liquid), nephrostomy, presence of a double J (DJ) stent, diabetes mellitus, length of hospital stay, and use of central lines. Statistical analysis was performed to assess associations between these variables and urosepsis. Males were found to be at higher risk to develop urosepsis (p: 0.039). Escherichia coli was the most commonly identified pathogen. However, none of the analyzed factors, including tumor type (p: 0.432), nephrostomy (p: 0.503), DJ stent (p: 0.325), diabetes mellitus (p: 0.637), length of hospital stay (p: 0.185), or presence of a central line (p: 0.122), showed a statistically significant association with the occurrence of urosepsis. This study is the first to examine urosepsis in oncology patients in Palestine. The findings highlight the increased risk for developing urosepsis in male gender; however, the other factors studied were not significant. The results cannot be generalized to all hospitalized patients as the studied population was in a tertiary hospital, and a bigger sample size is recommended for future studies to allow generalizability of the results.

[PMID: 41187091] SUMOylation - a protein post-translational modification (PTM) related to ubiquitylation - involves the reversible covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to proteins. During the conjugation and deconjugation cycle, SUMO is recognised and positioned by various enzymes through specific non-covalent interactions. This review discusses the core interactions with the SAE2 subunit of the SUMOspecific heterodimeric E1 enzyme SAE1:SAE2, the SUMO E2 enzyme UBC9 and the SUMO-specific proteases of the SENP family and USPL1. We describe the evolutionary origins of these interactions and their structural basis; moreover, as SUMO:enzyme interactions are generally similar in their overall outline to those between ubiquitin and its specific enzymes, we highlight these similarities, as well as the differences. All of the mentioned interactions use a similar surface on SUMO, which is distinct from the groove that binds SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), meaning that while the enzyme interactions are mutually exclusive, each is compatible with simultaneous SIM binding. This review is accompanied by another in the same issue that focuses on interactions with SUMO E3 ligases and downstream effectors of SUMOylation, together providing comprehensive coverage of the non-covalent interactions formed by SUMO proteins.

[PMID: 41187088] Lithium metal is widely recognized as the ultimate anode material for next-generation lithium batteries due to its superior specific capacity. However, microscopic crystallographic heterogeneity caused by crystal faces and grain boundaries leads to nonuniform lithium deposition, thereby undermining the stability of lithium metal anode. This study systematically investigates the intricate impact of grain boundaries on the structural characteristics, deposition behavior, and electrochemical properties of lithium metal. We demonstrate that grain boundaries serve as preferential nucleation sites, exacerbating morphological heterogeneity. Although eliminating preexisting grain boundaries from substrate facilitates homogeneous lithium nucleation and enhances electrochemical performance, this approach does not address the deposition issues originating from the intercrystalline regions of newly deposited grains. Furthermore, the continuous expansion of the intercrystalline network disrupts single-crystal structure and accelerates anode degradation, imposing a critical constraint on performance enhancement. This work unveils a previously overlooked intercrystalline-driven failure mechanism and provides insights for realizing dendrite-free lithium batteries.

[PMID: 41187054] The etiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of many uterine diseases including endometritis, cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), and pyometra remain poorly understood in canids, hindering the advancement of effective preventative therapeutics to ultimately improve fertility. The development of an in vitro endometrial cell culture system that mimics in vivo architecture, cellular morphology, and physiological responses would facilitate a greater understanding of the mechanisms of complex canine uterine diseases and reduce the need for in vivo research. Three-dimensional organoid cell cultures may provide an innovative approach for studying uterine pathologies in the bitch. Unlike traditional two-dimensional monolayer cell culture systems, organoids can be grown long-term whilst maintaining the structure, phenotype, and function of their organ of origin. Here we report the generation and characterization of canine endometrial organoids via immunohistochemistry (IHC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and RT-qPCR and demonstrate their responsiveness to exogenous steroid hormones mimicking the estrous cycle. Furthermore, gene expression of key inflammatory markers was upregulated in endometrial organoids derived from bitches with CEH compared to organoids derived from healthy tissue. Findings highlight canine endometrial organoids as a valuable model to study both normal uterine physiology and disease-related processes in dogs. Organoids are cells that are grown three-dimensionally in the laboratory that retain similar functions to the organ from which the cells were collected. Organoids were used here to study the female dog reproductive tissue without the need for live animals, which saves time and money and improves animal welfare. We developed a three-dimensional model of the dog uterus that responds to reproductive hormones and maintains its normal structure. In addition, we used diseased canine tissue to replicate cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), a condition that affects pregnancy and can lead to the serious disease of pyometra in which the uterus is infected and filled with pus. In future studies, this validated model can be used to study how CEH develops and to test new treatments for the disease.

[PMID: 41186750] The vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts play a crucial role in controlling lumbar erector spinae (LES). Electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) can be used to investigate the contribution of the vestibular system in the control of a muscle during a motor task. A recent study observed a minimal contribution of the corticospinal projection to LES in a voluntary spine extension. We thus hypothesised a greater involvement of alternative pathways originating in the brainstem such as vestibulo- and reticulospinal tracts in the control of LES for this task. This study investigates the impact of EVS on the activation of LES during postural and voluntary tasks. Fifteen participants performed two motor tasks: a bilateral shoulder flexion (postural task) and a lumbar spine extension (voluntary task) during a simple precued reaction time (RT) paradigm. During the RT tasks, EVS was applied at three different timings (early, middle and late) within a pre-defined time window. Outcomes were (1) LES onset latencies elicited by the motor tasks and conditioned by EVS and (2) the central processing duration (CPD). EVS significantly reduced the onset latency of LES activation in both postural and voluntary tasks. The CPD was shorter for the postural compared to the voluntary task for the early and middle conditions. EVS shortens LES onset, suggesting a contribution of brainstem networks/tracts in both tasks. The shorter CPD for the postural task at early and middle timings compared to the voluntary task suggests an earlier contribution of the brainstem networks/tracts during the postural task. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and validate this paradigm.im.

[PMID: 41186745] The Mongolian Gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) diverged from rats/mice around 45 million years ago and developed adaptations to extreme temperatures and water scarcity. Another feature of the Mongolian Gerbils is their social monogamy similar to that of prairie voles. These observations suggest that there are potential differences in the Mongolian Gerbil brain that are distinct from that of rats and mice. The goal of the present study is to establish the extent to which the neuromeric organization of the brain is conserved in the Mongolian Gerbil and to gain insights on how evolutionary expansion and diversification of brain regions occur across species. Our data shows that the multineuromeric origin of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive processes in the Mongolian Gerbil is similar to that in mice and rats, spanning from the diencephalon, midbrain, and the rostral hindbrain. There are also observable anatomical differences. However, most of the components characteristic of these neuromeres are identifiable in the Mongolian gerbil, closely mirroring those found in mice and rats. Together, these findings suggest that the conserved neuromeric organization likely stems from a restricted genetic toolset that began in the Muridae family 45 million years ago, and that a profound reorganization of the fundamental structural plan delineating the neuromeric segmentation is not required for the emergence of diverse functionality among species of phylogenetically related families. Future studies are needed to establish how the genetic programs within each neuromeric unit are influenced by environmental factors that ultimately impact the size of the neuromeric derivatives and their functional connectivity.

[PMID: 41186680] Water is arguably the most important liquid on Earth. Consequently, its anomalous properties have been intensely investigated for over 50 years. However, water's thermal conductivity maximum (TCM) remains hitherto unexplained. Beyond its substantial fundamental interest, this problem is critical because many natural (e.g., climate regulation), industrial and chemical processes in which water appears as solvent at near-standard conditions correspond to the anomalous heat transport regime of water. We use all-atom and minimal coarse-grained models to isolate the TCM's thermodynamic fingerprint, and subsequently demonstrate its thermodynamic and microscopic origin: (1) the depopulation of librational modes due to nuclear quantum effects and (2) the balance of two interconverting molecular arrangements, the high density and low density liquid states, that coexist in water. We systematically investigate tetrahedral liquids modeled with Stillinger-Weber potentials, which allows the interpolation between simple liquids and low coordination materials such as carbon. We show that the TCM is not exclusive to water, but an anomalous behavior shared by pure liquids with intermediate tetrahedrality. Our work provides a thermodynamic explanation for the TCM of water and tetrahedral liquids in general.",10

In this study, we identified integrin α3β1, composed of ITGA3 and ITGB1 subunits, as a sialylated glycoprotein ligand for Siglec-10, an inhibitory glyco-immune checkpoint receptor highly expressed on TAMs in PDAC. The interaction between Siglec-10 on TAMs and α3β1 on PDAC cells suppressed macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, thereby promoting immune evasion. Consistently, disrupting Siglec-10 interactions using mAbs significantly enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of PDAC cells and alleviated myeloid cell-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation and activation in vitro. In both a xenograft mouse model engrafted with human macrophages and a human Siglec-10 transgenic mouse model, targeting Siglec-10 with mAbs reduced PDAC growth. These findings suggest that Siglec-10 interactions are key mediators of TAM-driven immune evasion in PDAC and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting these interactions to restore antitumor immunity. Pancreatic tumor cells exploit integrin α3β1 to engage the immunosuppressive checkpoint receptor Siglec-10 on myeloid cells, driving immune evasion, which can be targeted with antibody-mediated blockade of Siglec-10 to restore antitumor immunity.

[PMID: 41168836] Type I interferon (IFN) has long been known as a critical component of the molecular machinery that first responds to viral infection in multicellular eukaryotes. More recently, type I IFN signaling has also emerged as a common process in the microenvironment of naturally developing neoplasms, as well as tumors responding to (immuno)therapy. In this setting, robust, acute but ultimately resolving type I IFN responses appear to support natural and therapy-driven cancer immunosurveillance by a number of mechanisms, including an accrued propensity of malignant cells to arrest their proliferation and undergo apoptotic cell death, as well as broad immunostimulatory effects on CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Conversely, weak, indolent and ultimately non-resolving type I IFN responses de facto facilitate tumor progression, not only by promoting stemness in malignant cells (which is associated with increased metastatic dissemination and resistance to therapy), but also by favoring the establishment of a highly immunosuppressive lymphoid and myeloid tumor microenvironment. Here, we provide a critical discussion of the context-dependent impact of type I IFN signaling on cancer progression and response to treatment, focusing on the tumor-intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may account for such a heterogeneity.

[PMID: 41151871] Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer. Although current evidence is based on studies with limited sample sizes, recent findings suggest that anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies are highly effective in patients with locally advanced dMMR/MSI-H rectal cancer. We report the case of a 70-year-old man with locally advanced MSI-H rectal cancer who exhibited a remarkable and durable response to pembrolizumab. Histopathological examination revealed the infiltration of CD8-positive T lymphocytes and clusters of PD-L1-expressing macrophages within the tumor tissue. CD103-positive tissue-resident memory T-cells have also been identified in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a robust and sustained local immune response. Immune checkpoint blockade may represent a promising nonsurgical treatment option for patients with locally advanced dMMR/MSI-H rectal cancer.

[PMID: 41146586] The immune response to implanted medical devices can impact their performance and longevity in the body. Instead of designing implants to produce the desired immune responses, this might more easily be achieved with the use of surface modification technology, which can alter the biological profile of the implant without compromising function or performance. In the present study, we generated two polyelectrolyte (PE) multilayer (PEM) coatings from polystyrenesulfonate (PSS) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). These two coatings had identical chemical compositions, but the wettability and surface charge were adjusted by altering the deposition conditions. Testing the immune response to these coatings <i>in vitro</i> showed that the differing surface properties of the two coatings impacted morphology (circularity) and actin-cytoskeleton formation (podosomal structures) of THP-1-derived macrophages. We furthermore observed a substantial pro-inflammatory response toward the coating with the medium hydrophilic properties and moderate surface charge density (PEM_MH), while the highly hydrophilic and strongly negatively charged coating (PEM_HH) resulted in a much milder inflammatory response. Application of the latter coating to implant materials that elicited pronounced inflammatory responses resulted in a substantial reduction in the inflammatory response observed. This was validated by using blood-derived primary human immune cells. The dampened pro-inflammatory effect could be observed with two different materials: polymer membranes and titanium. Our results highlight the promise of pure PEM coatings without any additional substances as a tool to tune the immune response toward established medical implants.

[PMID: 41053962] Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is an effective intervention for end-stage arthritis; however, its long-term success is often compromised by wear particle-induced osteolysis, leading to aseptic loosening and implant failure. This study investigates the potential of kaempferol (Ka), a natural flavonoid with anti-inflammatory properties, to alleviate osteolysis by modulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In a murine calvarial osteolysis model, Ka administration significantly attenuated bone loss induced by CoCrMo alloy particles. Mechanistically, Ka dose-dependently inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages, as evidenced by reduced IL-1β secretion, decreased ASC oligomerisation and suppressed GSDMD cleavage, ultimately leading to decreased pyroptosis. These effects were found to be partially mediated via GPR109a. Furthermore, Ka markedly suppressed osteoclast differentiation and activity both in vivo and in vitro while promoting osteoblast differentiation, thereby contributing to the restoration of bone remodelling balance. Taken together, our findings suggest that Ka exerts a protective effect against wear particle-induced osteolysis by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome and modulating osteoimmune responses, which may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to manage periprosthetic osteolysis and prolong implant longevity.

[PMID: 41048033] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively rare but debilitating diagnosis in the pediatric population, and patients with end-stage HCM require heart transplantation. Here, we have examined the transcriptome in ventricular tissue from this patient group to identify cell states and underlying cellular processes unique to pediatric HCM. We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on explanted hearts at transplant in 3 pediatric patients with end-stage HCM and compared findings to pediatric control and adult HCM. We identified distinct underlying cellular processes in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and myeloid cells compared with controls. Pediatric HCM was enriched in cardiomyocytes exhibiting stressed myocardium gene signatures and underlying pathways associated with cardiac hypertrophy; cardiac fibroblasts exhibited activation signatures and compared with adult patients, exhibited heightened downstream processes associated with fibrosis and a unique, myofibroblast-like cluster with increased metabolic stress and antiapoptotic properties. We noted depletion of tissue-resident macrophages and increased vascular remodeling in endothelial cells in pediatric HCM. Our analysis provides the first single-nucleus analysis focused on end-stage pediatric HCM. Fibroblast-mediated cellular processes were the most prominent in pediatric HCM, which had more downstream processes associated with fibrosis than did adult HCM.

[PMID: 41010555] Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a form of large vessel vasculitis that primarily affects older adults and forms granulomatous inflammation in the aorta and its major branches. Recent advances in immunology and multi-omics technologies have elucidated several key mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of GCA, including immune checkpoint dysregulation, clonal hematopoiesis, and age-associated immune dysfunction. From the perspective of immune cell subsets, a diverse range of immune cells-including tissue-resident memory T cells, stem-like T cells, macrophage subsets, B cells, and myofibroblasts-play distinct roles in sustaining vascular inflammation and tissue remodeling. This review summarizes the latest immunopathological and omics-based insights into GCA, proposes potential therapeutic targets, and discusses future directions for precision medicine aimed at achieving sustained remission.

[PMID: 40981767] The foreign body response (FBR) is an inevitable host response to implanted materials, initiated by tissue injury and marked by a cascade of inflammatory and fibrotic processes. Following implantation, local tissue damage triggers acute inflammation, characterized by immune cell recruitment and activation. Over time, this response advances to a chronic fibrotic phase marked by dense extracellular matrix deposition and fibrous capsule formation, which can encapsulate and, in some cases, functionally isolate the implant. Both the early inflammatory and late fibrotic stages of FBR can severely impair the performance and longevity of implants. FBR is governed by a dynamic and multifaceted network of molecular signaling pathways, cellular mechanosensing mechanisms, and intercellular communication. Despite its clinical significance, the molecular underpinnings of FBR remain incompletely defined. A deeper molecular understanding is critical for the rational design of next-generation biomaterials that mitigate adverse host responses and improve biocompatibility. In this review, we provide the first comprehensive overview of the current knowledge of the molecular events driving FBR, with the goal of informing strategies for therapeutic modulation and biomaterial innovation.

[PMID: 40944627] High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been employed in clinical practice for tumor treatment via thermal ablation. However, the high energy requirements of HIFU raise safety concerns, and insufficient therapeutic efficacy can lead to potential tumor recurrence. To address these issues, we developed multifunctional theranostic nanoparticles (PFP@POMP@MnO<sub>2</sub>-Ce6 NPs) and utilized dual-frequency HIFU technology to enhance therapeutic efficiency at lower energy levels. This approach achieved efficient and rapid thermal/cavitation/sonodynamic synergistic therapy, leveraging long-term therapy through immune responses and precise monitoring via US/MRI dual-modal imaging. The NPs are composed of polymer micelles that encapsulate perfluoropentane (PFP), with their surface modified by MnO<sub>2</sub> and sonosensitizer Chlorin e6 (Ce6). The results indicated that dual-frequency HIFU irradiation triggered the vaporization of PFP within the NPs, enhancing both the thermal and cavitation effects of HIFU, which led to an increase in the area of thermal damage in the phantoms. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the NPs, when combined with dual-frequency HIFU, could achieve synergistic antitumor effects, inducing 94.1 ± 1.5% (<i>p</i> < 0.01) tumor cell death in vitro and ablation of directly treated tumors without recurrence in vivo. Most interestingly, the synergistic therapy suppressed the growth of distal tumors (93.4 ± 1.1% growth inhibition), indicating enhanced immune responses, which was further supported by immunohistochemical (IHC) results of a 69.3 ± 1.5% increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and a 61.2 ± 1.5% increase in F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration. It ensured the longevity of the treatment effects and reduced the likelihood of tumor recurrence. Moreover, the NPs' dual-modal imaging (US/MRI) capabilities provided real-time guidance and improved tumor visualization, confirming their utility as potent theranostic agents. This therapeutic approach, facilitated by multifunctional nanoparticles and in synergy with dual-frequency HIFU, provided precise imaging guidance, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and elicited an immune response, thereby effectively addressing the limitations inherent to traditional HIFU therapy.

[PMID: 40926018] Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is hampered by issues of nonresponse and resistance, highlighting the urgent need for alternative or complementary treatments. Our study revealed significant upregulation of taurine in the intestinal tissues of IBD patients, which was inversely related to the severity of the disease. A key discovery was that TNF directly induced taurine synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells and increased the production of angiogenin, a nuclease that degrades mitochondrial RNA, which is known to amplify inflammatory responses. By degrading mitochondrial RNA, angiogenin inhibits the inflammatory response in macrophages, suggesting a potent immune-modulatory role for taurine. This mechanism implies that taurine could serve as an adjunct to anti-TNF therapies, enhancing their efficacy and providing a novel strategy for the management of IBD and other chronic inflammatory diseases by harnessing the body's innate immune regulatory mechanisms.",10
Aggravated inflammation is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation.,NLRP3 inflammasome AND Inflammation AND Aggravated AND Activation,"41139368,41008252,40977728,40815040,40806570,40778489,40751834,40751797,40749533,40748587","[PMID: 41139368] Selenium (Se) is an essential metalloid, possessing not only antioxidant but also anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies have shown that the latter may be mediated by modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, although the exact mechanisms have yet to be fully characterized. Therefore, the objective of this review is to discuss the molecular mechanisms by which Se modulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and to examine the downstream effects on NLRP3-mediated inflammation and pyroptotic cell death. The selenoproteins S, O, M, W, and especially glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD) are involved in regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome machinery through modulation of redox homeostasis. In contrast, Se deficiency has been shown to aggravate NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment or exposure to organic pollutant bisphenol A (BPA). In addition to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, Se deficiency contributes to NLRP3-mediated inflammation and pyroptosis through modulation of non-coding RNA expression. In turn, Se supplementation mitigates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in liver, heart, kidneys, intestine, brain, and certain other tissues induced by LPS exposure, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), and various xenobiotics including heavy metals and organic pollutants. This effect appears to be mediated by modulation of various components of Toll-like receptor (TLR)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/NRLP3, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ROS/NLRP3, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 pathways, and several other mechanisms including modulation of gut microbiota with subsequent reduction of circulating LPS levels. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of Se supplementation may be mediated by modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

[PMID: 41008252] Secondary liver injury (SLI) is the most common complication in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and it is susceptible to environmental factors, including diet patterns. As a food-brightening agent, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs) are inevitably consumed by IBD patients. Currently, there are a few studies on TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs exposure to SLI in colitis mice. In this study, a SLI model was built using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) free-drinking for 7 days after pre-exposure to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. The changes in the pathological results and liver function indicators suggested that high-dose TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs only exhibited a slight injury in the liver. With further analysis, we found that pre-exposure to high-dose TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs in mice with SLI led to an increase in intestinal permeability and hepatic LPS content, along with increased inflammatory cytokines and an anti-oxidative system imbalance. Subsequently, accumulated LPS and ROS overproduction activated the NOD-like receptor family pyrin-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, inducing hepatic cell pyroptosis. To provide compelling evidence, NLRP3 gene-deficient mice were used, and the results showed that the absence of NLRP3 improved liver function, alleviated hepatic inflammation, and reduced hepatic oxidative injury in SLI mice with TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs exposure. In summary, these results confirmed the critical role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the TiO<sub>2</sub> NP-aggravated progression of SLI. Our study provided a comprehensive evaluation of foodborne nanoparticles on IBD complications, hoping that more studies can focus on IBD complications affected by environmental factors.

[PMID: 40977728] Chronic endometritis (CE) is a persistent inflammatory disorder of the endometrium, associated with infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and implantation failure. Diagnosis primarily depends on hysteroscopy and immunohistochemistry, while microbial dysbiosis and antibiotic resistance pose significant challenges to effective management. The pathogenesis of CE involves microbial infections that induce immune dysregulation through TLR/NLR signaling pathways, metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, miRNA-mediated inflammatory responses, and DNA methylation alterations. The activation of pro-inflammatory mediators and the NLRP3 inflammasome further aggravates endometrial dysfunction. Treatment typically includes oral antibiotics and intrauterine therapies, although their efficacy is variable. Probiotics have demonstrated potential in restoring microbial balance. This review outlines the inflammatory mechanisms underlying CE and recent therapeutic advancements, highlighting potential targets for improving treatment outcomes.

[PMID: 40815040] Endometriosis (EMS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with ectopic endometrial tissues arising in extrauterine areas. We investigated the mechanism of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/P2X4 regulating inflammation and oxidative stress in EMS. Normal endometrial tissues and ectopic endometrial tissues were collected, and determined for P2X4 expression by immunohistochemical staining. Normal (nESCs) and ectopic endometrial stromal cells (eESCs) were isolated and manipulated with Apyrase (a soluble ATP-diphosphohydrolase), 5-BDBD (a P2X4 receptor antagonist), or Nigericin (a NOD-like receptor 3 [NLRP3] inflammasome activator). The ATP concentration in endometrial tissues and cells were assessed through the ATP colorimetric/fluorescence assay, and cellular P2X4 expression was determined by RT-qPCR. Fluo 3-AM calcium ion fluorescence probe was utilized for detecting calcium ion concentration. Levels of inflammation-associated proteins (interleukin [IL]-1β, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], IL-6, IL-18), oxidative stress indicators (malondialdehyde [MDA], superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], and glutathione peroxidase [GSH-Px]), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway-related proteins were determined by ELISA, DCFH-DA fluorescent probe, and Western blot. ATP and P2X4 were upregulated in EMS. Apyrase or 5-BDBD treatment or P2X4 knockdown reduced the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, MDA, and ROS, but increased the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT in eESCs. Besides, 5-BDBD treatment decreased the expression levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway-related proteins in eESCs and suppressed the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. Nigericin could reverse the inhibitory impact of 5-BDBD on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Altogether, ATP/P2X4 aggravates inflammation and oxidative stress in EMS by activating NLRP3.

[PMID: 40806570] Gut microbiota-derived trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been implicated in both intestinal and renal diseases; however, its specific role in modulating gut-kidney interactions remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of TMAO on gut-kidney crosstalk using a mouse model of diarrhea. Mice were divided into four groups: normal, model, TMAO, and TMAO + model. The normal group received sterile water, while the other groups were administered adenine + <i>Folium sennae</i>, TMAO, or a combination of TMAO and adenine + <i>Folium sennae</i>. Samples were collected to assess morphological changes in the colon and kidney, evaluate the colonic mucosal barrier and renal function, and measure NLRP3 inflammasome activity and inflammatory cytokine levels in colonic and renal tissues. TMAO levels and the gut microbiota composition were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. The model group exhibited altered stool morphology, which was further aggravated by TMAO intervention. Both the model and TMAO + model groups exhibited significant damage to intestinal and renal tissues, along with compromised intestinal mucosal barriers and impaired renal function compared to controls. Inflammatory markers were elevated in these groups, with the TMAO + model group showing the most pronounced increases. Correlation analysis indicated significant relationships among TMAO levels, inflammasome activation, and inflammatory cytokines. The genera <i>Mucispirillum</i> and <i>Anaerotruncus</i> negatively correlated with TMAO, whereas <i>Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Parasutterella</i> genera positively correlated with TMAO. In conclusion, TMAO plays a critical role in modulating gut-kidney crosstalk by promoting inflammation, disrupting mucosal and renal integrity, and altering the gut microbial ecosystem.

[PMID: 40778489] Hyperglycemia has been reported to be a crucial factor that aggravates liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Macrophage-mediated inflammatory injury is vital to liver IRI. A positive effect of Liver X receptor (LXR) on diabetes has been proven; however, the function and mechanism of LXR in diabetic liver IRI remain unclear. Accordingly, our study concentrates on the mechanism underly. Streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg)-treated diabetic mice were used to establish a liver IRI model. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were used in studying the role of macrophage inflammation in diabetic liver. GW3965 hydrochloride was used to activate LXR in vivo and in vitro. QD394, a lipid peroxidation agonist, was used to verify the underlying mechanism. Hyperglycemia exacerbates liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) by promoting hepatic cell death and inflammation in vivo. In diabetic livers, the expression of liver X receptors (LXRs) is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the ischemia-reperfusion process itself further decreases LXR levels. Application of the LXR agonist GW3965 mitigates macrophage lipid peroxidation and inflammasome NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3) inflammasome activation in vitro, thereby protecting the liver from severe IRI. The results were further confirmed by the rescue experiments. LXRs play an important role in diabetic liver IRI and macrophage-associated inflammation. Pharmacologic activation of LXRs alleviates macrophage inflammatory activation in diabetic liver IRI, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes-related liver injury.

[PMID: 40751834] Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a significant complication of diabetes mellitus driven by pathological mechanisms that include inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and metabolic dysregulation. Emerging evidence highlights the role of lactate metabolism and associated post-translational modification, lactylation, as important contributors to the progression of DN. Lactate exacerbates inflammation through enhancing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Lactate also drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition, ultimately leading to renal fibrosis. Furthermore, lactate promotes apoptosis through multiple pathways in DN. Lactylation, a novel epigenetic modification that links lactate to cellular signaling, impairs endothelial function, antioxidant responses and DNA repair, and promotes fibrotic process, further aggravating DN. This review systematically elucidates the role of lactate and lactylation as important regulatory factors from the aspects of lactate metabolism and protein lactylation modification in DN. In conclusion, lactate and lactylation have important clinical significance as well as possible therapeutic potential for DN.

[PMID: 40751797] Neuronal cell death is considered the symbol of early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but the mechanism was still unclear. DDX3X, a member of the DEAD-box helicase family, has a major effect on immune inflammation by mediating RNA metabolism. Recent studies report that DDX3X regulates the balance of NLRP3 inflammasome and stress granules in stress conditions, but the role of DDX3X in SAH is still unknown. Therefore, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the role and mechanism of DDX3X in SAH. Western blot and immunofluorescence showed that SAH promoted DDX3X expression, especially in the cortical neurons. After upregulation of DDX3X, the NLRP3 inflammasome was activated and autophagy was inhibited, resulting in neurological dysfunction and damage to the blood-brain barrier. Further rescue experiments confirmed that DDX3X aggravated neuronal pyroptosis and inhibited autophagy via the NLRP3 inflammasome after SAH. Hence, DDX3X might be a potential therapeutic target for early brain injury of SAH.

[PMID: 40749533] Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBD) represents a primary cause of neurological impairment in neonates and is frequently associated with persistent cognitive and motor deficits. This study explores the regulatory function of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) in modulating NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation in a neonatal rat model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), and evaluates the impact of the OPA1 inhibitor MYLS22 on neuroinflammatory responses and cerebral injury. Neonatal rats were subjected to HIBD. Temporal expression patterns of OPA1 and inflammasome-associated proteins were assessed using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and histopathological analyses. The influence of MYLS22 treatment on neuroinflammatory markers, brain pathology, and cognitive outcomes was also investigated. HIBD led to a marked reduction in long-form OPA1 (L-OPA1) expression and a concomitant increase in short-form OPA1 (S-OPA1). Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome peaked between 24 and 48 h post-injury. Treatment with MYLS22 suppressed OPA1 expression in a dose-dependent manner, further enhancing inflammasome activation and aggravating brain injury, characterized by enlarged infarct volumes, increased edema, and impaired cognitive performance. Conversely, in vitro overexpression of L-OPA1 attenuated inflammasome activation and reduced microglial inflammation following ischemia/reperfusion insult, indicating a neuroprotective effect. These findings demonstrate a pivotal role for OPA1 in controlling neuroinflammation and mitochondrial integrity in the context of HIE. Modulation of OPA1 expression or targeting inflammasome signaling may represent promising therapeutic strategies to alleviate neuroinflammatory injury and improve neurological outcomes in neonates.

[PMID: 40748587] This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the interplay between cholesterol crystals (CCs), NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the progression of atherosclerosis. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of CCs in enhancing plaque inflammation and instability, increasing the risk of rupture or erosion. Early studies focused on the mechanism of lysosomal damage induced by CCs, leading to the release of cathepsin B into the cytoplasm, which in turn triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation. More recent studies suggest that the trafficking of cholesterol within macrophages activates NLRP3 via CaMKII/JNK signaling, and NLRP3 deubiquitylation. The activation of the complement system by CCs can also contribute to NLRP3 inflammasome activation via changes in mitochondrial energy metabolism and ROS production worsening atherosclerosis. CCs can aggravate atherosclerosis by triggering a complex interplay of pathways, including lysosomal damage, cholesterol trafficking to ER, and complement system activation, all of which converge on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, driving plaque inflammation and instability.",10
Amitriptyline is an effective treatment for chronic tension-type headaches.,Amitriptyline AND Chronic AND Tension-Type Headaches AND Efficacy,"38646979,30890994,29104684,28548676,26859719,25931277,25829028,25499091,25129572,23943730","[PMID: 38646979] In this retrospective cross-sectional real-world evidence study from the Danish Headache Center (DHC), a national tertiary headache center in Denmark, we sought to identify potential pharmacological agents for the treatment of new daily persistent headache (NDPH). NDPH is an enigmatic headache disorder with abrupt onset and chronic duration for which evidence-based treatments are lacking. NDPH is a diagnosis of exclusion, for which secondary headaches must be ruled out and the etiology remains idiopathic. The sparse investigations of this disorder have not yielded a pathophysiological basis and no effective treatment for NDPH has been found. All patients with an NDPH diagnosis at the DHC were enrolled (n = 64). First, we reviewed the records of all patients with an NDPH diagnosis to evaluate whether they fulfilled the diagnostic criteria. Next, we extracted all the trialled acute and prophylactic pharmacological interventions for the included patients. Then, pharmacological interventions that had been tried in ≥ 20 patients were analyzed post hoc with efficacy as the outcome, which was stratified in five effect categories (""no effect,"" ""partial effect,"" ""full effect,"" ""partial effect and cessation due to adverse events,"" and ""full effect and cessation due to adverse events""). Descriptive statistical analysis was performed, and the results were schematically presented (see Table 2). Fifty-one patients out of 64 were found to fulfill NDPH criteria and were included in the study. The drugs tried by ≥ 20 patients were amitriptyline (n = 34), candesartan (n = 27), and mirtazapine (n = 20). No patients experienced a complete effect with these drugs while 9% (3/34), 26% (7/27), and 15% (3/20) experienced a partial effect with no adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation, respectively. The remaining patients experienced either no effect or a partial effect with adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. In this study we add real-world evidence to suggest that prophylactic drugs conventionally used for treating chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache have limited utility for treating NDPH; however, a partial response in 26% of patients using candesartan and 15% of patients using mirtazapine warrants further investigation in randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials.

[PMID: 30890994] <b>Introduction:</b> Chronic headaches are not a rare condition in children and adolescents with negative effects on their quality of life. Our aims were to investigate the clinical features of chronic headache and usefulness of the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD 3) criteria for the diagnosis in a cohort of pediatric patients. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients attending the Headache Center of Bambino Gesù Children and Insubria University Hospital during the 2010-2016 time interval. Statistical analysis was conducted to study possible correlations between: (a) chronic primary headache (CPH) and demographic data (age and sex), (b) CPH and headache qualitative features, (c) CPH and risk of medication overuse headache (MOH), and (d) CPH and response to prophylactic therapies. Moreover, we compared the diagnosis obtained by ICHD 3 vs. ICHD 2 criteria <b>Results:</b> We included 377 patients with CPH (66.4% females, 33.6% males, under 18 years of age). CPH was less frequent under 6 years of age (0.8%; <i>p</i> < 0.05) and there was no correlation between age/sex and different CPH types. The risk to develop MOH was higher after 15 years of age (<i>p</i> < 0.05). When we compared the diagnosis obtained by ICHD 2 and ICHD 3 criteria we found a significant difference for the undefined diagnosis (2.6% vs. 7.9%; <i>p</i> < 0.05), while the diagnosis of probable chronic migraine was only possible by using the ICHD2 criteria (11.9% of patients; <i>p</i> < 0.05). The main criterion which was not satisfied for a definitive diagnosis was the duration of the attacks less than 2 h (70% of patients younger than 6 years; <i>p</i> < 0.005). Amitriptyline and topiramate were the most effective drugs (<i>p</i> < 0.05), although no significant difference was found between them (<i>p</i> > 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> The ICHD 3 criteria show limitations when applied to children under 6 years of age. The risk of developing MOH increases with age. Although our ""real word"" study shows that amitriptyline and topiramate are the most effective drugs regardless of the CPH type, the lack of placebo-controlled data and the limited follow-up results did not allow us to conclude about the drug efficacy.

[PMID: 29104684] Some of the excitatory neurotransmitters including glutamate have been suggested to be involved in headache pathophysiology. To our knowledge, there is a lack of publication about flunarizine efficacy in chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) treatments and the roles of glutamate in CTTH pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the flunarizine effect on serum levels of glutamate and its correlation with headache intensity based on the Numeric Rating Scale for pain (NRS) scores in CTTH patients. In a prospective randomised, double-blind study with pre and post-test design, seventy-three CTTH patients were randomly allocated with flunarizine 5 mg, flunarizine 10 mg and amitriptyline 12.5 mg groups. The serum levels of glutamate and NRS scores were measured before and after 15-day treatment. Flunarizine 5 mg was more effective than flunarizine 10 mg and amitriptyline 12.5 mg in reducing serum glutamate levels, whereas amitriptyline 12.5 mg was the most effective in reducing headache intensity. There was found nonsignificant, but very weak negative correlation between headache intensity and serum glutamate levels after flunarizine 5 mg administration (r = -0.062; P = 0.385), nonsignificant very weak negative correlation after flunarizine 10 mg administration (r = -0.007; P = 0.488) and there was found a significant moderate positive correlation (r = 0.508; P = 0.007) between headache intensity and serum glutamate levels after amitriptyline 12.5 mg administration. Since there was no significant correlation found between serum glutamate and headache intensity after treatment with flunarizine, it is suggested that decreasing of headache intensity after flunarizine treatment occurred not through glutamate pathways in CTTH patients.

[PMID: 28548676] Chronic migraine is common, affecting approximately 1% of the general population, and causes significant disability. To summarize optimal involvement of primary care physicians in chronic migraine care, and to provide algorithms to assist them in the diagnosis and management of patients with chronic migraine. An analysis of diagnostic and treatment needs in chronic migraine, based on a synthesis of the medical literature and clinical experience. Chronic migraine represents the more severe end of the migraine spectrum, usually arises out of previous episodic migraine, and is characterized by headache on 15 days a month or more. Importantly, the headache needs to meet migraine diagnostic criteria on only 8 days a month in order to meet chronic migraine diagnostic criteria. When acute medication overuse is present, a second diagnosis of medication overuse headache should be made. If patients meet criteria for chronic migraine, this excludes a diagnosis of chronic tension-type headache. Acute therapy of chronic migraine is similar to episodic migraine, except that medication overuse is a much greater risk in chronic migraine and must be addressed. All patients should be considered for pharmacological prophylaxis, and the behavioral aspects of therapy should be emphasized. The two prophylactic drugs with the best evidence for efficacy in chronic migraine are topiramate and onabotulinumtoxinA. Given the disability caused by chronic migraine, these should both be available to patients as necessary. Management of chronic migraine is complex, and many patients are relatively refractory to therapy. Specialist referral will often be required and should not be unduly delayed. On the other hand, the primary care physician should be able to make the diagnosis, initiate therapy, and manage some less refractory patients without referral. The timing of referral should depend both on the expertise of the primary care physician in headache management and the patient's response to initial therapy.

[PMID: 26859719] Chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) is a disorder that evolves from episodic tension-type headache, with daily, or very frequent, episodes of headache lasting hours or they may be continuous. It affects up to 4% of the general population, and is more prevalent in women (up to 65% of cases). We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for CTTH? What are the effects of non-drug treatments for CTTH? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2013 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview). At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 125 studies. After deduplication, 77 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 56 studies and the further review of 21 full publications. Of the 21 full articles evaluated, three systematic reviews and one RCT were included at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 15 PICO combinations. In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for 12 interventions based on information about the effectiveness and safety of non-drug treatments acupuncture and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as well as the drug treatments amitriptyline, anticonvulsant drugs (sodium valproate, topiramate, or gabapentin), benzodiazepines, botulinum toxin, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (mirtazapine), NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen); opioid analgesics (e.g. codeine), paracetamol, serotonin re-uptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (other than amitriptyline).

[PMID: 25931277] This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in 2005 on selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for preventing migraine and tension-type headache. The original review has been split in two parts and this review now only regards tension-type headache prevention. Another updated review covers migraine. Tension-type headache is the second most common disorder worldwide and has high social and economic relevance. As serotonin and other neurotransmitters may have a role in pain mechanisms, SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been evaluated for the prevention of tension-type headache. To determine the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs and SNRIs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the prevention of episodic and chronic tension-type headache in adults. For the original review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2003, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1994 to May 2003), and Headache Quarterly (1990 to 2003). For this update, we revised the original search strategy to reflect the broader type of intervention (SSRIs and SNRIs). We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10) on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to November 2014), EMBASE (1980 to November 2014), and PsycINFO (1987 to November 2014). We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles and searched trial registries for ongoing trials. We included randomised controlled trials comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with any type of control intervention in participants 18 years and older, of either sex, with tension-type headache. Two authors independently extracted data (headache frequency, index, intensity, and duration; use of symptomatic/analgesic medication; quality of life; and withdrawals) and assessed the risk of bias of trials. The primary outcome is tension-type headache frequency, measured by the number of headache attacks or the number of days with headache per evaluation period. The original review included six studies on tension-type headache. We now include eight studies with a total of 412 participants with chronic forms of tension-type headache. These studies evaluated five SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine) and one SNRI (venlafaxine). The two new studies included in this update are placebo controlled trials, one evaluated sertraline and one venlafaxine. Six studies, already included in the previous version of this review, compared SSRIs to other antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, sulpiride, mianserin). Most of the included studies had methodological and/or reporting shortcomings and lacked adequate power. Follow-up ranged between two and four months.Six studies explored the effect of SSRIs or SNRIs on tension-type headache frequency, the primary endpoint. At eight weeks of follow-up, we found no difference when compared to placebo (two studies, N = 127; mean difference (MD) -0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.95 to 2.03; I(2)= 0%) or amitriptyline (two studies, N = 152; MD 0.76, 95% CI -2.05 to 3.57; I(2)= 44%).When considering secondary outcomes, SSRIs reduce the symptomatic/analgesic medication use for acute headache attacks compared to placebo (two studies, N = 118; MD -1.87, 95% CI -2.09 to -1.65; I(2)= 0%). However, amitriptyline appeared to reduce the intake of analgesic more efficiently than SSRIs (MD 4.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 8.84; I(2)= 0%). The studies supporting these findings were considered at unclear risk of bias. We found no differences compared to placebo or other antidepressants in headache duration and intensity.SSRIs or SNRI were generally more tolerable than tricyclics. However, the two groups did not differ in terms of number of participants who withdrew due to adverse events or for other reasons (four studies, N = 257; odds ratio (OR) 1.04; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.60; I(2)= 25% and OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.38; I(2)= 0%).We did not find any study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with pharmacological treatments other than antidepressants (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non-drug therapies (e.g. psycho-behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture). Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or venlafaxine (a SNRI) as preventive drugs for tension-type headache. Over two months of treatment, SSRIs or venlafaxine are no more effective than placebo or amitriptyline in reducing headache frequency in patients with chronic tension-type headache. SSRIs seem to be less effective than tricyclic antidepressants in terms of intake of analgesic medications. Tricyclic antidepressants are associated with more adverse events; however, this did not cause a greater number of withdrawals. No reliable information is available at longer follow-up. Our conclusion is that the use of SSRIs and venlafaxine for the prevention of chronic tension-type headache is not supported by evidence.

We included randomised controlled trials comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with any type of control intervention in participants 18 years and older of either sex with migraine. Two authors independently extracted data (migraine frequency, index, intensity, and duration; use of symptomatic/analgesic medication; days off work; quality of life; mood improvement; cost-effectiveness; and adverse events) and assessed the risk of bias of trials. The primary outcome of this updated review is migraine frequency. The original review included eight studies on migraine. Overall, we now include 11 studies on five SSRIs and one SNRI with a total of 585 participants. Six studies were placebo-controlled, four compared a SSRI or SNRI to amitriptyline, and one was a head-to-head comparison (escitalopram versus venlafaxine). Most studies had methodological or reporting shortcomings (or both): all studies were at unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. Follow-up rarely extended beyond three months. The lack of adequate power of most of the studies is also a major concern.Few studies explored the effect of SSRIs or SNRIs on migraine frequency, the primary endpoint. Two studies with unclear reporting compared SSRIs and SNRIs to placebo, suggesting a lack of evidence for a difference. Two studies compared SSRIs or SNRIs versus amitriptyline and found no evidence for a difference in terms of migraine frequency (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to 0.80; I(2) = 72%), or other secondary outcomes such as migraine intensity and duration.SSRIs or SNRIs were generally more tolerable than tricyclics. However, the two groups did not differ in terms of the number of participants who withdrew due to adverse advents or for other reasons (one study, odds ratio (OR) 0.39, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.50 and OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.34).We did not find studies comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with pharmacological treatments other than antidepressants (e.g. antiepileptics and anti-hypertensives). Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or venlafaxine as preventive drugs for migraine. There is no evidence to consider SSRIs or venlafaxine as more effective than placebo or amitriptyline in reducing migraine frequency, intensity, and duration over two to three months of treatment. No reliable information is available at longer-term follow-up. Our conclusion is that the use of SSRIs and SNRIs for migraine prophylaxis is not supported by evidence.

[PMID: 25499091] Post-traumatic headache is one of the most common symptoms occurring after mild traumatic brain injury in children. This is an expert opinion-based two-part review on pediatric post-traumatic headaches. In part II, we focus on the medical management of post-traumatic headaches. There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of therapies specifically for pediatric post-traumatic headaches. Thus, the algorithm we propose has been extrapolated from the primary headache literature and small noncontrolled trials of post-traumatic headache. Most post-traumatic headaches are migraine or tension type, and standard medications for these headache types are used. A multifaceted approach is needed to address all the possible causes of headache and any comorbid conditions that may delay recovery or alter treatment choices. For acute treatment, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories can be used. If the headaches have migrainous features and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are not effective, triptans may be beneficial. Opioids are not indicated. Medication overuse should be avoided. For preventive treatments, some reports indicate that amitriptyline, gabapentin, or topiramate may be beneficial. Amitriptyline is a good choice because it can be used to treat both migraine and tension-type headaches. Nerve blocks, nutraceuticals (e.g. melatonin), and behavioral therapies may also be useful, and lifestyle factors, especially adequate sleep hygiene and strategies to cope with anxiety, should be emphasized. Improved treatment of acute post-traumatic headache may reduce the likelihood of developing chronic headaches, which can be especially problematic to effectively manage and can be functionally debilitating.

[PMID: 25129572] Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often comorbid with chronic migraine (CM) and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral psychotherapies, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and venlafaxine have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of PTSD. Amitriptyline, topiramate, sodium valproate, and botulinum toxin A are efficacious for treatment of chronic daily headache (CDH). Treatment studies on individuals with CDH and comorbid PTSD, however, are limited. As such, multiple therapeutic agents or modes of interventions typically are necessary, such that comprehensive treatment simultaneously utilizes approaches with established efficacy for each individual condition.

[PMID: 23943730] Patients often present with chronic facial pain despite normal nasal endoscopy and sinus computerized tomography. Such pain has increasingly been recognized as being of neurological origin with one of the commonest underlying causes being mid-facial segmental tension-type pain (MFP) which is a version of tension headache in the face. Descending serotonergic neuronal projections are known to modulate pain and intra-platelet serotonin levels are an accepted model reflecting central intra-neuronal serotonin. 1.To determine whether low-dose amitriptyline significantly changes whole blood serotonin compared to a surrogate placebo in patients with chronic MFP 2. To determine whether the addition of pindolol, a beta blocker with serotonin receptor blocking properties further alters blood serotonin. Sixty-two patients were randomized to three treatment groups a) amitriptyline , b) amitriptyline with pindolol, and c) loratadine as surrogate placebo. Whole blood serotonin was taken before and after 8 weeks of treatment. Serotonin was also measured in 40 age-matched healthy controls. There was a significant reduction in blood serotonin levels in the amitriptyline with pindolol group. A non-significant reduction was seen in the amitriptyline group, with no change in serotonin levels in the surrogate placebo group. A comparison of change in serotonin with change in pain frequency and intensity scores is presented. Women in the control group had significantly higher serotonin levels than men. Women with tension-type facial pain who failed to respond to treatment had significantly lower blood serotonin than women in the control group. When linked to the clinical response this study provides evidence that the serotonergic system is involved in the modulation of chronic MFP. Serotonin levels are sex-dependent and related to treatment response.",10
An M2-like phenotype in brown adipose tissue macrophages is quickly induced by cold exposure.,M2-like macrophage AND brown adipose tissue AND cold exposure AND induction,"41187381,41187379,41187197,41187064,41187019,41186989,41186829,41186709,41186671,41186624","[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187197] The type I interferon (IFN-I) response, which includes IFN-I induction and signaling, plays an important role in a host's defence against viral infections. Many pathogenic viruses target it to evade the host immunity. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), the causative agent of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, which features high mortality in humans, has been reported in southeastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Although a previous study reported that CCHFV antagonizes IFN-I signaling in human cell lines, it is unclear how it inhibits IFN-I signaling. Here we demonstrated that the non-structural protein of CCHFV, NSm, suppresses IFN-I signaling in human cell lines. Furthermore, we discovered that NSm binds to STAT2, an important host protein in IFN-I signaling, and induces its degradation within cells. Taken together, our results imply that NSm suppresses IFN-I signaling by targeting human STAT2.

[PMID: 41187064] Induction of labor (IOL) is a common intervention in industrialized countries. Failed induction is frequently reported, yet there is no consensus on its definition. Since the primary goal of IOL is to initiate labor, progress to the active phase is a more relevant measure of success than the surrogate of caesarean birth. Previous studies on the influence of body mass index (BMI) on the risk of failed IOL are limited. Most rely on data from the United States and define failed IOL primarily by caesarean delivery. This study aims to explore the association between maternal BMI and failed IOL, defined as failure to progress to the active phase of labor. We studied 22 114 term, singleton women undergoing IOL in the Central Denmark Region from 2013 to 2022. Women with spontaneous prelabor rupture of membranes, uterine scar, or fetal demise were excluded. The main outcome measure was failed IOL, defined as not reaching cervical dilation of 6 cm or more. BMI, our exposure, was modeled as a continuous variable using restricted cubic splines and as a categorical variable stratified according to the World Health Organization BMI groups. Adjusted logistic regression was used in both models to assess the association between BMI and failed IOL. Proportions of nulliparous women with failed IOL ranged between 4% for normal weight and 10% for obesity class III. Adjusted odds ratios for nulliparous women for failed IOL were 1.5 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.3, 1.7) for overweight, 1.8 (95% CI 1.4, 2.3) for obesity class I, 2.7 (95% CI 2.2, 3.3) for obesity class II, and 2.9 (95% CI 1.4, 6.0) for obesity class III compared to women with normal weight. In parous women, there was a similar but less pronounced association between BMI and failed IOL with a <2% absolute risk of failed IOL. A similar pattern was found when BMI and failed IOL were modeled using restricted cubic splines. In singleton women with induced labor at term, increasing BMI was associated with higher odds of failed IOL; this association was more pronounced in nulliparous women.

[PMID: 41187019] Longan is an exotic tropical fruit crop and exhibits off-season flowering induced by potassium chlorate (KClO<sub>3</sub>), though the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We assembled a high-quality, 441.5 Mb genome of variety 'Shixia', with a contig N50 at 28.1 Mb, 29, 325 protein-coding genes, 26 telomeres and 15 centromeres. Comparative genomic analysis with lychee revealed structural variations potentially driving gene family expansions related to flavone biosynthesis and disease resistance. Transcriptomic profiling showed that natural flowering appears to be primarily regulated by photoperiod, vernalisation and autonomous pathways, while KClO<sub>3</sub>-induced flowering may preferentially activate the gibberellin pathway at 5 days after treatment (DAT) and autonomous pathways at 10 DAT, involving putative repression of DlDDF1, DlFLCs and DlSVPs, and up-regulation of DlWRKY75_2. In the perpetual-flowering variety 'Sijimi', elevated expression of photoperiod genes, such as DlCOR28, DlCOR27, DlADO3, DlPRR5, DlGI and DlJMJ30, may explain its perpetual blooming. Overexpression of DlDDF1 in Arabidopsis delayed flowering, partially reversed by KClO<sub>3</sub> through an increase in bioactive GA<sub>4</sub>. Together, KClO<sub>3</sub>-induced flowering likely involves oxidative stress response and gibberellin signalling via DlDDF1 repression, while natural flowering relies on seasonal cues. These results lay the foundation for longan genetic improvement.

[PMID: 41186829] Given the high risk of relapse for Philadelphia-negative (Ph-negative) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is often recommended following first complete remission (CR1) in high-risk patients. However, in the era of measurable residual disease (MRD) testing, allo-HCT may not be indicated for patients with standard-risk disease. Here we review the use of allo-HCT and other consolidative approaches for standard- and high-risk Ph-negative ALL, based on MRD following induction therapy. Allo-HCT is strongly indicated for patients with high-risk Ph-negative ALL, especially those who are MRD positive at end of induction. Ongoing trials using cellular and immune therapies such as blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have shown promising results in deepening response and decreasing relapse. Further, these agents have demonstrated overall manageable safety profiles. The role for allo-HCT following CR1 in patients with standard risk Ph-negative ALL is evolving with advances in therapeutic approaches. MRD is emerging as a critical prognostic factor regardless of treatment strategy, thus questioning the necessity of transplant in MRD-negative patients. With the advances in safety and accessibility of allo-HCT as well as novel therapeutics, overall outcomes in ALL continue to improve.

[PMID: 41186709] Type H vessels are sensitive markers of bone mass. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) secreted by preosteoclast was linked with type H vessel generation. Osteocytes (OCY) have been reported to modulate bone metabolism through neuronal induction and active molecules. This study aimed to characterize effect of osteocyte-derived neuropeptide Y (NPY) on ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in mice and explore the underlying mechanism. Monocytes/macrophages (Mo) were isolated and induced into preosteoclast. Small interfering RNAs were used to knockdown NPY expression in OCY. The culture medium was harvested. Preosteoclast proliferation and PDGF-BB expression were measured by CCK8 analysis and ELISA respectively. Angiogenesis-related experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of NPY and PDGF-BB on angiogenesis. Western blotting clarified PI3K/Akt pathway involvement in NPY-mediated angiogenesis. In vivo, OVX mice received cultured medium from OCY with NPY knockdown, NPY or vehicle through bone marrow cavity injection. After 2 months, bone samples were collected for µCT and immunofluorescent analysis. Serum OCN, PDGF-BB and VEGF concentrations were assessed by ELISA. It was found that osteocyte-derived NPY inhibits preosteoclast proliferation and PDGF-BB secretion. Culture medium from NPY-stimulated preosteoclasts suppressed migration and tube formation of human microvascular endothelial cells and this effect was reversed following PDGF-BB treatment. NPY negatively regulates preosteoclast PDGF-BB-induced angiogenesis through PI3K/Akt signaling. Importantly, osteocyte NPY exerted detrimental effects on type H vessel formation and aggravated bone loss in OVX mice. Our study identifies a new mechanism by which osteocyte-derived NPY accelerates OVX-induced bone mass loss via inhibiting PDGF-BB secretion and type H vessel formation.

[PMID: 41186671] Skin aging is a prominent manifestation of human aging, largely driven by oxidative stress and inflammation. D-limonene, a natural monoterpene, possesses strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help counteract these effects. This study aimed to explore the anti-aging and skin-rejuvenating potential of D-limonene in a mouse model of D-galactose-induced skin aging. 60 male mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 10). Group I served as the control. Group II received D-galactose (500 mg/kg) for 42 days to induce aging. Groups III and IV received vitamin C (100 mg/kg) either concurrently with D-galactose or after aging induction, respectively. Groups V and VI received D-limonene (100 mg/kg) either simultaneously with D-galactose or after induction. This design allowed comparison of protective versus therapeutic effects. Both concurrent and post-treatment with D-limonene substantially decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and the oxidative stress marker MDA, while enhancing antioxidant components (SOD and GPx) and promoting the synthesis of collagen types I and III. Additionally, it improved skin thickness and histomorphological scores, restoring normal skin architecture. D-limonene exerts potent anti-aging and skin-rejuvenating effects by modulating oxidation and inflammatory markers, suggesting its potential as a preventive and curative anti-aging agent.

[PMID: 41186624] Breast cancer is the leading cancer type that is reported in women worldwide, with its 2.3 million annual incidence and 685,000-related deaths (WHO, 2023). Although genetic mutations have proven to be major driving agents of tumorigenesis, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly being considered as the definitive indicator of disease progression, metastasis, immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. It is an active, diverse cellular webwork of substances cancer-related fibroblasts, (CAFs), tumor-related macrophages, (TAMs), regulatory T cells, (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cancer-related adipocytes; (CAAs). These cellular processes interact reciprocally with not only malignant cells through paracrine communication but also through the composition of the extracellular matrix, (ECM). Recent research indicates that CAFs produce pro-invasive factors i.e. TGF-B and HGF whereas TAMs tend to be M2-like and secret VEGF and IL-10 to encourage angiogenesis and immune subversion. Cytokines, chemokines, ECM proteins, and tumor-derived EVs are non-cellular factors serving to alter cellular phenotypes and facilitate construction of metastatic niche. Besides oncogenic microRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-10b) that is released in exosome, hypoxia-mediated activation of HIF-1a induces both neovascularization and metabolic reprogramming. The repolarization of TAM (e.g. CSF1R inhibitors) and depletion of CAF and inhibition of EV pathway are also being explored as therapeutic mechanisms against TME resistance and are in preclinical and clinical development. In particular, the combination procedures with immunomodulation and TME disruption have demonstrated some success in conquering resistance in TNBC models. Therefore, it is paramount to understand how the surrounding tissue, the immune system, the immune system, and other elements behave over time and space as cofounding partners of tumors, in a way that would create better precision and clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients.",10

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), characterized by high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, safety, and environmental friendliness, offer a promising solution for adsorbing these pollutants. This review systematically explores the roles, binding locations, interaction forces, and molecular mechanisms underlying LAB-contaminant interactions, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetic properties of the adsorption processes. Notably, LAB strains with outstanding adsorption capabilities are spotlighted, along with innovative enhancement strategies: optimized culture conditions, co-culture systems, nanoparticle functionalization, immobilized cells, and combinations with bio-adsorbents. The review further demonstrates the applications of LAB in ensuring safe food production and maintaining biological health. Future directions include multi-omics-driven gene discovery, genetic engineering techniques for precision regulation, and machine learning for adsorption optimization, advancing mechanistic insights and interdisciplinary solution.

[PMID: 41187320] Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are thousands of toxic synthetic chemicals that bioaccumulate and persist in the environment. They are known to cause immunotoxicity, organ damage, endocrine disruption, and reproductive impairments in wildlife such as sea otters (Enhydra lutris). However, there is limited information on the distribution of these chemicals across the northeastern Pacific, and baseline data are missing to assess their potential impacts on sea otters in regions such as British Columbia (BC), Canada. We analyzed liver (n = 11) and skeletal muscle samples (n = 5) from 11 deceased sea otters from coastal BC using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency method 1633 with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. We found 8 of the 40 tested PFAS were present in all sampled sea otters, although concentrations of each PFAS varied between individuals. Sea otter livers contained more PFAS compounds at higher total average concentrations than skeletal muscle (i.e., 8 PFAS totaling 10.38 ng/g wet wt vs. 1 PFAS totaling 0.38 ng/g wet wt). Only perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) was identified in both liver and muscle tissues, whereas the remaining 7 PFAS were unique to the liver. The three PFAS that dominated the liver PFAS composition (perfluorononanoic acid, PFOSA, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) accounted for 84% of the contaminant load in the livers. Geographically, PFAS concentrations were more than three times higher on average in sea otters recovered near major cities and shipping routes. Identifying the contaminants accumulating in sea otters provides insights into the health threats confronted by recovering sea otter populations. Our study also establishes baseline PFAS contamination levels in BC sea otters, which can be used to monitor and regulate the presence of PFAS on marine environments in western Canada.

[PMID: 41187311] Although web-based mental health resources have the potential to assist millions, particularly those who face barriers to treatment, most mental health website visitors disengage before accessing resources that can help improve their mental health. We used a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial to test whether personalized tailoring improved engagement on a self-guided mental health website. Data were collected via voluntary response sampling on the Mental Health America website. Inclusion criteria included residing in the United States and viewing a postscreening survey after completing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 postscreening survey conditions: the demographics survey or the Next Steps survey, which included additional tailoring questions assessing perceived need and participants' intended next steps. Participants who viewed the following screening results page were subsequently randomized to 1 of 5 conditions that displayed nontailored or tailored messages and featured resources, as well as persistent general resources that did not vary by condition. Data were analyzed using logistic regressions predicting disengagement and clicks on featured resources (versus persistent general resources) by condition. Adding questions to inform tailoring significantly increased the odds of disengaging by 14% (demographics survey: 25%; Next Steps survey: 27.5%; odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% CI 1.11-1.16; P<.001). Among participants who viewed a postscreening survey (n=169,647), 87,712 participants were randomized to the demographics survey condition, and 81,935 participants were randomized to the Next Steps survey condition. Among participants who submitted the demographics survey (n=38,490), tailoring resources to demographics reduced the odds of disengaging by 10% (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.87-0.94; P<.001) and, among those who engaged, increased the odds of clicking a featured resource versus a persistent general resource by 90% (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.79-2.01; P<.001). Among participants who submitted the Next Steps survey (n=34,204), tailoring messages to perceived need (P=.33), tailoring resources to intended next steps (P=.51), and a combination of both (P=.52) did not significantly reduce the odds of disengaging compared with the nontailored condition. However, tailoring resources to intended next steps and combining a tailored message to perceived need with tailored resources to intended next steps increased the odds of clicking a featured resource by 25% (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14-1.37; P<.001) and 34% (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.23-1.47; P<.001), respectively. Tailoring resources to demographics was significantly more effective in improving engagement than tailoring to perceived need or intended next steps (P≤.004). There was a small but statistically significant cost to engagement from adding tailoring questions assessing perceived need and intended next steps. Among the strategies tested in this study, tailoring resources to demographics was the most effective strategy for increasing engagement among visitors who viewed their screening results. This study demonstrates how personalization may increase engagement with mental health websites and provides design implications for future research.

[PMID: 41187267] The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Specifically, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic data sets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yields 1,865 high-confidence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular fingerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding affinity profiles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

[PMID: 41187263] Diagnostics, treatment, and research of persisting postconcussion symptoms are challenging. Assessing symptoms is essential, but currently implemented methods only allow for retrospective reporting of symptoms. A mobile health (mHealth) symptom mapping app for adults with persisting postconcussion symptoms may be an accessible and cost-efficient alternative. This study aimed to develop a research-based mobile app for symptom mapping for adults with persisting postconcussion symptoms and investigate its usability, feasibility, and safety. This was a mixed method development and usability study consisting of three iterative cycles, each including (1) app design and programming, (2) app usability evaluation by the user group, and (3) app review by the clinician group. The outcomes were the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire and Mobile App Rating Scale scores, the number of days with logged symptom data during a home-testing period, and descriptions of adverse events throughout the study period. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore the user group's experiences further. Twenty-three adults with persisting postconcussion symptoms (median age 52, IQR 34-59 years; 70% female) were included in the user group. Six clinicians (median age 53, IQR 35-60 years), including 3 (50%) females, with a mean of 13 (SD 7) years of experience working with individuals with persisting postconcussion symptoms, were included in the clinician group. The app received a mean score of 5 (SD 1.1) on the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (7-point Likert scale) from the user group and 4.1 (SD 0.4) on the Mobile App Rating Scale (5-point Likert Scale) from the clinician group. During the 28-day home-testing period, the adherence rate among the participants in the user group was 89% (IQR 78-96), and two adverse events related to increased symptom awareness were registered. Three themes were created through reflexive thematic analysis of the qualitative data: (1) Visualizing the invisible-Enabling reflection and insight; (2) Personalized yet simple-Balancing relevance and usefulness; and (3) More than just a number-The complexity behind the symptom scores. We developed a research-based symptom mapping app for people with persisting postconcussion symptoms. The app received high usability ratings from both the user and clinician groups. The app is a feasible alternative to traditional symptom mapping methods, and it is safe to use for its intended purpose.

[PMID: 41187238] Benign Familial Pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey Disease [HHD]) is a rare chronic condition, with treatments focusing on managing disease symptoms. We present a case of a 72-year-old female with refractory HHD. Despite management with standard HHD treatments, such as antibiotics and corticosteroids, the patient's flares persisted. She was started on ruxolitinib 1.5% cream, with improved symptoms. This case demonstrates the difficulties a patient with refractory HHD may experience, and the significance of exploring novel treatment options to improve disease response and patient quality of life. Ruxolitinib may be an effective treatment option for HHD management, but further investigation is necessary.

[PMID: 41187175] Access to safely managed sanitation (SMS) in sub-Saharan Africa including Zambia remains a challenge. Variations in power and interest among stakeholder significantly influence access to SMS. However, there is limited contextualization of how power and interest levels among stakeholders influenced access to SMS. The study aimed to explore and analyze how stakeholders perceived their power and interest in the context of providing SMS. The study applied the Mendelow Stakeholder Matrix to identify, characterize and analyze the actors involved in the provision of SMS in peri-urban areas in Lusaka, Zambia. A narrative qualitative research design was employed in this study. Ninety-four (94) respondents participated in the study - 25 key informants who were representatives from Government Institutions/Departments, Cooperating Partners, NGOs and community level stakeholders; 60 discussants who participated in focus group discussions, while nine (9) community leaders took part in transect walks conducted in the target areas of Kanyama, Chawama and George. Nvivo14 was utilized for data management and analysis. The main results suggested that stakeholders displayed interrelationships that were symbiotic as they depended on each other to deliver their mandates. Stakeholders categorized into Mendelow quadrants displayed varying levels of homogeneity in power and interest. In addition, some stakeholders such as the Local Authority shifted quadrants when seen to perform dual roles for example to implement and enforce the policies aimed at improved public health. The stakeholders' quadrant position coupled with persisted changes in their positions influenced their capacity to contribute effectively to the implementation of strategies to enhance access to SMS. This equally meant that implementers of SMS interventions have to regularly assess their engagement mechanisms to foster dialogue and coordination among stakeholders. Policy implications, especially to Government, may mean allocation of adequate resources to key players to enable them deliver on their respective mandates. Similarly, implications to practitioners might be the need to periodically review stakeholders and forge alliances coupled with conducting multi-sectoral meetings aimed to streamline their functions for the successful delivery of SMS.

[PMID: 41187153] Wild mushroom poisoning represents a significant public health challenge in China, with the highest mortality rate globally. Despite extensive prevention campaigns, consumption behaviors persist, particularly among university students who may be influenced by social media and peer pressure. This study applied Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to investigate psychological factors influencing wild mushroom consumption intentions among Chinese university students and identify key predictors for targeted intervention development. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 216 Chinese university students. The PMT model included threat appraisal (perceived severity, susceptibility, benefits, costs) and coping appraisal (response efficacy, self-efficacy, response costs). Behavioral intention was assessed through scenario-based consumption likelihood measures. Structural equation modeling was used to test the theoretical model. The PMT model demonstrated good fit (χ²/df = 2.14, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.073, SRMR = 0.065) and explained 42.3% of the variance in wild mushroom consumption intentions (R² = 0.423, 95% CI [0.35, 0.49]). Perceived benefits emerged as the strongest positive predictor (β = 0.385, 95% CI [0.27, 0.50], p < 0.001), while self-efficacy was the strongest negative predictor (β = -0.298, 95% CI [-0.42, -0.18], p < 0.001). Traditional threat appraisal components (severity and susceptibility) showed minimal predictive effects. Response costs also significantly predicted consumption intentions (β = 0.156, 95% CI [0.04, 0.27], p < 0.01). PMT provides a valuable framework for understanding wild mushroom consumption behavior among Chinese university students. The dominance of perceived benefits and self-efficacy as predictors suggests that effective interventions should address positive outcome expectations while building confidence in avoidance behaviors. These findings indicate that effective interventions must move beyond traditional risk communication to address the complex interplay of perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and social factors driving consumption decisions, with implications for developing culturally-tailored, multi-component prevention strategies.

[PMID: 41187132] The global rise in overweight and obesity poses significant public health challenges, contributing to premature mortality and preventable disabilities. Moreover, efforts to increase reproductive autonomy through the promotion of modern contraceptive methods are underway, with persisting concerns regarding their potential influence on weight gain. This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with overweight and obesity and to examine the mediating role of hormonal contraceptive usage among Ghanaian women of reproductive age. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using secondary data from the 2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, which involved 6,181 women aged 20 years and above. The data was cleaned and analysed with Stata Corp version 18. Associations between overweight/obesity and various sociodemographic factors were assessed, and survey-adjusted logistic regression model was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios. Survey-adjusted mediation analysis was performed via structural equation modelling to evaluate the indirect effects of hormonal contraceptives use on the relationships between the independent variables and BMI. The analysis revealed that factors such as age, highest educational attainment, marital status, religion, residential status, region, nature of employment, and wealth quintile were significantly associated with high BMI with the exception of contraceptive usage. The results of the mediation showed that, hormonal contraceptives had no significant indirect role on the relationship between high BMI and its covariates. The study revealed several determinants of high BMI, however, hormonal contraceptives neither directly nor indirectly influenced high BMI. Whereas, there is the need to integrate weight management counselling into family planning for general well-being, there is the need to intensify education to dispel misconception about the weight gain associated with the usage of hormonal contraceptives to maximize the uptake of contraceptives and improve the overall health of women in Ghana.

[PMID: 41187131] To identify predictors of extension of the injection interval beyond 8 weeks at the 24-month visit after switching to brolucizumab in aflibercept-resistant polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Retrospective observational study. 17 eyes of 16 patients with persistent or recurrent exudation on aflibercept were switched to intravitreal brolucizumab and managed with a treat-and-extend (T&E) regimen with a minimum 8-week interval after loading. The primary outcome contrasted extension (>8 weeks) versus non-extension (≤8 weeks) at month 24. Prespecified predictors were early central choroidal thickness (CCT) change from baseline to the switch visit (A0 to A1; ≥ 40% reduction) and pachychoroid. Associations were tested with Fisher's exact tests and Firth-penalized logistic regression with the event defined as extension. At 24 months, 6 of 17 eyes (35%) achieved extension. A ≥ 40% early CCT reduction occurred in 0 of 6 extension eyes versus 7 of 11 non-extension eyes (Fisher exact two-sided P ≈ 0.035). In the Firth model (event = extension), < 40% CCT reduction strongly predicted extension (odds ratio 38.5; profile-likelihood 95% CI 2.0-10,000; LR P = 0.004). Non-pachychoroid showed the same direction with wide CIs (odds ratio 14.3; 95% CI 0.99-2,174; LR P = 0.006). Model fit was significant (LR χ² = 15.19, P = 0.0005) and discrimination was good (apparent AUC ≈ 0.97). We prespecified a parsimonious two-predictor model to limit overfitting; adding age, sex, prior photodynamic therapy, or number of prior aflibercept injections did not materially change coefficients or improve AICc (ΔAICc < 2). Eyes without marked early choroidal thinning (<40% CCT reduction at A1) were more likely to extend, whereas marked thinning (≥40%) signaled difficulty extending under T&E regimen after switching to brolucizumab. Given the small sample and few events, estimates should be interpreted cautiously and considered hypothesis-generating, and warrant prospective external validation studies.",10

This clinical trial compared the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of low-dose propranolol versus amitriptyline for episodic migraine prophylaxis over a 3-month period. This randomized, controlled, open-label, prospective, parallel, single-center trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in India. A total of 60 prophylaxis-naïve patients with episodic migraine were randomized 1:1 to receive either low-dose propranolol (80 mg/day) or amitriptyline (10 mg/day). The primary outcome was the improvement in the monthly headache frequency at 3 months from baseline, while the secondary outcomes included improvements from baseline in the proportions of patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in monthly headache days, headache severity, headache-induced disability, monthly rescue medication intake, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness (measured by the average cost-effectiveness ratio [ACER] and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]). At 3 months, propranolol showed a significantly greater reduction in monthly headache frequency compared with amitriptyline (- 3.67 ± 1.47 versus -  2.87 ± 1.36 days, P = 0.03). More patients in the propranolol group (60%) achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in monthly headache days compared with the amitriptyline group (43.33%) (P = 0.02). Propranolol also showed a greater reduction in monthly rescue medication intake (P = 0.01), but differences in headache severity, headache-induced disability, and quality of life were not significant. Both groups experienced mild adverse drug reactions. Cost-effectiveness analysis revealed propranolol had a higher ACER (US $5.44) and ICER (US $0.40/1% reduction) than amitriptyline. In our trial, low-dose propranolol demonstrated superior efficacy to amitriptyline in episodic migraine prophylaxis. Both drugs were well tolerated. Our study suggests that amitriptyline was more cost-effective than propranolol. Clinical Trial Registry-India (Date: 27 October 2020; registration no.: CTRI/2020/01/022972).

[PMID: 40553594] To assess the efficacy and safety of amitriptyline as a prophylactic treatment of migraine in comparison with propranolol and flunarizine. PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched along with gray literature, including internet search. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective studies which included migraine patients were included. Screening and extraction of data were conducted, and the quality of randomized studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RevMan Web was employed for statistical analysis. About nine studies (<i>n</i> = 874), including seven randomized and two nonrandomized studies, were deemed suitable for data synthesis and analysis. As compared to propranolol, amitriptyline administration significantly lowered the monthly frequency, duration, and severity score of migraines. No significant differences were noted between amitriptyline and flunarizine groups for monthly migraine frequency and migraine severity. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse reactions following amitriptyline administration when compared with propranolol and flunarizine. Low-dose amitriptyline is a potent prophylactic treatment option for migraine with respect to frequency, duration, as well as severity of migraine episodes. Its efficacy profile is superior to placebo as well as propranolol and comparable to flunarizine, whereas safety profile is comparable to both propranolol and flunarizine.

[PMID: 40252602] Migraine is a common neurological disorder in children, significantly impacting quality of life and academic performance. The kynurenine pathway, a major metabolic route of tryptophan, plays a critical role in neuroinflammation and neurotransmission, yet its involvement in pediatric migraine remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate alterations in kynurenine pathway metabolites in children with migraine and assess their correlation with headache frequency and severity. A case-control study was conducted including pediatric patients diagnosed with migraine (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 48). Serum levels of tryptophan (TRP) and its kynurenine pathway metabolites-including kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA)-were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS) scores were used to evaluate the functional impact of migraine. Statistical analyses included comparisons between groups and correlation assessments between metabolite levels and clinical parameters. KYN, KYNA, and the KYN/TRP ratio were significantly higher in the migraine group compared to controls (p < 0.05). KYNA/3-HK ratios showed a negative correlation with headache frequency and PedMIDAS scores, whereas 3-HK levels were positively correlated with PedMIDAS scores. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified KYN as a potential biomarker for distinguishing migraine patients from controls, with a sensitivity of 86.7 % and specificity of 45.8 % at a cutoff value of 1415. This study is the first to evaluate kynurenine pathway metabolites in pediatric migraine. The findings suggest that alterations in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, particularly increased KYN and KYNA levels, may serve as compensatory mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology. Future studies should explore the therapeutic implications of targeting the kynurenine pathway in pediatric migraine treatment.

[PMID: 40229741] Migraine significantly impairs quality of life, reduces workplace productivity, and imposes a substantial socio-economic burden. The severity of migraine correlates with its impact on quality of life and healthcare costs, emphasizing the need for adequate management. In the past, primary care services often faced issues of inadequate treatment. This study evaluates differences in pharmacological recommendations for acute and preventive migraine treatments across primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings. This cross-sectional study involves patients with confirmed migraine (with or without aura) visiting the tertiary headache center at Charité Berlin between 12/2015 and 01/2023 for the first time. Data on headache characteristics and prior treatments for acute and prophylactic treatments at primary/secondary and recommendations from tertiary level of care were retrieved from medical letters written after first consultation. Among 1,047 migraine patients (42 years, 84% women), 99% had received treatment for acute migraine attacks by primary/secondary care facilities, and 96% were using it at their first consultation, with 63% advised to use a triptan. The average number of triptans tested prior to referral was 1 ± 0.99. Prophylactic treatment was prescribed to 52% of patients by primary/secondary care facilities, with an average of 1.2 ± 1.6 prior prophylactic attempts per patient, and 44% were actively using it at the time of consultation. More than two thirds of patients with over four monthly migraine days were not using prophylactic treatment at referral. Tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blocker and, anticonvulsants were prescribed significantly more often in primary/secondary care settings while Onabotulinumtoxin-A and Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide(-receptor) antibodies were more commonly initiated in tertiary care. Treatment recommendations from primary/secondary settings were revised in 77% of patients following consultation at the tertiary headache clinic. Compared to previous studies, the overall prescription of acute and prophylactic therapies in primary and secondary care facilities has improved. Further progress is needed in expanding the range of triptans and prophylactic treatments tested before referring patients to specialized centers. However, given the selected study population, the findings may not be fully applicable to all patients treated in primary/secondary care, especially those already receiving adequate care without being referred to specialized settings.

[PMID: 39919799] Depressive disorders are very common psychiatric disorders that are usually well treatable. However, special attention is required if the depressive symptoms do not improve despite guideline-compliant treatment and if brain structural changes can be detected on neuroimaging.We report on a genetically newly diagnosed 63-year-old patient with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) with a two-decade course of severe affective symptoms in the absence of classical somatic disease characteristics although we found a pathogenic variant in the EGFr 4 domain of the NOTCH3 protein.CADASIL is a rare inherited disease of the small cerebral vessels which is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. The disease typically begins in young adulthood and is characterized by ischemic strokes, migraine-like headaches, psychiatric disturbance, and cognitive decline. Pathogenic variants in NOTCH3 EGFr domains 1-6 are associated with a more severe somatic phenotype. Our case report highlights the phenotypic heterogeneity of CADASIL with only psychiatric symptoms despite mutation within EGFr domain 4; therefore, CADASIL should be considered in the presence of affective disorders, lack of response to antidepressants and typical MR changes.

[PMID: 39520634] Anxiety and depression are frequently associated with migraine, and antidepressant use can complicate treatment. These analyses assessed the safety and tolerability of rimegepant in participants with migraine and anxiety and/or depression, or using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or other antidepressants. Data were from a phase II/III safety study of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. Participants with a history of 2-14 migraine attacks per month of moderate or severe pain intensity self-administered rimegepant 75 mg as needed up to once daily for up to 52 weeks. These post hoc subgroup analyses assessed safety according to self-reported history of anxiety (yes or no) or depression (yes or no), and current use of SSRIs (yes or no) or other antidepressants (yes or no). Of 1800 treated participants, 23.2% (n = 417) had a self-reported history of anxiety, 23.7% (n = 426) had a self-reported history of depression, and 11.2% (n = 202) reported both anxiety and depression. A total of 10.1% (n = 181) of participants were using an SSRI, 10.8% (n = 195) were using other antidepressants, and 1.8% (n = 32) were using both. Across the subgroups with anxiety, without anxiety, with depression, without depression, using SSRIs, not using SSRIs, using other antidepressants, and not using other antidepressants, respectively, similar proportions of participants reported adverse events (67.1%, 58.4%, 62.0%, 60.0%, 64.1%, 60.0%, 66.2%, 59.8%), serious adverse events (3.6%, 2.3%, 2.8%, 2.5%, 3.3%, 2.5%, 5.1%, 2.3%), and discontinuation of rimegepant due to adverse events (4.1%, 2.2%, 3.1%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 2.4%, 3.1%, 2.6%). Numerical improvements in a variety of participant-reported outcomes were also observed at weeks 12 and 52. Rimegepant showed favorable safety and tolerability in adults with migraine and a history of anxiety and/or depression and with SSRI and/or other antidepressant use. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03266588.

[PMID: 39327755] To evaluate the effectiveness of nortriptyline regimen and migraine dietary/lifestyle modifications on dizziness and stress levels in patients diagnosed with vestibular migraine (VM). A total of 35 patients diagnosed with definite VM based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders were included in this intervention study. Patients self-selected to receive either nortriptyline regimen alone (10-40 mg daily with biweekly escalation) (group A, n = 17) or migraine dietary/lifestyle modifications alone (group B, n = 18). Main outcome measures were dizziness severity and stress level measured by the visual analog scale (VAS). At 4-week post-treatment, dizziness decreased from 6.0 ± 2.5 to 4.2 ± 3.4 (p = 0.069) in group A and from 8.7 ± 1.5 to 3.6 ± 3.0 (p < 0.001) in group B. VAS for stress changed from 5.5 ± 1.3 to 5.4 ± 2.9 (p = 0.93) and from 6.9 ± 3.2 to 5.0 ± 2.7 (p = 0.025) in groups A and B, respectively. The δ values of the VAS score for dizziness were 1.8 ± 3.7 and 5.1 ± 3.1 and the δ values of the VAS score for stress were 0.06 ± 2.9 and 1.9 ± 3.3 in groups A and B, respectively. Quality of life (QOL) improved in 88% patients in group A and 94% patients in group B. Nortriptyline, at a maximum dose of 40 mg, effectively alleviates patient symptoms, while a migraine diet and lifestyle modifications notably reduce vertiginous symptoms and stress levels in VM patients in 4 weeks. Both interventions are equally effective in ameliorating the QOL of patients. The ideal treatment for patients would likely need to include both medication and diet/lifestyle changes.

[PMID: 38666648] Major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic pain are highly comorbid and bidirectionally related. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is effective in treating MDD, but additional research is needed to determine if chronic pain interferes with rTMS for MDD. Participants were 124 veterans ( Mage = 49.14, SD = 13.83) scheduled for 30 sessions of rTMS across 6 weeks. Depression severity was monitored weekly using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Having any pain diagnosis, low back pain, or headache/migraine were assessed by chart review. We fit latent basis models to estimate total change by pain diagnosis in depression scores and quadratic latent growth models to examine differences in growth rates. Then, we computed χ2 tests of group differences in response (PHQ-9 reduction ≥50%) and remission rates (final PHQ-9 < 5). A total of 92 participants (74%) had a documented pain diagnosis, 58 (47%) had low back pain, and 32 (26%) had headache/migraine. In growth models, depression scores initially decreased (linear slope estimate = -2.04, SE = 0.26, p < .0001), but the rate of decrease slowed over time (quadratic slope estimate = 0.18, SE = 0.04, p < .001). Overall change was not different as a function of any pain diagnosis ( p = .42), low back pain (p = .11 ), or headache/migraine ( p = .28). However, we found that low back pain was a negative predictor of response ( p = .032). These data support rTMS as a viable treatment option for comorbid populations. Although patients with comorbid chronic pain conditions are likely to receive benefit from rTMS for depression, adjunctive pain treatment may be indicated.

[PMID: 38641932] Pediatric migraine prophylaxis is indicated when headaches are frequent and/or disabling. We aimed to conduct a study to compare the efficacy of cinnarizine and amitriptyline in pediatric migraine prophylaxis. In a randomized, double-blind trial, patients aged 4-17 years with migraine who were eligible for prophylaxis enrolled. The primary outcome was a reduction response rate of ≥50% with <i>p</i> < 0.005 with respect to headache characteristics. The secondary outcome was migraine disability assessment. We evaluated patients every four weeks for three months: T1: week 4, T2: week 8 and T3: week 12. The safety profile was also assessed. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to each group. However, 43 patients completed the trial. Headache frequency decreased in amitriptyline group more effectively in T1 (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Amitriptyline was more successful in reducing the headache duration in all three periods (<i>p</i> < 0.005). There was no significant difference in severity improvement and reducing disability score between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.005). No serious adverse events were observed. Both medications are effective in ameliorating migraine headaches and related disabilities. However, amitriptyline appears be a preferable option over cinnarizine, given its faster onset of action, efficacy in reducing headache duration and longer-lasting effects.<b>Trial Registration:</b> The study was registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) under the code IRCT-20191112045413N1.

[PMID: 41187342] The efficacy of artesunate + amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether + lumefantrine (AL) for treating malaria was investigated in Madagascar in 2020. A randomized parallel-group study was conducted at four health centers (Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, and Matanga in the southeastern region and Ankazomborona in the northwestern region). The therapeutic efficacy and safety of ASAQ and AL were assessed using the WHO protocol, with a 28-day follow-up period. Children aged 6 months to 14 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria were randomly assigned to receive either ASAQ or AL. Genotyping assays for the pfK13 gene were conducted on P. falciparum isolates obtained from dry blood samples collected on Day 0. Of 765 enrolled patients, 709 (92.7%) reached the study endpoint. Among the per-protocol population, crude adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rates were 99%, 99%, 100%, and 100% for Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, Matanga, and Ankazomborona, respectively, in the ASAQ group and 98%, 91%, 90%, and 100% for the same locations, respectively, in the AL group. Polymerase chain reaction-corrected ACPR rates were 100% for the ASAQ group at all study sites, whereas for the AL group, they were 98.8% in Antsenavolo, 97.6% in Vohitromby, 100% in Matanga, and 100% in Ankazomborona. Day 3 slide positivity rates were 0%, 1%, 1%, and 0% for Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, Matanga, and Ankazomborona, respectively. During follow-up, mild and moderate adverse events, including gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain and vomiting) and headache, were reported in 10.2% (72/709) of patients. Of 727 samples successfully analyzed for pfK13, no mutation associated with artemisinin resistance was observed. The study results reveal that ASAQ and AL remain safe and efficacious for treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Madagascar.",10
Antimicrobial agents are less effective due to the pressure of antimicrobial usage.,antimicrobial resistance AND overuse of antibiotics AND pressure of antimicrobial use AND reduced efficacy of antimicrobials,"40084881,33156838,24646082,41187250,41187231,41187189,41187185,41187178,41187143,41187077","[PMID: 40084881] Antibiotic resistance, driven by misuse and overuse of antibiotics, is one of the greatest threats against human health. The antimicrobial pressure during prolonged antibiotic treatment of chronic bacterial infections selects for resistance. While antibiotic combinations may reduce resistance emergence, antibiotic-tolerant persister cells can serve as a reservoir for resistance development. Therefore, targeting these cells with anti-persister drugs might provide a novel strategy for resistance prevention. In this study, we conducted 42 days of adaptive laboratory evolution using <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> exposed to rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, daptomycin, and vancomycin, alone or in combination with the anti-persister drug mitomycin C. We monitored antibiotic susceptibility daily and assessed phenotypic changes in growth and biofilm formation in evolved strains. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations linked to antibiotic resistance and phenotypic shifts. Rifampicin resistance developed within a few days, while ciprofloxacin and daptomycin emerged in approximately 3 weeks. Treatments with vancomycin or mitomycin C resulted in minimal changes in susceptibility. While combination therapy delayed resistance, it did not fully prevent it. Notably, the combination of rifampicin with mitomycin C maintained rifampicin susceptibility throughout the long-term evolution experiment. Sub-inhibitory antibiotic treatments selected for both previously characterized and novel mutations, including unprecedented alterations in the nucleotide excision repair system and azoreductase following mitomycin C exposure. The delayed resistance development observed with combination therapy, particularly mitomycin C's ability to suppress rifampicin resistance, suggests potential therapeutic applications. Future studies should evaluate the clinical efficacy of anti-persister drugs in preventing resistance across different bacterial pathogens and infection models.

[PMID: 33156838] Development of drug resistance in opportunistic pathogens is one of the major healthcare challenges associated with infection management. Combination therapy has many advantages due to the simultaneous action of two drugs on two separate cellular targets. However, selection of the drugs should offer safety and synergistic interaction against most of the strains. Here, the efficacy of antibiotics in combination with quercetin, a natural flavonoid capable of targeting quorum sensing was tested against biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains previously isolated from catheter associated urinary tract infection. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility pattern, synergistic effect of quercetin with selected antibiotics (levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, gentamycin, tobramycin and amikacin) was tested at the fractional concentrations of MIC by the checkerboard method and the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICi) was calculated to estimate the synergistic effect. Effect of the synergistic combinations were further tested using time-kill assay, and against biofilm formation and biofilm cell viability. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using Human Embryonic Kidney 293T cells (HEK-293T) using the effective drug combinations with respective controls. The biofilm formation and biofilm cell viability were drastically affected with quercetin and selected antibiotics combinations with ≥80% inhibition. In vitro infection studies showed that all the strains could exert significant cell killing (68 to 85%) and the drug combinations decreased the infection rate significantly by reducing the cell killing effect of P. aeruginosa (p<0.05). The synergistic effect of quercetin is attributed to its quorum sensing inhibitory properties. These findings indicate that quercetin along with existing antibiotics can potentiate the treatment against P. aeruginosa infection and may reduce the selection pressure due to antibiotic overuse.

[PMID: 24646082] Antibiotics are the medical wonder of our age, but an increasing frequency of resistance among key pathogens is rendering them less effective. If this trend continues the consequences for cancer patients, organ transplant patients, and indeed the general community could be disastrous. The problem is complex, involving abuse and overuse of antibiotics (selecting for an increasing frequency of resistant bacteria), together with a lack of investment in discovery and development (resulting in an almost dry drug development pipeline). Remedial approaches to the problem should include taking measures to reduce the selective pressures for resistance development, and taking measures to incentivize renewed investment in antibiotic discovery and development. Bringing new antibiotics to the clinic is critical because this is currently the only realistic therapy that can ensure the level of infection control required for many medical procedures. Here we outline the complex process involved in taking a potential novel antibiotic from the initial discovery of a hit molecule, through lead and candidate drug development, up to its entry into phase I clinical trials. The stringent criteria that a successful drug must meet, balancing high efficacy in vivo against a broad spectrum of pathogens, with minimal liabilities against human targets, explain why even with sufficient investment this process is prone to a high failure rate. This emphasizes the need to create a well-funded antibiotic discovery and development pipeline that can sustain the continuous delivery of novel candidate drugs into clinical trials, to ensure the maintenance of the advanced medical procedures we currently take for granted.

[PMID: 41187250] Antibiotics remain a cornerstone in the management of dermatologic conditions such as acne and hidradenitis suppurativa, underscoring the need for responsible antibiotic stewardship. This article explores the &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; of antibiotics, highlighting their role in disrupting the gut microbiome, elevating risks for infections like Clostridium difficile, and increasing resistance in Cutibacterium acnes and other microbes. Emerging evidence also links antibiotic use to reduced vaccine efficacy and diminished responses to cancer immunotherapy. To mitigate these risks, dermatologists should prioritize narrow-spectrum antibiotics and incorporate combination topical therapies containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO), such as the triple-combination of clindamycin, adapalene, and BPO, to help curb antibiotic resistance. Prudent antibiotic use, combined with topical regimens utilizing BPO, optimizes treatment outcomes while minimizing systemic adverse effects and resistance. Ongoing education and research are essential to refine prescribing practices that balance therapeutic benefits with long-term patient and public health.

[PMID: 41187231] The only approved triple-combination acne treatment &ndash; clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/adapalene 0.15%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1% (CAB) gel - demonstrated efficacy/safety in 12-week clinical trials. However, real-world treatment may require 6 months for maximum benefits in some cases. Since long-term antibiotic use can lead to resistance in the causative Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes), this analysis evaluated the effect of long-term CAB use on C. acnes. Pooled data from 2 identical, 24-week, single-center, open-label studies evaluated once-daily CAB in participants aged &ge;12 years with moderate/severe acne (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] of 3/4). Plates inoculated with central forehead swabs were monitored for C. acnes colony formation. Clindamycin susceptibility was assessed via minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values using Epsilometer tests; MIC &ge;8 &mu;g/mL indicated resistance. Of 50 participants enrolled, 45 completed the studies. At baseline, C. acnes strains were isolated from 82% (37/45) of participants. After 24 weeks, CAB-treated participants with cultivable isolates decreased by nearly half to 44% (20/45). For susceptible strains isolated at week 24, MIC values remained low (mean, 0.19 &mu;g/mL). Only 1 participant without growth at baseline had cultivable C. acnes at week 24, deemed clindamycin-susceptible. Only the 5 participants (11%) with resistant C. acnes isolates at baseline had resistant isolates at study end, though all 5 had acne improvements at week 24 (IGA decrease, 1-3 points; lesion reductions, 40%-100%). Long-term CAB gel treatment did not lead to antibiotic resistance development and was efficacious in participants with resistant isolates at baseline, suggesting CAB is well suited for long-term acne treatment.

[PMID: 41187189] With the large-scale use of antibiotics, the detection rate and mortality of carbapenem resistant Escherichia coli (CR-EC) have gradually increased. This study investigated the molecular characteristics and prevalence of CR-EC in order to supplement the isolated data of CR-EC in Hangzhou, China. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined by microbroth dilution method. The drug resistance genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. The transferability of plasmid was verified by the conjugation test and genetic homology was detected by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The whole genome was sequenced (WGS) using the Illumina MiSeq technology. A total of 8 non-duplicated CR-EC isolates were collected, and all exhibited a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Two different New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) variants, blaNDM-5 and blaNDM-13, were found with detection rates of 62.5% and 12.5%, respectively. The success rate of conjugation was 100% (6/6). Homology analysis showed that there was no widespread cloning outbreak of CR-EC, and blaNDM-5-ST410 was prevalent in the local area as a dominant group. WGS also indicated the rate of occurrence of resistance genes carrying resistance for more types of antibiotics, as well as exposed potential virulence risks. This was a survey on the prevalence and molecular characteristics of CR-EC in Hangzhou. blaNDM-like production combined with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) and/or AmpC was the main resistance mechanism of CR-EC in this area. The dominant blaNDM-5-ST410 requires enhanced attention. The horizontal transformation of plasmids, complex drug resistance, and potential virulence risks also need close attention.

[PMID: 41187185] Drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii poses a global health crisis, especially in Asia. It has a propensity to become clonally endemic in healthcare settings. However, its clonal distribution in a broad geographic area is unclear. The clonality of A. baumannii was characterized nationwide by collecting 572 drug-resistant A. baumannii from 18 hospitals across Thailand regions between 2017-2018 and genotyping them by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in association with carbapenemase genes data. The results depicted 12 types of RAPD banding. Strikingly, two types were predominant in all hospitals (79%). Of those, 96% harbored the blaOXA-23 gene. The banding pattern matched the preexisting strain in the institution, suggesting an ongoing nationwide circulation of the resistant clone. Interestingly, a unique banding type was identified in high proportion in two nearby hospitals in the northern region (21%, 53/252). Two isolates with the same banding pattern were also identified in a hospital in Bangkok, suggesting the possibility of transfer between regions. Most of the subset of isolates analyzed belonged to sequence type (ST) 2, the most prominent ST in the Asia-Pacific region. This study demonstrated continuous dissemination of predominating A. baumannii clones across the country, and the emergence of endemic hospital-specific clones, all with high burdens of blaOXA-23; suggesting a strong selection for these resistance determinants. In addition, genotyping with RAPD can be a simple and cost-effective epidemiological tool with efficient discriminatory power for A. baumannii in developing countries.

[PMID: 41187178] The hospital environment is an important source of nosocomial infections. Surfaces in the hospital facilities may be considered as microbial reservoirs that can cause patient contamination. This study aimed to evaluate the microbiological quality of surfaces and equipment in the Mohammed V Hospital, located in Al-Hoceima, Morocco. A total of 360 samples of surfaces were collected by swabbing from 5 service departments (intensive care unit (ICU), maternity, neonatology, operating room, and pediatric) over a period of 1 year (January-December 2021). The samples were analyzed at the provincial public health laboratory of Al-Hoceima. Isolation and identification of bacteria were performed according to conventional bacteriology methods. The results indicated that 34.4% (124/360) samples were contaminated. The ICU was the most contaminated service and the frequency of contaminated samples was 50%. The most contaminated sampling sites were soap for hand washing (27.4%), trolleys (25.8%), and sinks (22.6%). Gram-positive bacteria represented 51.6% of the contaminants. The most isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.5%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.4%). Extended spectrum beta lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae represented 31.7% of the contaminants. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 17.6% of the contaminants. This study provided important data that can guide the nosocomial infection control committee to manage the risks related to contaminated hospital surfaces through the establishment of an adequate risk analysis strategy.

[PMID: 41187143] Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a global public health crisis. Evaluating intervention impact requires accurate estimates of how the AMR burden will change over time, given likely demographic shifts. This study aimed to provide an estimate of future AMR burden in Europe, investigating resistance variation by age and sex and the impact of interventions to achieve the proposed United Nations (UN) political declaration targets. Using data from 12,807,473 bloodstream infection (BSI) susceptibility tests from routine surveillance in Europe, we estimate age- and sex-specific rates of change in BSI incidence for the 8 bacteria included in European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) surveillance over 2015-2019. This was used to project incidence rates by age and sex for 2022-2050 and, with demographic projections, to generate estimates of BSI burden (2022-2050). Two Bayesian hierarchical models were fitted across 38 bacteria-antibiotic combinations to the 2015-2019 resistance proportion of BSI by year and at the country-level with and without age and sex disaggregation. Inputting the incidence estimates into the ""agesex"" and ""base"" model, respectively, we sampled 1,000 model estimates of resistant BSI burden by age, sex, and country to determine the importance of age and sex disaggregation. We explored Intervention scenarios consisting of a 1, 5, or 20 per 100,000 per year reduction in infection incidence rate of change or 5 per 100,000 per year reduction in those older than 64 years. Overall, in Europe, BSI incidence rates are predicted to increase more in men than women across 6 of the 8 bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium were the exception) and are projected to increase more dramatically in older age groups (74+ years) but stabilise or decline in younger age groups. We project huge country-level variation in resistance burden to 2050, with opposing trends in different countries for the same bacteria-antibiotic combinations (e.g., aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter spp. ranged from a relative difference of 0.34 to 15.38 by 2030). Not accounting for age and sex results in differing resistance burden projections, with 47% of bacteria-antibiotic combinations estimated to have fewer resistant BSIs by 2030 compared to a model with age and sex. Not including age or sex resistance patterns results in fewer male cases for 76% (29/38) of the combinations compared to 11% (4/38) for women. We also saw age-based associations in projections with bigger differences at older ages. Achieving a 10% reduction in resistant BSI incidence by 2030 (equivalent to the UN 10% mortality target) was possible only for 68.4% (26/38) of bacteria-antibiotic combinations even with large reductions in BSI incidence rate of change of -20 per 100,000 per year. In some cases, a 10% reduction was followed by a rebound, with the resistant BSI burden exceeding previous levels by 2050. Limitations include reliance on European data and current trends, and the exclusion of factors such as comorbidities or ethnicity. Including country-specific, age- and sex-specific resistance levels alongside projected demographic shifts has a large impact on resistant BSI burden projections in Europe to 2030. Reducing this AMR infection burden by 10% will require substantial reductions in infection incidence rates.

[PMID: 41187077] Drug resistance poses a major global health challenge, necessitating the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The main challenge is to predict drug-resistant mutations and design drugs that retain efficacy against such evolving targets. Our previous effort in computing the vitality value has provided a framework in assessing drug resistance. While promising, the approach lacked accuracy due to insufficient information about mutation tendencies and protein stability. In this study, we used the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database and observed that drug resistance, usually quantified as [Formula: see text], exhibits a positive correlation with the Maximum Entropy energy, [Formula: see text]. However, both drug resistance and vitality are also correlated with the number of mutations, indicating that the virus cannot easily gain resistance through specific mutational pathways and must sacrifice stability and function to escape inhibition. To overcome this number dependence, we looked for a system with less extensive mutagenesis and chose HCV protease. In this case, resistance substitutions cluster at low [Formula: see text] values, reflecting a limited mutational space. This restricted landscape enables [Formula: see text] to predict evolutionary pathways of resistance and to guide the identification of robust therapeutic candidates.",10
Autologous transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells has better graft function than induction therapy with anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibodies.,autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplantation AND graft function AND induction therapy AND anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibodies,"41187381,41187300,41186970,41186829,41186718,41186714,41186660,41186643,41186623,41186530","[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187300] The unicameral bone cyst (UBC) is a benign lesion that affects children and adolescents between 4 and 14 years of age. They are defined by an osteolytic cavity filled with serous fluid, enclosed by a thin fibrous membrane. Moreover, they are closely associated with skeletal growth and biomechanical stresses during development. Surgical management of UBCs is crucial, particularly in weight-bearing bones, to reduce the risk of pathological fractures and maintain structural stability. These surgical procedures (such as curretage and bone grafting) aim to restore bone stability, prevent recurrence, and enhance long-term functional outcomes. Studying UBCs provides insight into the natural history and behavior of benign bone lesions, emphasizing the importance of growth and mechanical factors in skeletal pathology. This case report seeks to present our experience in managing UBCs of the proximal femur in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, focusing on the tips needed in the surgical technique that can aid surgeons in the management of such cases.

[PMID: 41186970] In stages II and III hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer, selecting patients for primary surgery (PS) or neoadjuvant therapy remains challenging. This study assessed the occurrence of minimally invasive surgery in the case of PS, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET), and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). This cohort study included women diagnosed with stages II and III, HR+ breast cancer in 2020-2022 in the Netherlands. Women with positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) cancer were excluded. Outcomes focused on surgical techniques and additional treatment. Of the 7809 patients, 4046 (51.8%) underwent PS, 956 (12.2%) received NET and 2807 (35.9%) NACT. NET patients were older (median: 71 years [33-94]), while NACT patients had larger tumors and more lymph node involvement (p < .001). Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was the first procedure in 2153 (53.2%) PS women, in 694 (72.6%) NET women and 1564 (55.7%) NACT cases. There was no difference regarding free surgical margins in NET versus NACT patients (p = .421). After adjusting for T-stage, BCS occurred significantly more frequently after NET (p < .001). Minimal invasive surgery on the axilla was common after NET (83.9%) and NACT (81.5%). In the PS group, 85% received adjuvant systemic therapy. Optimizing patient selection for neoadjuvant strategies could reduce surgical morbidity. NET was frequently associated with BCS, showed comparable surgical margin outcomes to NACT, and contributed to reduced axillary surgery. These findings suggest that NET is an effective strategy, compared to PS, to facilitate less invasive surgery on the breast and axilla, in HR+/HER2-, stages II and III breast cancer.

[PMID: 41186829] Given the high risk of relapse for Philadelphia-negative (Ph-negative) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is often recommended following first complete remission (CR1) in high-risk patients. However, in the era of measurable residual disease (MRD) testing, allo-HCT may not be indicated for patients with standard-risk disease. Here we review the use of allo-HCT and other consolidative approaches for standard- and high-risk Ph-negative ALL, based on MRD following induction therapy. Allo-HCT is strongly indicated for patients with high-risk Ph-negative ALL, especially those who are MRD positive at end of induction. Ongoing trials using cellular and immune therapies such as blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have shown promising results in deepening response and decreasing relapse. Further, these agents have demonstrated overall manageable safety profiles. The role for allo-HCT following CR1 in patients with standard risk Ph-negative ALL is evolving with advances in therapeutic approaches. MRD is emerging as a critical prognostic factor regardless of treatment strategy, thus questioning the necessity of transplant in MRD-negative patients. With the advances in safety and accessibility of allo-HCT as well as novel therapeutics, overall outcomes in ALL continue to improve.

[PMID: 41186718] This study aims to compare, select, and investigate MRI-based multiregional radiomics model to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) in Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). This retrospective study included 245 patients who underwent rectal MRI examination before nCRT were recruited and split into training (hospital 1, n = 177) and external validation cohort (hospital 2, n = 68). Pretreatment T2WI and ADC images were used to manually delineate volumetric region of interest. Intratumoral, peritumoral-2 mm, peritumoral-3 mm, peritumoral-5 mm, and peritumoral-mesorectal fat (MRF) radiomics features were extracted. Clinical model was built based on clinical and MRI features. Diagnosis performance was compared among models. 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curve. cN stage (odds ratio = 2.62, 95%CI,1.13-6.11) was a risk factor to construct clinical model. Peritumoral-3 mm radiomics model showed slightly higher performance than peritumoral-2 mm, peritumoral-5 mm, and peritumoral-MRF radiomics model, but there were no significant differences (all P > 0.05). Combining T2WI and ADC based intratumoral and peritumoral-3 mm radiomics model showed good performance with AUC of 0.793 and 0.759 in training and external validation cohort, respectively. The clinical-radiomics combined model showed better performance than clinical model (AUC, 0.829 vs. 0.599; P < 0.001) and better performance to the intratumoral and peritumoral-3 mm radiomics model (AUC, 0.829 vs. 0.793; P = 0.04) in training cohort. And the clinical-radiomics combined model showed better performance than clinical model (AUC, 0.793 vs. 0.599; P < 0.001) and better performance to the intratumoral and peritumoral-3 mm radiomics model (AUC, 0.795 vs. 0.759; P = 0.21) in external validation cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed high-risk patients defined by nomogram based non-pCR had a worse 3-year RFS than that of low-risk patients. The nomogram integrating T2WI and ADC based intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics signatures and cN stage could preoperative predict pCR. The nomogram based pCR was associated with 3-year RFS.

[PMID: 41186714] To evaluate whether deep learning-based combined noise reduction and contrast enhancement reconstruction (DLR) improves image quality and resectability prediction accuracy compared to conventional iterative reconstruction (IR) in post-neoadjuvant pancreatic cancer CT assessment. This retrospective study included 114 patients with pancreatic cancer following neoadjuvant therapy. Contrast-enhanced CT images were reconstructed using conventional IR and vendor-neutral ClariACE. Three abdominal radiologists independently assessed image quality (based on 8 parameters: tumor conspicuity, tumor margin, image noise, sharpness of the main pancreatic duct, arterial depiction, venous depiction, plasticity and overall image quality) and determined tumor resectability with confidence levels. Quantitative analysis included aortic and portal venous attenuation measurements and pancreas-to-tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Diagnostic performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with DeLong's test. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and reader confidence were compared using McNemar's test. DLR demonstrated significantly superior vessel enhancement (p < 0.001) and improved CNR (p < 0.001) versus conventional IR. Two readers consistently rated DLR images higher across all qualitative categories (p < 0.001) except plasticity, while the third reader favored DLR in five of eight parameters (p < 0.001 to 0.020). However, all readers noted increased artificial appearance in DLR images (p < 0.001). Despite image quality improvements, no significant differences were observed in resectability assessment accuracy (62.3%-65.8%), AUC values (0.485-0.520), or high-confidence diagnosis rates between reconstruction methods. Although deep learning-based combined noise reduction and contrast enhancement reconstruction significantly improved quantitative and subjective image quality metrics, it did not enhance diagnostic accuracy for predicting R0 resectability in post-neoadjuvant pancreatic cancer patients.

[PMID: 41186660] Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have survival benefits for patients with high-risk (High-risk disease is defined per the phase III OlympiA trial as follows: for triple-negative breast cancer, residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or node-positive or ≥ 2 cm tumors after adjuvant chemotherapy; for hormone receptor-positive disease, four or more positive nodes after adjuvant chemotherapy or a CPS + EG score ≥ 3 after incomplete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The CPS + EG score accounts for clinical/pathologic stage, ER status, and grade (Giaquinto et al. in CA Cancer J Clin 72:524-541, 2022)), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer (eBC) with germline BReast CAncer gene mutations (gBRCAm). However, many patients are unaware of their gBRCA status; this can impact eligibility for targeted treatment. We sought to evaluate patient preferences for BRCA testing and treatment decision-making as they relate to HER2-negative eBC. We conducted an online survey, including a best-worst scaling exercise (BWS) and discrete-choice experiment (DCE), among patients with self-reported HER2-negative eBC residing in the USA who were either untested, unsure if they were tested, or tested positive for the gBRCAm. The BWS generated a rank ordering of 16 barriers and facilitators to BRCA testing. The DCE evaluated patient preferences for adjuvant therapies versus no treatment based on seven treatment attributes: invasive disease-free survival, targeted treatment, nausea risk, risk of serious side effects, regimen, treatment duration, and cost. BWS and DCE exercises were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian models. Among the 359 women included in our sample, the top facilitators for BRCA testing were determining eligibility for targeted therapy that may prevent or delay metastasis, a physician's recommendation, and absence of out-of-pocket costs (OOPC). In contrast, the top barriers were an OOPC of $250, potential anxiety from test results, and the possibility of a 3- to 4-week delay in treatment. The DCE showed that most participants preferred adjuvant treatment (77.6%) over no treatment, and reducing treatment OOPC from $900 to $0, reducing the risk of serious side effects from 77 to 24%, and having a BRCA-targeted treatment influenced treatment choice most. Individuals reported that a key benefit of BRCA testing was the insight it provided into their treatment options, allowing for more personalized care. However, OOPC was a barrier to testing. Their choice to receive adjuvant therapy was most influenced by OOPC, followed by the tolerability of the treatment and the ability to receive a targeted therapy.

[PMID: 41186643] Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) lacks consistent biomarkers to monitor treatment response and predict survival. Metabolically active extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying tumor-specific KRAS mutations offer promise as disease-specific biomarkers. Informed by genomic profiling of tumor tissue, plasma samples were prospectively collected from 44 patients, with confirmed KRAS-mutated PDAC, undergoing neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) followed by surgery between 2019 and 2021. Samples were obtained at diagnosis, post-NAT, and 1 month post surgery. EVs were isolated using lipid nanoprobe technology, and EV-associated KRAS mutations were detected using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Patients were grouped on the basis of temporal changes in EV-associated KRAS mutation allele frequency (MAF): no KRAS detected (ND), decreasing MAF (DD), and increasing MAF (ID). Among 44 patients, 29 (65.9%) were ND, 8 (18.2%) DD, and 7 (15.9%) ID. Detectable EV-associated KRAS MAF was found in 21%, 30%, and 50% of patients with stages I, II, and III PDAC. No significant differences were noted in demographic or clinical variables (p > 0.05). The ND group had the longest restricted mean disease-free survival (rmDFS: 31.2 months), followed by DD (27.8 months) and ID (9.8 months; p = 0.010). Similarly, restricted mean overall survival (rmOS) was longest in the ND (40.3 months), followed by DD (35.7 months) and ID (17.7 months; p = 0.012). On multivariable analysis, increasing EV-KRAS MAF (ID group) independently predicted inferior rmDFS [hazard ratio (HR): 6.14; p = 0.001] and rmOS (HR: 6.95; p = 0.002). Temporal increase of EV-KRAS MAF is a significant predictor of reduced DFS and OS in PDAC. Integrating EV-KRAS mutation allele frequency dynamics analysis with current biomarkers such as carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) could improve treatment monitoring and survival prognostication.

[PMID: 41186623] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by continuous cognitive deterioration, primarily resulting from the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau-induced neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Recent studies have also highlighted histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) as a critical suppressor of synaptic plasticity. Although pharmacological inhibition of HDAC3 has been shown to facilitate long-term potentiation (LTP), the precise relationship between HDAC3 activity and AMPA receptor signaling, key components in LTP induction and maintenance, remains insufficiently understood. Electroacupuncture (EA), known to modulate epigenetic markers like H3K9/H3K27 acetylation and HDAC3/4 activity, may offer therapeutic potential by targeting these pathways. Here, we investigated EA's effects on AD-related pathology in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, focusing on HDAC3-AMPA receptor interactions in synaptic plasticity. Behavioral assays (Morris water maze) and electrophysiological recordings revealed that EA improved spatial learning ability and reinstated LTP in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Mechanistically, EA reduced hippocampal HDAC3 expression while upregulating GluR1/GluR2 subunits and increasing acetylated H3K9K14/H3 levels, suggesting HDAC3-mediated transcriptional regulation of AMPA receptor genes. Co-immunoprecipitation assays further supported HDAC3's physical interaction with AMPA receptor components. Crucially, conditional knockout of HDAC3 in neurons rescued both LTP impairments and memory deficits, reinforcing its pivotal role in synaptic dysfunction. Our findings unveil a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby EA mitigates AD-associated synaptic damage by suppressing HDAC3 and enhancing AMPA receptor-dependent plasticity, highlighting HDAC3 as a promising therapeutic target for AD intervention.

[PMID: 41186530] Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the management of hepatocellular carcinoma. Landmark trials, including IMbrave150 and HIMALAYA, have established combination ICI therapies as the standard of care for advanced HCC. Beyond these indications, ICIs are now being explored as neoadjuvant therapies for liver transplantation, offering potential benefits in downstaging tumors and serving as bridging therapies for patients outside traditional transplant eligibility criteria. While early evidence from case reports and trials highlights promising oncologic and survival outcomes, the current understanding of ICI use before LT introduces new, unexplored challenges. Allograft rejection, safety concerns regarding immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and the effective management of the complex interplay between immunosuppression and immune therapy represent ongoing themes of discussion. The tumor microenvironment and immunomolecular profiles, which critically influence ICI efficacy, remain the true cornerstones of patient stratification yet to be fully understood. Additionally, the lack of reliable biomarkers and the limitations of current radiologic criteria complicate treatment planning and response evaluation. Overcoming these obstacles requires multidisciplinary collaboration, refined patient selection strategies, and robust clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of ICIs in this context. This review aims to provide an up-to-date summary of the ever-evolving role of ICIs in LT strategies, offering a comprehensive overview of proposed therapeutic protocols, their oncologic and safety profiles, and the integration of emerging biological insights into clinical practice.",10

In this context, the ability to distinguish between protein interfaces that form stable and unstable complexes is a key step in the design of therapeutic antibodies and vaccines. In recent years, deep learning models have provided advanced tools for biomedical research. This work introduces a novel approach to analyzing antibody-antigen interactions, and in particular SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-targeting antibodies, using a Siamese Neural Network specifically designed to integrate depth maps with geometric descriptors of molecular surfaces. By combining these representations, the model captures geometrical shape complementarity to differentiate between stable and unstable protein complexes. The network was trained using image-based representations of antigens and antibodies interfaces enriched with geometric descriptors, using data that include binders and non-binders of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain. The deep learning network operates by comparing feature vectors representing these molecular surfaces; pairs with closer vectors in feature space are associated with stable interactions, while those with more distant vectors suggest instability. Extensive testing with different configurations achieved an accuracy of 90%, demonstrating the robustness of this approach to predict interactions. This innovative integration of artificial intelligence, depth maps and geometric descriptors offers promising applications for designing novel antibodies and vaccines.

[PMID: 41187066] Mice often serve as valuable surrogate models for studying human reproduction. This study provides a single-cell transcriptomic profile of mouse immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout pregnancy and assesses the similarities and differences between these immune cells and human decidual immune cells. Homeostasis of the immune microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface is essential for pregnancy. Immune cell heterogeneity at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnant mice remains understudied. Here, we perform in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analysis with 120,238 maternal-fetal single cells of mice from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E18.5 and in vitro experiments to establish an immune cell atlas. Macrophages constitute the largest population, with some subsets resembling human counterparts, and the number of Ccr2 + macrophages in the decidua increases as pregnancy progresses. Neutrophils constitute the second largest population, and Ifit1 + N2 neutrophils are localized close to the implantation site during early pregnancy. Three NK cell subsets were identified, including the previously reported NK1.1 - subset. In combination with in vitro experiments, the presence of T and B cells within the decidua was validated. Our work profiles a comprehensive immune cell atlas of the mouse maternal-fetal interface, offering a valuable reference for further investigations.

[PMID: 41186818] T cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major obstacle to effective immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The molecular mechanisms underlying T cell exclusion remain poorly understood. This study identifies RANBP1 as an oncogenic factor in TNBC and investigates its role in modulating T cell infiltration and tumor progression. Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing were used to assess immune cell infiltration associated with RANBP1 expression. RANBP1 protein levels were evaluated in 87 TNBC tumor and adjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess overall survival. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to explore the RANBP1/miR-769-5p/PRUNE2 pathway. scRNA-seq identified 10 cell types in the TNBC TME. High RANBP1 expression correlated with increased tumor cells, B cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells, and reduced T cells. Cell-cell communication was enhanced in the high-RANBP1 group. TCGA and GSE65194 data confirmed decreased CD4⁺ T cells and Tregs in high-RANBP1 tumors. RANBP1 was significantly upregulated in TNBC and associated with poor prognosis. Functional studies showed that RANBP1 promotes TNBC cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, RANBP1 upregulates oncogenic miR-769-5p, which suppresses PRUNE2, a tumor suppressor that normally inhibits TNBC progression. RANBP1 shapes an immunosuppressive microenvironment in TNBC by reducing T cell infiltration through the miR-769-5p/PRUNE2 axis. These findings reveal a novel immune escape mechanism and suggest that targeting RANBP1 may enhance immunotherapy efficacy in TNBC.

[PMID: 41186316] Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a common symptom and may be an early sign of systemic sclerosis (SSc). To identify biomarkers distinguishing whether RP is associated with definitive SSc, we used phosphospecific flow cytometry to measure phosphorylated (p) signalling molecules [signal transducers and activators of transcription (pSTAT3, pSTAT6, pSTAT4), pSmad2/3, nuclear factor-κB (pNF-κB)] in peripheral blood leucocytes of RP patients undergoing nailfold videocapillaroscopy. Leucocyte subsets (CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells) were identified by surface markers, and phosphorylation was measured after cytokine or lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Medical records were reviewed 9-10 years later, comparing RP subjects who developed SSc (SSc<sup>+</sup>, n = 8) with those who did not (SSc<sup>-</sup>, n = 17) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 8). SSc<sup>+</sup> patients had significantly higher constitutive pSmad2/3 levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than SSc<sup>-</sup> or HCs (p = 0.005 and p = 0.034). SSc<sup>+</sup> and SSc<sup>-</sup> had higher stimulated pSTAT3(pY705) levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than HCs (p = 0.001 and p = 0.026). SSc<sup>+</sup> had higher stimulated pSTAT6 levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with HCs (p = 0.017) and in CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells compared with SSc<sup>-</sup> and HCs (p = 0.006 and p < 0.001). SSc<sup>+</sup> had higher stimulated pSTAT4 levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with SSc<sup>-</sup> and HCs (p = 0.004 and p = 0.037) and in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with SSc<sup>-</sup> (p = 0.007). No significant differences were found in pNF-κB and pSTAT3(pS727) levels. The results give insights into the pathogenesis of SSc. Smad2/3, STAT3(pY705), STAT6, and STAT4 pathways may serve as novel SSc biomarkers.

[PMID: 41186243] Elevated immunoglobulin (Ig) E has been frequently observed in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (eCRSwNP). However, the relationship between IgE levels and immune microenvironment remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the transcriptomic and immunologic profiles associated with different IgE levels in eCRSwNP, and to explore their potential clinical and biological significance. We enrolled 30 patients with eCRSwNP and stratified them into IgE-high (tissue total IgE ≥ 34.55 kU/L and serum total IgE ≥ 100 kU/L, n = 18) and IgE-low (below both thresholds, n = 12) groups. Healthy nasal mucosa from 10 control subjects was included. Bulk RNA sequencing, gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathway analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed to characterize IgE-associated transcriptional and protein expression profiles in nasal polyp tissues. Compared with controls, IgE-high patients exhibited higher tissue-specific IgE levels against aeroallergens, more severe clinical manifestations, and greater asthma comorbidity. Transcriptomic profiling revealed distinct gene expression patterns between eCRSwNP and healthy mucosa, with enrichment of T2 inflammation markers (CCL13, POSTN, IL5, IGHG4, and IGHE). IgE-high polyps demonstrated mucus hypersecretion and increased antimicrobial peptide expression (ITLN1, LTF, LYZ), alongside downregulated ciliary function-related genes. Immunohistochemistry validated increased IgE, IgG4, CD79a⁺ B cells and reduced FOXJ1⁺ ciliated cells in IgE-high tissues, consistent with the transcriptomic findings. Tissue IgE levels delineate clinically and transcriptionally distinct eCRSwNP endotypes. IgE-high nasal polyps demonstrated epithelial barrier dysfunction, mucus overproduction, and antimicrobial peptide activation, highlighting the potential of IgE-based stratification to guide personalized treatment strategies in eCRSwNP.

[PMID: 41186003] Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become a pivotal platform for mRNA drug delivery, yet the immunogenicity of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipids compromises efficacy upon repeated administration, making it necessary to develop PEG-free LNP formulations. Carbohydrates share the highly hydrophilic properties of PEG, making them good alternatives. Here we report a chemically driven strategy to replace PEG lipids with rationally designed glycolipids synthesized via a one-pot Borch reductive amination reaction. This method enabled conjugation of maltoheptaose (G7) to alkyl diamines, forming glycolipids that self-assemble into stable LNPs. Structural optimization revealed that G7-based glycolipids with C14 tails (G7B2) exhibited favorable physicochemical properties. Crucially, in vivo studies revealed that G7B2 LNPs significantly enhanced splenic accumulation, while minimizing anti-PEG antibody production. Furthermore, G7B2 LNPs maintained a consistent delivery efficiency over repeated administrations, a notable advantage over conventional PEGylated LNPs. As a proof of concept, G7B2-OVA mRNA achieved robust antitumor efficacy in a B16F10-OVA melanoma model. These results establish glycolipids as chemically tunable and immunogenically inert alternatives to the PEG lipids, offering a promising strategy for next-generation LNP formulations.

[PMID: 41185844] Background Lipedema is a chronic adipose tissue disorder affecting primarily women and is increasingly associated with immune dysregulation and intestinal permeability. Food-specific IgG testing has been explored in various inflammatory conditions, but its relevance to lipedema remains unknown. Objective The objective of this study is to characterize IgG food sensitivity profiles in women with lipedema and investigate the paradoxical relationship between increased food reactivity and reduced total IgG antibody levels. Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 234 participants: women with lipedema (n=80), women without lipedema (n=74), and men (n=80). All had undergone IgG testing against 222 food antigens via ELISA. We analyzed qualitative (positive/negative) and quantitative IgG reactivity, applied dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) and clustering, and developed a multivariable logistic regression model to assess diagnostic performance. Results Women with lipedema exhibited a non-significantly higher number of positive IgG food reactions (14.8 vs 12.6; <i>p</i>=0.186), despite significantly lower total IgG levels (1747.1 vs 2974.8 AU; <i>p</i><0.001). This paradox was consistent across 79.7% of tested antigens. The most discriminative foods included wild game meats and certain vegetables. A combined IgG-based model achieved an area under the curve of 0.804, outperforming individual IgG metrics. Dimensionality reduction revealed no clear clustering based on reactivity patterns alone. Conclusion Lipedema displays a paradoxical IgG signature, more frequent positives despite lower total IgG, consistent with mucosal immune dysregulation (e.g., increased intestinal permeability, immune exhaustion, or dietary monotony). Single IgG metrics had limited discrimination, but a combined score improved classification, supporting IgG profiling as a complementary, not standalone, biomarker for patient stratification and personalized dietary guidance. Collectively, these findings suggest that the adipose phenotype may be downstream of broader systemic processes; prospective studies should assess IgG subclasses, barrier markers (e.g., zonulin), and gluten-modulated interventions.

[PMID: 41185559] Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically aggressive hematologic malignancy characterized by high relapse rates and treatment resistance, highlighting the need for novel biomarkers to improve clinical outcomes. In this study, we explore the roles of nuclear receptor-interacting protein 1 (NRIP1) in AML, focusing on its associations with tumor progression and immune infiltration. Analysis of public AML gene expression datasets reveals that NRIP1 expression is significantly increased in AML patients. Those with high NRIP1 expression have markedly shorter overall survival than those with low expression. Furthermore, NRIP1 expression is significantly associated with the infiltration of diverse immune cells, including B cells, dendritic cells, T cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and T helper cells, suggesting that NRIP1 may be a regulator of immune cell infiltration. Functional enrichment analysis indicates that NRIP1 and its interacting partners are involved in tumorigenesis, immune microenvironment remodeling, and metabolic reprogramming. Survival analysis confirms the prognostic value of NRIP1. Importantly, functional validation in AML cell lines confirms that <i>NRIP1</i> knockdown suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis. Our study identifies NRIP1 as a multifaceted regulator that promotes AML by driving tumor progression, regulating immune cell infiltration, and modulating ferroptosis, highlighting its role as a novel prognostic biomarker.

[PMID: 41184864] Chemokines and their receptors play a pivotal role in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) and modulating immune responses by orchestrating immune cell recruitment, spatial positioning, and facilitating cell-cell interactions. However, the exact mechanisms underlying chemokine signaling across different cell populations within the TME remain poorly understood. In this study, we utilized multiple-omics approaches to explore the relationship between CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, CD8<sup>+</sup> exhausted T (Tex) cells, and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy response, as well as the role of chemokine signaling in the formation of CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophage and CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cell niches. We found that CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages were closely associated with ICB outcomes in melanoma. Additionally, combination therapy with a CCR1 antagonist and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced tumor burden in melanoma mouse models, which was attributed to the substantial depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cells. Further, CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages were found to co-localize with CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cells in human melanoma tissue, and the CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophage-CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cell niche was correlated with ICB treatment response in mice. Importantly, the CCR1-CCL3 axis was identified as a critical mediator in the formation of this niche. Overall, our study underscores the spatial relationship between CCR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex cells in ICB therapy, providing a promising strategy to overcome ICB resistance in melanoma.

[PMID: 41184006] <b>Objective:</b> To explore the effect of hairy and enhancer of split related protein 2 (Hey2) on osteoclast differentiation through the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). <b>Methods:</b> RAW264.7 cells were induced with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) to differentiate into osteoclasts. Experimental groups were divided by different concentrations of RANKL (0, 10, 20, 50 μg/L) and different processing time (0, 3, 5, 7 days). Hey2 overexpression experiment was grouped as follows: blank control group, RANKL group, empty plasmid vector control group (Hey2-NC+RANKL), Hey2 overexpression group (Hey2-OE+RANKL); similarly, groups in Hey2 knockdown experiment were as follows: blank control group, RANKL group, negative control group (si-NC+RANKL), Hey2 knockdown group (si-Hey2+RANKL). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment groups were divided as non-specific IgG control group (IgG control group), non-specific IgG+RANKL group (IgG RANKL group), Hey2-specific antibody control group (anti-Hey2 control group), Hey2-specific antibody+RANKL group (anti-Hey2-RANKL group). For the different RANKL concentration groups and different induction time groups, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA expressions of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), cathepsin K (CTSK), and cellular feline osteosarcoma oncogene (c-Fos) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to assess the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts. After Hey2 overexpression or knockdown, RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to detect the gene and protein expressions of NFATc1, c-Fos, and CTSK. TRAP staining was used to evaluate the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts. Bioinformatics prediction (NCBI, JASPAR) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were used to validate the binding of Hey2 to the NFATc1 promoter region. <b>Results:</b> During the osteoclastic differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells induced by RANKL, the expression of Hey2 could be detected, and the expression level of Hey2 decreased with the increase of RANKL concentration and induction time. In the 50 μg/L RANKL group, the expression levels of Hey2 gene (0.18±0.00) and protein (0.22±0.02) were significantly lower than those in the control group (1.00±0.00, 0.52±0.01) (<i>t=</i>41.67, 12.88; both <i>P<</i>0.001). In the 50 μg/L RANKL group inducted for 5 days, the expression levels of Hey2 gene (0.27±0.02) and protein (0.79±0.01) were significantly lower than those in the control group (1.00±0.00, 1.15±0.02) (<i>t=</i>11.47, 108.60; both <i>P<</i>0.001). Hey2 overexpression significantly reduced the gene and protein expressions of NFATc1, c-Fos, and CTSK, as well as the production of TRAP-positive cells (all <i>P<</i>0.05). Hey2 knockdown significantly increased the gene and protein expressions of NFATc1, c-Fos, and CTSK, as well as the production of TRAP-positive cells (all <i>P<</i>0.05). After inducing RAW264.7 cells with 50 μg/L RANKL for 1 day, ChIP results showed that among the two sample groups treated with Hey2 antibody, the detection level of the NFATc1 promoter region (-400 to-200 bp) in the anti-Hey2-RANKL group (18.06±0.06) was significantly higher than that in the anti-Hey2 control group (13.37±0.36) (<i>t=</i>12.56, <i>P<</i>0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Hey2 can bind to the downstream target gene NFATc1 at-400 to -200 bp region of the promoter. As a transcriptional repressor, Hey2 inhibits osteoclast differentiation.",10

However, because of their degradable nature, these compounds must be coated in polymeric structures, such as chitosan (CS). Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are incorporated into CS to enhance its mechanical properties. This study investigated the effects of hydrogels prepared from CS/SWCNTs and linalool (CS/SWCNTs/Lin) on the treatment of infected wounds in a mouse model. The physicochemical properties of the prepared structures were examined, along with in vitro release, cytotoxicity, and antibacterial properties. Wound contraction, total bacterial count, histopathological parameters, and the expressions of BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2), Beclin-1, Caspase-3, c-Myc, Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), P53, superoxide dismutase (SOD), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and collagen type I (COL-1A), as well as serum concentrations of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were investigated. The physicochemical properties confirmed the successful synthesis of the structures, and CS/SWCNTs reduced the rapid release of linalool within the first 24 h. The results also confirmed the safety and antibacterial properties of the structures. The administration of hydrogels significantly reduced the total bacterial count and edema, accelerated the wound healing process, and increased the expression of Beclin-1, BCL-2, Caspase-3, c-Myc, GPx, SOD, P53, TGF-β, and collagen 1A, as well as the serum concentration of TAC compared to control groups. In summary, CS/SWCNTs/Lin hydrogels accelerated the wound healing process by influencing the expression of apoptotic molecules and antioxidant factors in an infected wound model in mice.

[PMID: 40889671] Phytochemical investigation of the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction from the 95 % ethanol extract of Cynanchum paniculatum (Bunge) Kitagawa roots and rhizomes led to the isolation of eight previously undescribed C<sub>21</sub> steroidal glycosides (1-8) designated cynapanosides H-O, alongside eighteen known analogues. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis using HRESIMS, 1D/2D NMR, and comparison with reported data. All isolated glycosides were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against HeLa and HepG2 cell lines. Among these, cynapanoside K (4) exhibited antiproliferative effects on HeLa cells by inducing apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle arrest. Mechanistic studies revealed that 4 downregulated Bcl-2, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 protein expression while activating Caspase-9, suggesting mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways contribute to its cytotoxic activity. This study expands the chemical diversity of bioactive C<sub>21</sub> steroidal glycosides and provides insights into their potential antitumor mechanisms.

[PMID: 40614544] Among female cancers, breast cancer is the most prevalent type with a high tendency for metastasis, which makes it compelling to develop new therapeutic modalities in the battle against this disease. For this purpose, a new series of theophylline-based derivatives was designed as dual STAT3/NF-B signaling pathway inhibitors. The most active three compounds (12a, 12b and 17b) exhibited potent inhibition of both STAT3 and NF-κB activation in 4 T1 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.22-8.21 μM. They also exerted considerable anticancer activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.53 to 7.68 μM in 4 T1, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. These compounds demonstrated their ability to inhibit breast cancer cell migration, and invasion in scratch and transwell assays, respectively. As a consequence of STAT3 inhibition, compound 12a was able to induce apoptosis via its effects on key apoptotic regulators; caspases-3,9, Bax and Bcl-2. Besides, western blotting of 12a-treated MDA-MB-231 cells confirmed decreased expression of STAT3, p-STAT3, Bcl-xl, c-Myc and NF-κB. Moreover, compound 12a reduced tumor volume in a comparable manner to 5FU in an Ehrlich solid carcinoma model. Docking of these compounds into the active sites of STAT3 and NF-κB revealed adequate binding patterns, providing further support for their effectiveness. Hence, these compounds proved to possess structural determinants that could be further tuned into more potent anticancer agents for breast cancer.

[PMID: 40468424] This study investigates the molecular mechanism of action of F4B1, a novel oleanolic acid derivative in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. F4B1 is a naturally occurring oleanolic acid derivative that was isolated and purified from the leaves of Sesbania grandiflora. Structural analyses were carried out using 1D and 2D NMR, FT-IR, and mass spectrometric analyses. MTT assay was employed to evaluate antiproliferative effects in A549 (a model for lung cancer), MCF-7 (a model for breast cancer), HEP-2 (a model for head and neck cancer) and in MRC-5 (human lung fibroblast cells). Fluorescence staining, scanning electron microscopy, and flow cytometry were employed to study apoptosis and cell cycle. Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence techniques were followed to study the mechanisms of cell death. Schrodinger software was employed for docking studies. While preliminary screening was conducted in multiple cell lines, A549 cells were chosen for further mechanistic exploration based on their higher sensitivity to F4B1 treatment. F4B1 blocks the proliferation and causes intrinsic mode of cell death in lung adenocarcinoma cells. In particular, the above anticancer effect was mediated through a mechanism that is associated with the inactivation of NF-kappa B signaling and suppression of cyclin D1 expression leading to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase. Our study confirms that F4B1 induces apoptosis, as confirmed through Annexin V staining results. It is intrinsic apoptosis, as evidenced by upregulation of pro-apoptotic markers (BAX), downregulation of anti-apoptotic markers (BCL-2), cytochrome C release, activation of caspase-9, and caspase-3. These results establish the involvement of the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway. The pathway also involved the suppression of the proto-oncogene c-Myc both at the transcriptional and translational levels. Docking studies show that F4B1 has a high affinity binding towards CXCR4 and SRC kinase. Our findings specifically contribute to understanding the mechanism of F4B1, the isolated molecule from S. grandiflora, as an anticancer drug candidate and will hopefully pave the way toward further studies.

[PMID: 40321606] Cancer is a prevalent global disease affecting ~20 million individuals, and this burden causes the death of ~9.7 million people in 2024. The prevalence rate is continuously increasing due to exposure to harmful environmental and occupational contaminants (toxins and chemicals), compromised immune response, genetic modifications, and poor lifestyle and dietary practices. The management of cancer is challenging and demands cost-effective and safe therapeutic strategies. This review accentuates the anticancer potential of anthocyanins and its associated underlying mechanism. Anthocyanins, the active components extracted from grapes, berries, black chokeberries, eggplants, black currants, sweet cherries, strawberries, black grapes, plums, and red onions, hold antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential. The bioavailability of anthocyanins is a crucial factor in imposing their anticancer effect, and this bioavailability can be improved by microbial phenolic catabolites, provision of α-casein, and nano delivery systems. Anthocyanins hinder cell migration, invasion, and proliferation by inducing apoptosis, suppressing cell cycle at G0/G1, S, or G2/M stages, and modulating signaling pathways such as apoptotic cascades, PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB. Moreover, anthocyanins downregulate oncogenes (<i>Bcl-2</i>, <i>MYC</i>, and <i>HER2</i>) and improve the activity of tumor suppressor genes (<i>TP53</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, and <i>RB1</i>). Anthocyanins, particularly cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside, suppress inflammation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6) in colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, it causes cell cycle inhibition and mitochondrial dysfunction in ovarian and cervical malignancies. Although pre-clinical studies have proved anticancer activities, further clinical trials are required to validate its therapeutic impact and standard dose regimens.

[PMID: 40160106] The traditional medicinal plant <i>Centella asiatica</i> is commonly used in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine due to its vast range of therapeutic properties. Previously, the ethanolic <i>C. asiatica</i> leaf extract was subjected to silica column fractionation, and the C3 fraction was obtained. We investigated the antioxidant and anti-proliferative effects of C3 in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. In HEK293 cells, C3 cytotoxicity was assessed (viability assay; 24 h; [0.2-3 mg/mL]), and a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) was determined. Malondialdehyde (MDA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (spectrophotometry), mitochondrial depolarization (<i>Δψ</i><sub>m</sub>), intracellular reactive oxygen species (flow cytometry), glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations, caspase activities, ATP levels (luminometry), and fragmentation of DNA (SCGE assay) were evaluated. Protein expressions were assessed by western blotting. Gene expressions were quantified by qPCR. Cell viability in HEK293 cells was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by C3. MDA, <i>Δψ</i><sub>m</sub>, LDH, caspase activities, and DNA fragmentation (<i>P</i> < .0004) were significantly increased by C3. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) protein expression, GSH, and GSSG concentrations were increased, whereas antioxidant (<i>Nrf-2</i>, <i>GPx</i>, <i>SOD,</i> and <i>CAT</i>) gene expression was significantly decreased by C3 (<i>P</i> < .001). C3 decreased both Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression (<i>P</i> < .03). Gene expression of <i>c-myc</i> was significantly increased, whereas <i>OGG-1</i> was significantly reduced by C3 (<i>P</i> < .05). C3 reduced antioxidant gene expression, increased antioxidant levels, and elevated anti-proliferative effects in HEK293 cells, suggesting that high concentrations of C3 are potentially toxic to kidney cells, thus rendering cause for concern with its human use.

[PMID: 40103544] Pre-clinical toxicological investigations are pivotal in the development of safer and more efficacious chemotherapeutic agents. Oleanolic acid (OA), a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid, has demonstrated anticancer potential but is often limited by the toxic side effects of its derivatives. In the current study, we carried out the facile synthesis of a modified OA analogue, OD2, and studied its cytotoxicity and efficacy analysis across several cell lines. Mechanistic toxicology was explored through fluorescence-based assays. Annexin-V/Propidium Iodide (A-V/PI) staining and TUNEL assays were used to confirm apoptosis. OD2 exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity, with a pronounced effect on A549 lung cancer cells compared to other cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines. Apoptosis was found to be the predominant mode of cell death, evidenced by Fluorescence imaging analysis of chromatin condensation and mitochondrial dysfunction. This was further validated by an increase in Annexin-V-positive and TUNEL-positive cells in treated groups. OD2 activated the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as evidenced by increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 protein abundance levels. While the current study showcases the therapeutic potential of the selective toxicological activity of OD2, future studies will focus on the deconvolution of its potential polypharmacological mode of action and decoding the basis of its selective action, so as to glean important lessons that can be applied in the development of chemotherapeutic agents with favorable toxicological profiles.

[PMID: 39714972] Breast cancer ranks as the second most widespread form of cancer globally. Currently, combination therapy is being actively employed in clinical practice to augment the efficiency of anticancer treatment. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of femtosecond laser-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizing two distinct photosensitizers (PSs), zinc phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (ZnPcS<sub>4</sub>) and α,β,χ,δ porphyrin-Tetrakis (1-methylpyridinium-4-yl) p-Toluenesulfonate porphyrin (TMPyP) in conjunction with doxorubicin chemotherapeutic agent, on mammary carcinomas experimentally induced in female mice using 7,12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene (DMBA). Our results showed the efficiency of the combined therapy for promoting tissue apoptosis and necrosis as evidenced by histopathological observations and the noticeable reduction of Bcl-2 and Ki-67 expression. Moreover, there was a reduction in serum levels of the carcinoma antigen CA15-3 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Co-treatment of doxorubicin with ZnPcS<sub>4</sub>-PDT or TMPyP-PDT or a combination of both resulted in a decrease in the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream oncogenes NRAS, NF-κB, mTERT, and c-Myc, and an increase in the expression of the caspase-3 apoptotic gene. These results validate the therapeutic potential of combining doxorubicin with PDT, highlighting the potential of this co-treatment strategy as a promising alternative for enhancing existing anticancer approaches.

[PMID: 39596160] In B-cell malignancies, the overexpression of MYC is associated with poor prognosis, but its mechanism underlying resistance to immunochemotherapy remains less clear. In further investigations of this issue, we show here that the pharmacological inhibition of MYC in various lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines, as well as patient-derived primary tumor cells, enhances their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity induced by conventional antibodies targeting CD20 (rituximab) and CD38 (daratumumab), as well as T cell-mediated cytotoxicity induced by the CD19-targeting bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab. This was associated with upregulation of the target antigen only for rituximab, suggesting additional escape mechanisms. To investigate these mechanisms, we targeted the <i>MYC</i> gene in OCI-LY18 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated <i>MYC</i> targeting not only upregulated CD20 but also triggered broader apoptotic pathways, upregulating pro-apoptotic PUMA and downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, XIAP, survivin and MCL-1, thereby rendering tumor cells more prone to apoptosis, a key tumor-lysis mechanism employed by T-cells and NK-cells. Moreover, MYC downregulation boosted T-cell activation and cytokine release in response to blinatumomab, revealing a MYC-mediated T-cell suppression mechanism. In conclusion, MYC overexpressing tumor cells mitigated the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies through several non-overlapping mechanisms. Given the challenges associated with direct MYC inhibition due to toxicity, successful modulation of MYC-mediated immune evasion mechanisms may improve the outcome of immunotherapeutic approaches in B-cell malignancies.

[PMID: 39530846] Melanoma is an aggressive skin malignancy with rapid metastasis and high morbidity. Gedunin (GN) is a tetranortriterpenoid belonging to the Meliaceae family, described for its anticancer, antiproliferative and apoptotic properties. In the present study, we investigated the effect of GN on A431 melanoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. The inflammatory proteins (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), cycloxygenase 2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukin 6 (IL-6)) apoptosis-related proteins, such as Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3, and alterations in the PI3K/JNK and p38 pathways in A431 cells after GN treatment were examined. The cytotoxicity assay and cell apoptosis of GN activity on A431 cells were assessed using MTT assay, acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB), DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), propidium iodide (PI), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analyses. The findings demonstrated that GN (10 and 15 μM/mL) inhibits the growth of melanoma cells, triggers apoptosis by enhancing Bax and caspase, and reduces Bcl-2, cyclin-D1, c-myc, and survivin in a concentration-reliant manner. Additionally, GN attenuated the protein expression of inflammatory proteins (TNF-α, NF-κB, COX-2, iNOS, and IL-6) and the cell proliferative PI3K/JNK/p38 signaling pathway. Due to the imbalance in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, apoptosis is promoted, and the caspase cascade and Cyt-c are activated. This led us to conclude that GN treatment inhibited Bcl-2, cyclin-D1, c-myc, and survivin activity through the TNF-α/NF-κB and PI3K/JNK/p38 signaling pathways, further preventing the proliferation and stimulation of apoptosis, which contributes to growth arrest in melanoma cells. Gedunin has been shown to promote melanoma cell death in vitro, suggesting that it could be used as a future treatment for malignant melanoma. Our findings suggested that GN might be applied as a preventative measure in the management of skin melanoma cells.",10

Genetic testing has identified numerous pathogenic and benign mutations in BRCA1, but also thousands of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) with unclear functional consequences. Accurate cancer risk prediction for carriers of these VUS requires functional assays to assess their pathogenicity. In this study, we analyzed 16 BRCA1 VUS detected at the Hereditary Cancer Genetic Counseling Laboratory in Salamanca, Spain, with the goal of providing additional data to guide their reclassification. Since homologous recombination (HR) is the primary tumor-suppressive function of BRCA1, we employed two complementary HR repair assays to evaluate HR efficiency. The first, an already established assay, uses a HeLa-DR cell line harboring an HR reporter cassette and involves silencing endogenous BRCA1 followed by complementation with the VUS under study. The second, developed in this work, is also based in complementation assays that restore the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene, and employs a breast cancer cell line with a similar HR reporter system (HCC1937-HR) that lacks BRCA1 expression, allowing direct complementation. Both assays consistently identified five VUS (p.V11G, p.H888Y, p.G1201S, p.Q1395R, and p.F1734L) as pathogenic due to significantly reduced HR efficiency, whereas the remaining 11 VUS were benign in terms of HR function. Notably, two pathogenic variants (p.H888Y, p.G1201S) were located outside the known functional domains of BRCA1. The five HR-deficient variants were further evaluated for their sensitivity to ionizing radiation, which confirmed the deleterious impact on DNA repair for variants p.V11G, p.H888Y, p.G1201S and p.F1734L. Sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib revealed hypersensitivity only in cells expressing p.V11G and p.F1734L, suggesting variant-specific mechanistic effects with potential therapeutic relevance. In conclusion, recombination-based functional assays complemented with sensitivity assays are effective tools for assessing the pathogenicity of BRCA1 VUS and can provide valuable information to support clinical decision-making. We propose that these assays can be completed within a timeframe compatible with clinical needs, offering critical insights for genetic counseling and personalized treatment strategies.

[PMID: 40419811] Tatars and Bashkirs are large and closely related ethnic communities that reside in the territory of the Russian Federation but have managed to preserve their national identity through the course of history. This study included 446 Tatars, 53 Bashkirs, and 26 women of mixed Tatar-Bashkir ethnicity. Germline DNA analysis was performed for 349 breast cancer (BC) patients with clinical features of hereditary disease (family history, or young onset (</= 50 years), or BC bilaterality, or triple-negative receptor status (lack of expression of ER, PgR, and HER2) and 176 subjects with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). BRCA1 pathogenic variants (PVs) were detected in 63 women; surprisingly, five Slavic founder alleles accounted for 30 (48%) of the BRCA1 PVs. The genuine Tatar BRCA1 allele, c.5161C > T, was observed in 11 subjects. Among 27 women with BRCA2 PVs, six and five women were carriers of the c.-39-1_-39del and c.468dup variants, respectively. The loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) test confirmed the pathogenic nature of the c.-39-1_-39del [rs758732038] allele, which is located in the 5'UTR of BRCA2. Analysis of other BC-associated genes revealed single instances of PVs affecting PALB2, TP53, ATM, RAD51, and RAD51D genes. Tatars and Bashkirs, which are ethnically and religiously separated from Russians, carry an unexpectedly high proportion of Slavic BRCA1/2 founder alleles. The identification of recurrent Tatar/Bashkir BRCA2 pathogenic 5'UTR variant c.-39-1_-39del calls for a systematic analysis of regulatory regions of cancer-predisposing genes in patients with missing heritability.

[PMID: 39847877] Germline pathogenic variants (gPVs) in the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) genes confer high-penetrance susceptibility to breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC). Although most female BRCA carriers develop only a single BRCA-associated tumor in their lifetime, a smaller subpopulation is diagnosed with multiple primary tumors (MPTs). The genetic factors influencing this risk remain unclear. Further, in patients with BRCA-mutated tumors, there appears to be a variability in the effectiveness of olaparib treatment. This real-world, multicenter, observational study aimed to determine whether the location of BRCA gPVs within functional domains (FDs) is associated with the development of MPTs and the magnitude of olaparib benefit. The study population comprised consecutive patients with OC who underwent hereditary cancer genetic testing between May 2015 and March 2023. MPT history was assessed based on mutated genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) and the location of the PVs within the FDs. Clinical outcomes of olaparib first-line maintenance therapy were evaluated according to BRCA1/2 FD location. The frequency of MPT history in the overall population was 13.3% (118/882), and 20.4% in the BRCA-mutated subpopulation (68/333; P < 0.001). We observed a significant association between the DNA-binding domain (DBD) FD of BRCA2 and MPT. Specifically, 55.6% of BRCA2-mutated patients with PVs in the DBD had a history of BC as a second tumor. At a median follow-up of 48.5 months (95% confidence interval 10-70 months), the 48-month progression-free survival rates were 100.0% for patients with PVs in DBD, 91.7% for those with PVs in other FDs, and 36.4% for those with PVs in the RAD51-binding domain (RAD51-BD) of BRCA2 (P = 0.01). Results in the BRCA1 cohort were not statistically significant. The results suggest that the location of PVs within BRCA FDs may influence the onset of multiple tumors and the benefit of olaparib in patients with BRCA-mutated OC. These findings could be relevant for cancer prevention efforts, particularly given the increasing number of cancer survivors. However, further understanding is needed before these results can inform clinical decisions.

[PMID: 39673470] Inherited mutations in the genes coding for the tumor suppressor proteins BRCA1 and PALB2 can lead to increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Upon DNA damage, these two proteins form a complex to promote double-stranded break repair via homologous recombination. Missense mutations in either BRCA1 or PALB2 that disrupt this important interaction result in loss of effective DNA damage repair and are associated with breast tumorigenesis. However, the overwhelming majority of missense mutations found in the binding domains of these two genes remain classified as variants of unknown significance. Here we report an in vitro assay for assessing the effect of variants of unknown significance on the heterodimerization of PALB2 and BRCA1 that recapitulates the effect of the known deleterious mutations. We apply the assay to several variants of unknown significance in BRCA1 which reveals other mutations in this region that also disrupt binding, including a mutation of a residue not predicted to directly interact with PALB2. Structural analysis indicates that all BRCA1 mutations to proline tested disrupt α-helix formation and therefore are not well tolerated even when located at positions outside of the PALB2-binding interface. This assay and the structural hypothesis described will be helpful for assessing risk for variants identified in the future in the BRCA1/PALB2 interaction domains.

[PMID: 39638432] Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) inhibitors have improved ovarian cancer treatment outcomes. However, clinical response remains heterogeneous. Existing biomarkers, mainly breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 and 2 (<i>BRCA1/2</i>), are suboptimal. New tools are needed to guide patient selection. In this study, [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorthanatrace ([<sup>18</sup>F]FTT), a PET radiotracer for imaging PARP1, was compared with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and tumor features commonly assessed in ovarian cancer. <b>Methods:</b> Subjects with epithelial ovarian cancer underwent both [<sup>18</sup>F]FTT and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET before new oncologic treatment. The SUV<sub>max</sub> of [<sup>18</sup>F]FTT and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG was compared between lesions. [<sup>18</sup>F]FTT SUV<sub>max</sub> was compared with tumor location, tumor grade, and germline or somatic <i>BRCA1/2</i> status. Linear mixed models were fitted to identify subject-level differences. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-five lesions were identified in 14 subjects. No correlation was found between [<sup>18</sup>F]FTT SUV<sub>max</sub> and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG SUV<sub>max</sub> per lesion, supporting distinct molecular targets. [<sup>18</sup>F]FTT uptake varied widely across lesions, with no significant differences between mean SUV<sub>max</sub> and tumor location, grade, or <i>BRCA1/2</i> status. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that [<sup>18</sup>F]FTT PET may provide unique information on ovarian cancer distinct from [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET and commonly assessed tumor features. Our results imply a wide range of PARP1 expression in the studied ovarian tumors not explained by [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET, location, grade, or mutational status.

[PMID: 39198848] Pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations contribute to hereditary breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Paradoxically, bi-allelic inactivation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 (bBRCA1/2) is embryonically lethal and decreases cellular proliferation. The compensatory mechanisms that facilitate oncogenesis in bBRCA1/2 tumors remain unclear. We identified recurrent genetic alterations enriched in human bBRCA1/2 tumors and experimentally validated if these improved proliferation in cellular models. We analyzed mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in bBRCA1/2 breast and ovarian cancer from the TCGA and ICGC. We used Fisher's exact test to identify CNAs enriched in bBRCA1/2 tumors compared to control tumors that lacked evidence of homologous recombination deficiency. Genes located in CNA regions enriched in bBRCA1/2 tumors were further screened by gene expression and their effects on proliferation in genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens. A set of candidate genes was functionally validated with in vitro clonogenic survival and functional assays to validate their influence on proliferation in the setting of bBRCA1/2 mutations. We found that bBRCA1/2 tumors harbor recurrent large-scale genomic deletions significantly more frequently than histologically matched controls (n = 238 cytobands in breast and ovarian cancers). Within the deleted regions, we identified 277 BRCA1-related genes and 218 BRCA2-related genes that had reduced expression and increased proliferation in bBRCA1/2 but not in wild-type cells in genome-wide CRISPR screens. In vitro validation of 20 candidate genes with clonogenic proliferation assays validated 9 genes, including RIC8A and ATMIN (ATM-Interacting protein). We identified loss of RIC8A, which occurs frequently in both bBRCA1/2 tumors and is synthetically viable with loss of both BRCA1 and BRCA2. Furthermore, we found that metastatic homologous recombination deficient cancers acquire loss-of-function mutations in RIC8A. Lastly, we identified that RIC8A does not rescue homologous recombination deficiency but may influence mitosis in bBRCA1/2 tumors, potentially leading to increased micronuclei formation. This study provides a means to solve the tumor suppressor paradox by identifying synthetic viability interactions and causal driver genes affected by large-scale CNAs in human cancers.

[PMID: 39163754] Providing women who have tested positive for a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA 2 relevant information can help them to make informed decisions about managing their cancer risk. However, there is a lack of targeted informational support for BRCA positive women specific to the Irish context. The objective of this study is to identify the information needs of women diagnosed with a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA 2 regarding cancer risk management and decision-making. This is a descriptive qualitative study. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling and included women with a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 without a history of breast or ovarian cancer. Two focus groups were held with women (n = 16) to enable them to generate ideas and understanding of their shared information needs. In addition, ten individual interviews were conducted to capture the additional perspectives of health care and relevant policy stakeholders. Interviews were analysed using inductive coding (Braun and Clarke, 2006), with NVivo software (Qsr international, 1999). Three main themes were identified, Cancer Risk Management, Receiving Information, and Implications to Health and Wellbeing. BRCA-positive women expressed a need for information about managing their cancer risk. They were particularly concerned with managing the impact of cancer risk-reducing interventions on their psychological and physical health, wellbeing, and family life. Many women felt they had to advocate for themselves to get treatment and receive information. Participants expressed a need for a comprehensive informational resource where all relevant information related to BRCA risk management could be accessed at a single location. This study suggests that women diagnosed with a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ireland need more accessible information about managing their cancer risk, and the impact of a BRCA diagnosis on their family, health and wellbeing. These results will be used to identify relevant content for developing an informational decision aid for Irish women.

[PMID: 38795508] The aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcome of asymptomatic BRCA1/2 germline pathogenic variant (GPV) carriers with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) in their risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) specimen. In a previously described cohort of asymptomatic BRCA1/2 GPV carriers derived from the Hereditary Breast and Ovarian cancer in the Netherlands (HEBON) study, women with HGSC at RRSO were identified. Main outcome was ten-year disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary outcomes were time to recurrence, ten-year disease-specific survival (DSS), ten-year overall survival (OS). Patient, disease and treatment characteristics associated with recurrence were described. The 28 included women with HGSC at RRSO were diagnosed at a median age of 55.3 years (range: 33.5-74.3). After staging, eighteen women had (FIGO) stage I, three stage II and five had stage III disease. Two women did not undergo surgical staging and were classified as unknown stage. After a median follow-up of 13.5 years (range: 9.1-24.7), six women with stage I (33%), one woman with stage II (33%), two women with stage III (40%) and none of the women with unknown stage developed a recurrence. Median time to recurrence was 6.9 years (range: 0.8-9.2 years). Ten-year DFS was 68%, ten-year DSS was 88% and ten-year OS was 82%. Most asymptomatic BRCA1/2 GPV carriers with HGSC at RRSO were diagnosed at an early stage. Nevertheless, after a median follow-up of 13.5 years, nine of the 28 women with HGSC at RRSO developed a recurrence after a median of 6.9 years.

[PMID: 38544832] <i>BRCA1/2</i> genes are part of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathways in charge of error-free double-strand break (DSB) repair. Loss-of-function mutations of <i>BRCA1/2</i> genes have been associated for a long time with breast and ovarian cancer hereditary syndrome. Recently, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have revolutionized the therapeutic landscape of <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutated tumors, especially of <i>BRCA1/2</i> high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), taking advantage of HR deficiency through the synthetic lethality concept. However, PARPi efficiency differs among patients, and most of them will develop resistance, particularly in the relapse setting. In the current proposal, we aim to review primary and secondary resistance to PARPi in HGSC owing to <i>BRCA1/2</i> alterations. Of note, as several mechanisms of primary or secondary resistance to PARPi have been described, <i>BRCA1/2</i> reversion mutations that restore HR pathways are by far the most reported. First, the type and location of the <i>BRCA1/2</i> primary mutation have been associated with PARPi and platinum-salt sensitivity and impact the probability of the occurrence and the type of secondary reversion mutation. Furthermore, the presence of multiple reversion mutations and the variation of allelic frequency under treatment underline the role of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in treatment resistance. Of note, circulating tumor DNA might help us to detect and characterize reversion mutations and ITH to finally refine the treatment strategy. Importantly, forthcoming therapeutic strategies, including combination with antiangiogenics or with targeted therapies, may help us delay and overcome PARPi resistance secondary to <i>BRCA1/2</i> reversion mutations. Also, progression despite PARPi therapy does not preclude PARPi rechallenge in selected patients.

[PMID: 38151326] Our understanding of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer has significantly improved over the past two decades. In addition to <i>BRCA1/2</i>, pathogenic variants in several other DNA-repair genes have been shown to increase the risks of breast and ovarian cancer. The magnitude of cancer risk is impacted not only by the gene involved, but also by family history of cancer, polygenic risk scores, and, in certain genes, pathogenic variant type or location. While estimates of breast and ovarian cancer risk associated with pathogenic variants are available, these are predominantly based on studies of high-risk populations with young age at diagnosis of cancer, multiple primary cancers, or family history of cancer. More recently, breast cancer risk for germline pathogenic variant carriers has been estimated from population-based studies. Here, we provide a review of the field of germline genetic testing and risk evaluation for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers in high-risk and population-based settings.",10
Bacterial meningitis can be diagnosed on the basis of positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures.,bacterial meningitis AND cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AND positive cultures AND diagnosis,"41128098,41081038,41001330,40854562,40776523,40757508,40754530,40712354,40699015,40622714","[PMID: 41128098] In 2023, an estimated 1.3 million children (aged 0-14 years) became ill with tuberculosis, and 166,000 children (aged 0-15 years) died from the disease. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) is a molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic test that detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2020 and last updated in 2022. Parts of the current update informed the 2024 WHO updated guidance for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra for detecting pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance in children (aged 0-9 years) with presumed tuberculosis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and three trial registers without language restrictions to 6 October 2023. For study design, we included cross-sectional and cohort studies and randomized trials that evaluated Xpert Ultra in HIV-positive and HIV-negative children aged birth to nine years. Regarding specimen type, we included studies evaluating sputum, gastric, stool, or nasopharyngeal specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis); cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis); and fine needle aspirate or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis). Reference standards for detection of tuberculosis were microbiological reference standard (MRS; including culture) or composite reference standard (CRS); for stool, we considered Xpert Ultra in sputum or gastric aspirates in addition to culture. Reference standards for detection of rifampicin resistance in sputum were phenotypic drug susceptibility testing or targeted or whole genome sequencing. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the tailored QUADAS-2 tool, judging risk of bias separately for each target condition and sample type. We conducted separate meta-analyses for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance. We used a bivariate model to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. This update included 23 studies (including 9 new studies since the previous review) that evaluated detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (21 studies, 9223 children), tuberculous meningitis (3 studies, 215 children), lymph node tuberculosis (2 studies, 58 children), and rifampicin resistance (3 studies, 130 children). Seventeen studies (74%) took place in countries with a high tuberculosis burden. Overall, risk of bias and applicability concerns were low. Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (microbiological reference standard) Sputum (11 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 75.3% (95% CI 68.9% to 80.8%; 345 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 95.9% (95% CI 92.3% to 97.9%; 2645 children; high-certainty evidence). Gastric aspirate (12 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 69.6% (95% CI 60.3% to 77.6%; 167 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 91.0% (95% CI 82.5% to 95.6%; 1792 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Stool (10 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 68.0% (95% CI 50.3% to 81.7%; 255 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 98.2% (95% CI 96.3% to 99.1%; 2630 children; high-certainty evidence). Nasopharyngeal aspirate (6 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 46.2% (95% CI 34.9% to 57.9%; 94 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 97.5% (95% CI 95.1% to 98.7%; 1259 children; high-certainty evidence). Xpert Ultra sensitivity was lower against CRS than against MRS for all specimen types, while the specificities were similar. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis Meta-analysis was not possible for lymph node tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis due to low study numbers. Interpretation of results For a population of 1000 children, where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis: In sputum: • 112 would be Xpert Ultra positive, of whom 75 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (true positives) and 37 would not (false positives). • 888 would be Xpert Ultra negative, of whom 863 would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (true negatives) and 25 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). In gastric aspirate: • 151 would be Xpert Ultra positive, of whom 70 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (true positives) and 81 would not (false positives). • 849 would be Xpert Ultra negative, of whom 819 would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (true negatives) and 30 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). In stool: • 85 would be Xpert Ultra positive, of whom 68 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (true positives) and 17 would not (false positives). • 915 would be Xpert Ultra negative, of whom 883 would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (true negatives) and 32 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). In nasopharyngeal aspirate: • 68 would be Xpert Ultra positive, of whom 46 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (true positives) and 22 would not (false positives). • 932 would be Xpert Ultra negative, of whom 878 would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (true negatives), and 54 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). Detection of rifampicin resistance Three studies with 76 children evaluated detection of rifampicin resistance (sputum only); two of these studies reported no cases and one reported rifampicin resistance in two children. Xpert Ultra sensitivity was moderate in sputum, gastric aspirate, and stool specimens. Nasopharyngeal aspirate had the lowest sensitivity. Xpert Ultra specificity was high against both MRS and CRS. We were unable to determine the accuracy of Xpert Ultra for detecting tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance due to a paucity of data. This update was funded through WHO. The protocol for this review was originally published through Cochrane in 2019. The protocol for this update was a generic protocol that consolidated previously published Cochrane protocols of Xpert Ultra for tuberculosis detection and can be accessed at https://osf.io/26wg7/.

[PMID: 41081038] Bacterial meningitis (BM) represents the most severe variant of meningitis, with a mortality rate that may reach up to 100% in the absence of appropriate treatment. The success of therapeutic interventions is depends upon prompt and precise diagnostic evaluations. However, there exists a significant deficiency in the literature regarding the diagnostic efficacy within the Ethiopian context. Consequently, this study aims to evaluate and compare the diagnostic precision of microbial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodologies in individuals with suspected meningitis in Northwest Ethiopia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were procured from 400 patients who were clinically suspected of having meningitis and were admitted to the University of Gondar Specialized Hospital (UoGSH), located in Northwest Ethiopia. Real-time PCR, microbial culture, Gram staining, and cell enumeration were conducted at both the UoGSH laboratory and the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Addis Ababa. Of the total patients enrolled in the study, 58% were male. Clinical manifestations such as fever, headache, and neck stiffness were reported in 94%, 90%, and 81% of the patients, respectively, whereas altered consciousness was recorded in 37% of the cohort. The real-time PCR methodology identified 38 patients (10%) as positive for meningitis, in contrast to microbial culture, which detected only 10 (3%) of these positive cases. The two diagnostic modalities exhibited a correlation coefficient of 0.4 (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The traditional microbiological culture technique, in conjunction with Gram staining, was found to have a limited sensitivity in identifying bacterial meningitis compared with the real-time PCR methodology. Consequently, the integration of molecular approaches with higher sensitivity, such as real-time PCR, facilitates prompt diagnosis and precise treatment, while simultaneously sustaining the overarching meningitis surveillance framework.

[PMID: 41001330] Miliary tuberculosis (TB), a severe form of TB caused by lymphohematogenous dissemination from a <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> focus, usually presents with systemic symptoms including fever and malaise. Here, we report the case of an 87-year-old woman treated with low-dose prednisolone and methotrexate for polymyalgia rheumatica, incidentally diagnosed with small miliary nodules in her lungs on chest computed tomography without any symptoms. Moreover, the patient reported being full of energy. The acid-fast bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction test from various sites, including the transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, were negative; however, the histology of the TBLB specimen revealed epithelioid granuloma without acid-fast bacteria. One and a half months later, she was admitted to our hospital with fever and somnolence. The cerebrospinal fluid culture test was positive for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</i> and the patient was diagnosed with miliary TB complicated by tuberculous meningitis. This report suggests that although systemic symptoms usually accompany miliary TB, patients can be asymptomatic, and careful follow-up is important when suspected.

[PMID: 40854562] To derive and internally validate a clinical prediction rule to identify febrile infants aged 61-90 days at low risk of invasive bacterial infections (IBIs). Using data from 17 Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry (PECARN) emergency departments, we included noncritically ill, previously healthy infants aged 61-90 days with temperatures greater than or equal to 38°C and urinalyses and blood cultures obtained between January 1, 2012, and April 30, 2024. Our outcome was IBI, defined as growth of pathogenic bacteria from blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture. Using recursive partitioning with 10-fold cross-validation, we derived and internally validated a prediction rule using age, temperature, urinalysis (negative/positive), and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) as candidate predictors. Limiting the analysis to infants with procalcitonin (PCT) and ANC results, we evaluated PCT as an additional predictor. Of 4952 infants included, 100 (2.0%) had IBIs, including 95 (1.9%) with bacteremia without meningitis and 5 (0.1%) with bacterial meningitis. The optimal prediction rule identified low-risk infants as those with negative urinalyses and highest temperatures less than or equal to 38.9°C, yielding a sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI, 77.6-92.1) and specificity of 58.9% (95% CI, 57.5-60.3). In the subset of 1207 infants with PCT and ANC measurements, including 27 (2.2%) with IBIs (2 [0.2%] with bacterial meningitis), we identified PCT of 0.24 ng/mL or less and ANC of 10 710 cells/mm3 or less as low-risk predictors. This PCT-based rule demonstrated sensitivity of 100.0% (95% CI, 87.2-100.0) and specificity of 65.8% (95% CI, 63.0-68.5). We derived 2 accurate clinical prediction rules to identify febrile infants aged 61-90 days at low risk of IBIs when urine and blood testing are obtained. Prospective validation is needed.

[PMID: 40776523] Treating neonatal sepsis in Nepal remains difficult given the high rates of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study is to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern of culture-proven infections in neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. This cross-sectional prospective observational study was performed at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Pokhara Academy of Health Sciences from 15th july 2022 to 15th july 2023. We included all neonates admitted with positive cultures grown from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, endotracheal tube, and pus. Demographic, clinical, and microbiologic data were collected from the medical record. We reviewed antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all isolates. There were 51 culture-positive infections among 1327 neonates admitted, among which 23 cases from blood culture, 2 cases from cerebrospinal fluid, 14 cases from endotracheal tube samples, and 12 cases from pus samples. Gram-negative infections were predominant amounting to 35 (68.6%) including Pseudomonas in 12 (23.5%), and Acinetobacter species in 9 (17.6%) cases. Gram-positive infections were seen in 14 (27.4%) in which Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 6 (11.8%) cases. Yeast cells other than Candida albicans accounted for two (5.4%). For all Gram-negative isolates, resistance to Third-generation cephalosporin and aminoglycosides was reported in 75.0% (12 of 16 isolates tested) and 87.0% (24/31), respectively. Fluoroquinolone resistance was seen in 61% (8/13), resistance to penicillin was 59.3% (10/19), and resistance to carbapenem was in 100.0% (7/7) cases. There were high rates of antimicrobial resistance even with the reserved drugs among gram-negative pathogens. This alarms for the need for rationale prescribing of antimicrobials.

[PMID: 40757508] Low-complexity automated nucleic acid amplification tests (LC-aNAATs) are molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic tests widely used for simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance in sputum. To extend our previous review on extrapulmonary tuberculosis, we performed this update to inform a WHO policy update. To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of LC-aNAATs for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and adolescents with presumptive extrapulmonary tuberculosis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, up to 11 October 2023, without language restriction. A WHO public call for data was made between 30th November 2023 and 15th February 2024 to identify unpublished studies. We included cross-sectional and cohort studies using non-respiratory specimens and eight forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis: tuberculous meningitis and pleural, lymph node, bone or joint, genitourinary, peritoneal, pericardial, and disseminated tuberculosis. Reference standards were culture and a study-defined composite reference standard (tuberculosis detection); and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing with or without genotypic drug susceptibility testing (rifampicin resistance detection). Index tests included Xpert Ultra, Truenat assays, STANDARD M10, and Iron qPCR. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. For tuberculosis detection, we performed separate analyses by specimen type and reference standard using the bivariate model to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Based on a pre-defined condition, based on sample sizes and type of technology for performing class-based analysis, data for Truenat MTB Plus were not included in the meta-analyses for LC-aNAATs. Hence, we present results for Xpert Ultra and Truenat MTB Plus separately. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We included 37 unique studies where 36 studies evaluated Xpert Ultra and three studies evaluated Truenat MTB plus. We found no eligible studies for the other index tests. Overall, the risk of bias was low for patient selection, index test, and flow and timing domains. For the reference standard, the risk of bias for included studies was low (75%) or unclear (25%). Applicability for the patient selection domain was unclear for most studies because we were unsure of the clinical settings, and the applicability concern was low for most studies for the reference standard domain. Cerebrospinal fluid Xpert Ultra (16 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) against a microbiological reference standard were 88.2% (83.7 to 91.6) (287 participants; high-certainty evidence) and 96.0% (86.8 to 98.9) (1397 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Truenat MTB Plus (2 studies) There were not enough data to meta-analyze, and we have provided descriptive results for Truenat MTB Plus. The sensitivities in these two studies ranged from 95% to 100% while the specificities ranged from 55% to 100% against a microbiological reference standard. The sensitivity was 78.7% (70 to 86) and the specificity was 100% (91 to 100) against a composite reference standard from a single study. Pleural fluid Xpert Ultra (13 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity against a microbiological reference standard were 74.0% (60.8 to 83.9; 264 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 88.1% (78.8 to 93.6; 777 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Truenat MTB Plus (1 study) The sensitivity was 100% (2.5 to 100) and specificity was 100% (95.3 to 100) against a microbiological reference standard. Lymph node aspirate Xpert Ultra (6 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) against a composite reference standard were 71.3% (64.3 to 77.4) (243 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and 97.4% (82.3 to 99.7) (218 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Truenat MTB Plus (1 study) The sensitivity and specificity were 77.1% (66 to 86) and 100% (88 to 100), respectively, against a microbiological reference standard. The sensitivity was 100% (81 to 100) and specificity was 56% (45 to 67) against a composite reference standard. Rifampicin resistance Xpert Ultra (13 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 100.0% (93.4 to 100.0; 54 participants; high-certainty evidence) and 99.4% (92.1 to 100.0; 392 participants; high-certainty evidence). LC-aNAATs are helpful in diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Sensitivity varies across different extrapulmonary specimens, while for most specimens specificity is high, the tests rarely yielding a positive result for people without tuberculosis. For tuberculous meningitis, Xpert Ultra had high sensitivity against culture. Xpert Ultra also had high sensitivity and specificity for rifampicin resistance. Future research should acknowledge the concern associated with culture as a reference standard in paucibacillary specimens and consider ways to address this limitation. Additionally, there is a critical need for robust evidence on other technologies within the LC-aNAAT class. Funded by the WHO Global Tuberculosis Program. This is an update to the published review ""Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF assays for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults"" via doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD012768.pub3.

[PMID: 40754530] Bacterial meningitis (BM) in neonates leads to high mortality rates and long-term complications. Current guidelines recommend repeat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations to assess treatment efficacy, but their clinical value remains controversial. This study aims to evaluate the clinical utility and prognostic value of repeat CSF parameters within 3-5 days following initial antimicrobial therapy in neonates with BM. A retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from January 2017 to December 2022 yielded 241 neonates of diagnosed with neonatal BM upon discharge in our neonatal intensive care unit. Of these, 85 met the stringent inclusion criteria for enrollment. Data on clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, cranial imaging results and other relevant information were collected. The criteria for an adequate response to the initial antimicrobial therapy, established for this study, included a 48-hour afebrile period, negative meningeal irritation signs, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of ≤ 20 mg/L, and a neutrophil count of ≤ 10,000/mm³. Short-term adverse outcomes were defined as the occurrence of complications during hospitalization or sequelae at discharge. In the analysis of 54 neonates demonstrating an adequate response to initial antimicrobial therapy, a comparison between 29 neonates with repeated CSF parameter measurements and 25 neonates without such measurements revealed no significant differences in antibiotic duration (p = 0.728), complications during hospitalization (p = 0.517), or sequelae at discharge (p = 1.000). A multiple logistic regression analysis of the group with repeated CSF measurements identified elevated CSF protein levels as the only potential risk factor for complications during hospitalization (p = 0.045; OR = 15.046; 95% CI: 1.062-213.089). However, none of the other repeated CSF measurements, such as total leukocyte count in CSF (CSF-TLC), the absolute neutrophil count to total leukocyte count ratio in CSF [CSF-Neutrophil (%)], and CSF glucose, were significant predictors of complications during hospitalizations (P > 0.05 for all). Furthermore, except for CSF-Neutrophil (%), the other repeated CSF measurements were significantly positively correlated with their initial CSF parameters (P < 0.05 for all). In the full cohort of 85 neonates, significant differences were observed between the 54 neonates with an adequate response and the 31 neonates with an inadequate response to therapy. Significant variables included admission weight (p = 0.047), peak blood CRP levels before antibiotic use (p < 0.001), initial CSF protein levels (p = 0.007) and blood culture results (p = 0.037). Both the risk of complications during hospitalization and sequelae at discharge were also significantly different (p < 0.001). In the cohort of 85 neonates, there were significant differences between the 52 neonates without short-term adverse outcomes and the 31 neonates with short-term adverse outcomes. The variables showing significant differences included the presence of neurological symptoms (p = 0.021), peak blood CRP levels before starting antibiotics (p = 0.022), initial CSF glucose levels (p = 0.023), initial CSF protein levels (p = 0.001), and an inadequate response to initial antibiotic therapy (p < 0.001). For neonates with BM who have shown an adequate response to initial antimicrobial therapy, conducting repeated CSF examinations within the first 3-5 days of treatment appears to have limited value, as it does not provide additional information that could help physicians shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy or reduce the risk of short-term adverse outcomes, such as risk of complications during hospitalizations or sequelae at discharge. In contrast, for the initial assessment of short-term prognosis in neonates newly diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, the clinical global impression (CGI) at admission, particularly factors such as neonatal weight, neurological symptoms, response to initial antimicrobial therapy, and early laboratory data-including peak blood CRP levels before antibiotic use, initial CSF glucose levels, initial CSF protein levels, and blood culture. results [In Table 4, a comparison between neonates with an adequate response to therapy and those without revealed a significant difference in blood culture results (p = 0.025)] -have shown stronger predictive capabilities and deserve greater attention.

[PMID: 40712354] To summarize the clinical features of group B streptococcus (GBS) meningitis in infants and identify the risk factors for poor prognosis. The clinical data of 52 infants with GBS meningitis treated at Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2012 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 48 infants (48/52, 92.3 %) presented with symptom onset at ≤90 days of age. Among 52 patients, the most prevalent clinical manifestations were fever (98.1 %), altered mental status (84.6 %) and decreased appetite (63.5 %). Subdural effusion (30/52, 57.7 %) was the most common neurological complication. One patient (1.9 %) died from cerebral herniation. Positive blood culture alone was observed in 41 cases (78.8 %), isolated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture positivity in 5 (9.6 %), and dual blood-CSF culture positivity in 6 (11.5 %). The median hospital stay was 33 days. The most frequently administered antibiotic regimens were vancomycin combined with carbapenems (18/52, 34.6 %) and vancomycin plus third-generation cephalosporins (15/52, 28.8 %). Univariate analysis indicated an association between glucocorticoid use and clinical outcomes; however, multivariate analysis yielded no statistically significant variables (P < 0.05). GBS meningitis is most common in infants below 3 months. Both clinical manifestations and ancillary tests may be nonspecific, and definitive diagnosis relies on etiological confirmation. The risk of neurological complications is high.

[PMID: 40699015] Considering the need for a rapid, sensitive, and specific test for the early diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in critical regions where lumbar puncture and culture are inaccessible, we analyzed the specificity of the Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) for cryptococcal antigen in 217 serum specimens. Group 1: 68 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-uninfected patients with paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, trichosporonosis, and tuberculosis; Group 2: 149 patients with HIV infection, including seven with histoplasmosis, and one with aspergillosis, and Group 3 with 24 proven cryptococcosis patients. Cross-reactivity of cryptococcal mannans and polysaccharides secreted by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Trichosporon spp. has been described in vitro. However, only a few cases of positive LFA tests in aspergillosis, trichosporonosis, candidemia, and bacterial infections sera have been reported. We observed false-positive LFA in 2/29 aspergillosis specimens but not in other mycoses or tuberculosis. Among 149 HIV-infected patients, three specimens tested positive, two had cytomegalovirus infections, one of whom also had toxoplasmosis and the other, Kaposi´s sarcoma; one patient had no opportunistic infections. We observed sensitivities of 0.933 (serum), 0.95 (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]), and 1.0 (serum or CSF) for LFA, and for all negative controls (N = 217, serum), a specificity of 0.977, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.938. The specificity and NPV were 0.964 and 0.791, respectively, for 55 patients with mycoses; and 0.98 and 0.912 for 149 HIV-infected patients. We confirmed LFA's high specificity and accuracy for the control groups. There were 6.89% of false-positive results for aspergillosis, and no false-positive results for paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, or other bacterial diseases.

[PMID: 40622714] Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in childhood. It remains unclear whether early-onset sepsis is associated with epilepsy and to what extent early-onset meningitis may contribute to its development. To study the association between early-onset neonatal infection and childhood epilepsy. Nationwide, population-based, register-based cohort study of all Danish live-born singletons with at least 35 completed gestational weeks at birth without major congenital anomalies in Denmark between 1997 and 2013 with follow-up until 2021 or age 18 years, whichever came first. Data were analyzed from February 2024 to January 2025. Early-onset infection was defined as an invasive bacterial infection during the first week of life. Diagnosed infection was defined by diagnostic codes of sepsis or meningitis, while culture-positive infection only included those with bacterial pathogens cultured from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Epilepsy was defined as a hospital diagnosis or at least 2 redeemed prescriptions of antiepileptic medication. The association between diagnosed sepsis and epilepsy was investigated with multivariable Cox regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs. Associations for the remaining definitions of infection were investigated using person-time incidence rate ratios (IRR). Among 981 869 children, the median (IQR) gestational age was 40 (39-41) weeks, 501 615 (51%) were male, 8154 (0.8%) were diagnosed with sepsis, and 152 (<0.1%) were diagnosed with meningitis. Of these, 257 children had culture-positive sepsis and 32 had culture-positive meningitis. The incidence rate of epilepsy was 1.6 per 1000 person-years for children with diagnosed sepsis compared with 0.9 per 1000 person-years for children without an infection, resulting in an adjusted HR of 1.85 (95% CI, 1.60-2.13). Culture-positive sepsis was also associated with an increased risk of epilepsy (IRR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.08-5.56), while the highest risks were observed in children with meningitis both diagnosed (IRR, 9.85; 95% CI, 5.52-16.27) and verified by culture (IRR, 16.04; 95% CI, 5.21-37.46). In this nationwide cohort study, early-onset neonatal sepsis was associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of childhood epilepsy. As expected, early-onset meningitis was associated with an even higher risk of epilepsy with an approximately 10-fold increase.",10

Excess adiposity promotes tumourigenesis through endocrine, inflammatory, and mechanical pathways, contributing to increased cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis, and worse oncological outcomes. For patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery, obesity adds significant technical complexity and elevates perioperative morbidity. While effective interventions such as bariatric surgery and GLP-1 receptor agonists now exist, their integration into cancer care remains limited. Emerging evidence suggests potential oncological benefit, but high-quality data on perioperative implementation and impact on treatment response are scarce. Randomised trials evaluating short-course pharmacological strategies during neoadjuvant pathways are urgently needed. In the interim, routine preoperative obesity screening and referral for structured weight loss should be embedded into multidisciplinary workflows. This perspective underscores the importance of recognising and addressing obesity not only as a comorbidity, but as a modifiable risk factor and therapeutic target across the cancer continuum.

[PMID: 40002265] <b>Introduction</b>: Obesity is a chronic disease associated with increased risk for several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The majority of CRC cases are associated with modifiable risk factors. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is a proven, durable, and successful intervention for obesity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of MBS on CRC risk through measures of association, such as relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR). <b>Methods</b>: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Embase was conducted to identify systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses examining the relationship between obesity treated with MBS and CRC incidence. The PICO framework guided inclusion criteria, and three independent reviewers screened articles using Rayyan software. Quality assessment was performed using AMSTAR2. <b>Results</b>: Of 1336 screened articles, 10 SR met inclusion criteria, encompassing 53,452,658 patients. Meta-analyses consistently showed a significant reduction in CRC risk following MBS in patients with severe obesity. Risk reductions were reported by Liu et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.32-0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.01), Chierici et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.28-0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.018), Wilson et al. (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.003), and Pararas et al. (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. For colon cancer, Liu and Chierici both reported an RR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.46-1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.2444) with significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 89%). A trend towards reduced rectal cancer risk (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.40-1.39, <i>p</i> = 0.3523) was noted but limited by fewer studies. Sex-specific analyses revealed protective effects in both sexes, with a more pronounced impact in females (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.37-0.79, <i>p</i> = 0.0014). <b>Conclusions</b>: This umbrella review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of MBS on CRC risk, highlighting a consistent protective association. The findings also indicate a potential risk reduction for both colon and rectal cancer, with a more pronounced effect observed among females compared to males. Given the profound implications of MBS on cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, further high-quality, long-term studies are essential to deepen our understanding and optimize its role in cancer prevention and patient care.

[PMID: 39621160] This article aims to review the recent literature assessing the relationship between obesity and colorectal carcinogenesis, the effect of obesity on the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), tools available to help augment the increased risk, and outcomes for patients who are affected by both obesity and colorectal cancer. The biochemical mechanisms contributing to CRC carcinogenesis are not well understood but are suspected to be related to adipose tissue leading to a pro-inflammatory state and changes in the gut microbiome. Individuals with obesity are at higher risk for CRC development, worse oncologic outcomes, and increased rates of post-operative complications. Bariatric surgery decreases CRC risk but results with GLP-1 agonists are heterogeneous. Prehabilitation is the only weight loss method that has been demonstrated to decrease risks of post-operative morbidity in this population. Obesity augments CRC risk and outcomes. There are persistent knowledge gaps in etiology and epidemiology for the increased CRC risk in obese patients and more research is required to identify the therapeutic advantage of weight loss on CRC risk.

[PMID: 39419860] Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction (POGD) is a common complication following colorectal surgery. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of POGD after minimally invasive surgery and to assess the relationship between robotic surgery, POGD, and their outcomes. Patients who had undergone minimally invasive colorectal surgery at our institution between July 2018 and November 2023 were retrospectively enrolled. POGD was diagnosed based on the presence of two or more intestinal symptoms within 72 h or more after surgery. Risk factors were identified through regression analyses, and the impact of POGD on outcomes was assessed using linear regression.The association between those factors was assessed using subgroup analysis and hierarchical regression. A total of 226 patients were included in the analysis, including 33 with POGD. POGD occurred in 14.6% of patients, with a lower incidence in robotic surgery (7.3%) than in laparoscopic surgery (19.8%). Multivariate analysis indicated that robotic surgery had a protective effect, while blood loss exceeding 50 ml was an independent risk factor for POGD. POGD was also correlated with longer length of stays and higher costs. The association between POGD, length of stay, and cost varied depending on the surgical platform. Robotic surgery exacerbated the effect of POGD on short-term outcomes, which aligned with the observed significant interaction effect. POGD remains a prevalent postoperative disease. Preventive strategies, including meticulous hemostasis techniques and robotic surgery, should be prioritized by healthcare professionals to reduce POGD risk, improve short-term outcomes, and preserve healthcare resources.

[PMID: 39136945] Bariatric surgery is associated with decreased risk of obesity-related cancer and cardiovascular disease but is typically reserved for patients younger than 60 years. Whether these associations hold for patients who undergo surgery at older ages is uncertain. To determine whether bariatric surgery is associated with a decreased risk of obesity-related cancer and cardiovascular disease in patients who underwent surgery at age 60 years or older. Population-based cohort study of patients from Denmark, Finland, and Sweden who underwent bariatric surgery at age 60 years or older without previous malignant neoplasm or cardiovascular disease between 1989 and 2019. Each patient who underwent surgery was exactly matched to 5 patients with nonoperative treatment for obesity of the same country, sex, and age at the date of surgery. Data were analyzed in December 2023. Receiving treatment for obesity, including bariatric surgery and nonoperative treatments. The main outcome was obesity-related cancer, defined as a composite outcome of breast, endometrial, esophageal, colorectal, and kidney cancer, identified from the national cancer registries. The secondary outcome was cardiovascular disease, defined as a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage, identified from the patient registries. Multivariable Cox regression provided hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs adjusted for diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease, and frailty. In total, 15 300 patients (median [IQR] age, 63 [61-65] years; 10 152 female patients [66.4%]) were included, of which 2550 (16.7%) had bariatric surgery at age 60 or older and 12 750 (83.3%) had nonoperative treatment. During a median (IQR) of 5.8 (2.8-8.5) person-years of follow-up, 658 (4.3%) developed obesity-related cancer and 1436 (9.4%) developed cardiovascular disease. The risk of obesity-related cancer (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64-1.03) and cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-1.01) were similar among who underwent surgery and those who did not. Gastric bypass (1930 patients) was associated with a decreased risk of obesity-related cancer (71 patients [3.7%]; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.97) and cardiovascular disease (159 patients [8.2%]; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99) compared with matched controls (9650 patients; obesity-related cancer: 442 patients [4.6%]; cardiovascular disease: 859 patients [8.9%]). This cohort study found that bariatric surgery in older patients is not associated with lower rates of obesity-related cancer and cardiovascular events, but there was evidence that gastric bypass may be associated with lower risk of both outcomes.

[PMID: 34275110] The impact of pre-bariatric surgery BMI on the incidence of colorectal adenomas in the post-operative period is unknown. Here we aim to evaluate the incidence of colorectal adenomas after bariatric surgery and to assess super morbid obesity (SMO) as a risk factor for post-operative colorectal adenomas. An inception cohort of 1639 patients that underwent bariatric surgery between 2011 and 2019 in a referral center was retrospectively analyzed. SMO was defined as BMI > 50.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the influence of pre-operative BMI on the primary outcome. A total 381 patients (23.2% of the cohort) underwent colonoscopy and included in the analysis. Mean age was 51.1 years (± 10.6) with mean BMI of 42.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (± 6.2), and 49 patients (12.9%) had SMO. Median time to colonoscopy was 3.5 years. One hundred nine patients (28.6%) had colorectal polyps, and 38/109 (34.8%) had advanced adenoma. Two patients had colorectal cancer (CRC). Pre-procedural SMO was associated with diagnosis of colorectal polyp (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.9, p < 0.001) and advanced adenomas (HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.0-8.9, p < 0.001) upon adjustment to previously reported risk factors of CRC. Pre-procedural SMO is associated with increased risk of colorectal adenomas after bariatric surgery compared to obese and morbidly obese individuals. Pre-operative BMI should be incorporated into post-operative screening plan in this population.

[PMID: 33835324] Incisional hernias (IH) following abdominal surgery persist as morbid, costly, and multi-disciplinary surgical challenges. Using longitudinal, multi-state, administrative claims data (HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID)); (HCUP State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases (SASD)), we aimed to characterize the epidemiology, outcomes, recurrence, and costs of IH. 529,108 patients undergoing abdominal surgery in 2010 across six specialties (colorectal, general/bariatric, hepatobiliary, obstetrics/gynecology, urology, and vascular) were identified within inpatient and ambulatory databases for Florida (FL), Iowa (IA), Nebraska (NE), New York (NY), and Utah (UT). IH repairs, complications, and expenditures were assessed through 2014. Predictive regression modeling was validated using a training set of 1000 bootstrapped repetitions. 16,169 (3.1%) patients developed hernias requiring repair (4.3-year mean follow-up), 3176 (20%) underwent recurrent repair, and 731 (23%) underwent re-recurrent repair. Patients with IH had increased readmissions (6.6 vs. 2.4), morbidity (39 vs. 8% surgical and 22 vs. 7% medical), and costs ($46,000 vs. $25,000) when compared to patients without IH (p < 0.001). IH expenditures totaled $875 million: initial ($687 million), recurrent ($155 million), and re-recurrent hernias ($33 million). IH predominated in colorectal (10%), hepatobiliary (8%), and vascular (5%) procedures. Of 31 significant independent IH risk factors (p < 0.001), obesity, age, smoking, open surgery, and prior surgery were pervasive across surgical specialties. IH represents an unremitting surgical epidemic associated with considerable morbidity, costs, and features consistent with a chronic disease state. We define critical pervasive risk factors (obesity, age, smoking open surgery, and prior surgery) independently associated with IH across surgical disciplines. With failed repairs, subsequent success becomes less likely, increasing morbidity and costs-underscoring the critical importance of optimal treatment and prevention.

[PMID: 33744305] Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity and increased risk of cancer. The impacts of bariatric surgery on cancer risk in NAFLD patients are unknown. We investigated the effect of bariatric surgery on cancer risk in patients with NAFLD and severe obesity using the MarketScan database. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 18 to 64 years old newly diagnosed NAFLD patients with severe obesity between 2007 and 2017. We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between bariatric surgery, modeled as a time-varying covariate, and the risks of any cancer and obesity-related cancer, while accounting for confounding using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). A total of 98,090 patients were included in the study, 33,435 (34.1%) received bariatric surgery. In those without surgery, 1898 incident cases of cancer occurred over 115,890.11 person-years of follow-up, compared with 925 cancer cases over 67,389.82 person-years among surgery patients (crude rate ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77- 0.91). The IPTW-adjusted risk of any cancer and obesity-related cancer was reduced by 18% (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.89) and 25% (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.56-0.75), respectively, in patients with versus without bariatric surgery. The adjusted risks of any cancer and obesity-related cancer were significantly lower in cirrhotic versus non-cirrhotic patients who underwent surgery. In cancer-specific models, bariatric surgery was associated with significant risk reductions for colorectal, pancreatic, endometrial, thyroid cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma, and multiple myeloma. Bariatric surgery was associated with significant reductions in the risks of any cancer and obesity-related cancer in NAFLD patients with severe obesity.

[PMID: 33246847] Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is an effective treatment for obesity, which improves cardiovascular health and reduces the risk of premature mortality. However, some reports have suggested that RYGB may predispose patients to adverse health outcomes, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer. The present prospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of RYGB surgery on cardiovascular risk factors and gastrointestinal inflammation in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). University hospital setting in Finland. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and 6 months after surgery from 30 individuals, of which 16 had T2D and 14 were nondiabetics. There were also single study visits for 6 healthy reference patients. Changes in cardiovascular risk factors, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides were investigated before and after surgery. Fecal samples were analyzed for calprotectin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae immunoglobulin A antibodies (ASCA), active lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity, and methylglyoxal-hydro-imidazolone (MG-H1) protein adducts formation. After RYGB, weight decreased on average -21.6% (-27.2 ± 7.8 kg), excess weight loss averaged 51%, and there were improvements in cardiovascular risk factors. Fecal calprotectin levels (P < .001), active LPS concentration (P < .002), ASCA (P < .02), and MG-H1 (P < .02) values increased significantly, whereas fecal SCFAs, especially acetate (P < .002) and butyrate (P < .03) levels, were significantly lowered. The intestinal homeostasis is altered after RYGB, with several fecal markers suggesting increased inflammation; however, clinical significance of the detected changes is currently uncertain. As chronic inflammation may predispose patients to adverse health effects, our findings may have relevance for the suggested association between RYGB and increased risks of incident IBD and colorectal cancer.

[PMID: 32156296] The epidemiology and the outcomes of acute appendicitis in elderly patients are very different from the younger population. Elderly patients with acute appendicitis showed higher mortality, higher perforation rate, lower diagnostic accuracy, longer delay from symptoms onset and admission, higher postoperative complication rate and higher risk of colonic and appendiceal cancer. The aim of the present work was to investigate age-related factors that could influence a different approach, compared to the 2016 WSES Jerusalem guidelines on general population, in terms of diagnosis and management of elderly patient with acute appendicitis. During the XXIX National Congress of the Italian Society of Surgical Pathophysiology (SIFIPAC) held in Cesena (Italy) in May 2019, in collaboration with the Italian Society of Geriatric Surgery (SICG), the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the Italian Society of Emergency Medicine (SIMEU), a panel of experts participated to a Consensus Conference where eight panelists presented a number of statements, which were developed for each of the four topics about diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis in elderly patients, formulated according to the GRADE system. The statements were then voted, eventually modified and finally approved by the participants to the Consensus Conference. The current paper is reporting the definitive guidelines statements on each of the following topics: diagnosis, non-operative management, operative management and antibiotic therapy.",10
Bariatric surgery increases rates of postmenopausal breast cancer.,Bariatric Surgery AND Postmenopausal Breast Cancer AND Risk Factors AND Outcomes,"28938270,20670865,41187384,41187382,41187376,41187374,41187368,41187363,41187362,41187360","[PMID: 28938270] To determine whether bariatric surgery is associated with a lower risk of cancer. Obesity is strongly associated with many types of cancer. Few studies have examined the relationship between bariatric surgery and cancer risk. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing bariatric surgery between 2005 and 2012 with follow-up through 2014 using data from a large integrated health insurance and care delivery systems with 5 study sites. The study included 22,198 subjects who had bariatric surgery and 66,427 nonsurgical subjects matched on sex, age, study site, body mass index, and Elixhauser comorbidity index. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were used to examine incident cancer up to 10 years after bariatric surgery compared to the matched nonsurgical patients. After a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, we identified 2543 incident cancers. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery had a 33% lower hazard of developing any cancer during follow-up [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60, 0.74, P < 0.001) compared with matched patients with severe obesity who did not undergo bariatric surgery, and results were even stronger when the outcome was restricted to obesity-associated cancers (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.51, 0.69, P < 0.001). Among the obesity-associated cancers, the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44, 0.77, P < 0.001), colon cancer (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36, 0.97, P = 0.04), endometrial cancer (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.67, P < 0.001), and pancreatic cancer (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22, 0.97, P = 0.04) was each statistically significantly lower among those who had undergone bariatric surgery compared with matched nonsurgical patients. In this large, multisite cohort of patients with severe obesity, bariatric surgery was associated with a lower risk of incident cancer, particularly obesity-associated cancers, such as postmenopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and colon cancer. More research is needed to clarify the specific mechanisms through which bariatric surgery lowers cancer risk.

[PMID: 20670865] Obesity is strongly associated with endometrial and breast cancers; further, obese women are less likely to undergo recommended cancer screening. The objective was to determine the preoperative practices of bariatric surgeons with regard to gynecologic assessment and cancer screening. A 28-question survey was mailed to 1,503 US bariatric surgeons to assess self-reported perceptions of gynecologic cancer screening, preoperative evaluation of female patients, and gynecologic oncology awareness and knowledge. Of 1,503 surgeons, 274 responded (18%) and 11 incomplete surveys were excluded, leaving 263 (17%) for analysis. Mean surgeon age was 46.8 years. Surgeons averaged 13.9 years postresidency and were predominantly male (89%). Eighty percent obtained gynecologic histories, but 56% and 49%, respectively, did not require Pap tests or mammograms before bariatric surgery. Only 21% had ever referred a patient for endometrial evaluation. Female surgeons were more likely to obtain menstrual and cancer-related family histories (p < 0.05). Surgeons who graduated from residency 10 or more years ago were more likely to obtain a pregnancy history (p = 0.006). One-fifth of surgeons reported that they do not consistently counsel their patients about increased cancer risks due to obesity. Last, surgeons correctly identified the following signs and risk factors of endometrial cancer at variable rates: postmenopausal bleeding (99%), obesity (97%), irregular or heavy periods (69%), hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (21%), infertility (20.2%), diabetes (14.1%), and hypertension (4.9%). Given the massive increases in morbid obesity and bariatric surgery in women, surgeons could serve a vital role in educating patients about both gynecologic and nongynecologic malignancy risks. With appropriate referral for cancer screening, patient outcomes could improve.

[PMID: 41187384] Treatment for gaming disorder (GD) can be challenging due to comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187376] There is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of current hospital-based follow-up after treatment for gynaecological cancers. Moreover, patients often report their aftercare needs are unmet. In an era of increasing pressure on healthcare resources - alongside a growing emphasis on patient-empowerment and appropriate care - it is time to reconsider current follow-up practices for gynaecological cancer survivors. This has led to a growing body of research exploring new approaches to follow-up care in gynaecologic oncology. In this scoping review, we aim to explore these alternative follow-up approaches and evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to current follow-up care. The methodological framework for scoping studies by Arksey and O'Malley's was used, further guided by the PRISMA-ScR checklist. A literature search on follow-up care for gynaecological cancers was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid) and Cochrane Library. Included studies employed a comparative method, allowing assessment of alternative approaches relative to current follow-up. Data were charted according to the TIDieR checklist and guide for better reporting of interventions. Eighteen articles were included, identifying three categories of alternative follow-up strategies: nurse-led follow-up, reduced follow-up and patient-initiated follow-up. Across all categories, these approaches showed similar - and sometimes improved - effect on oncological outcomes, quality of life, and/or patient satisfaction, without increased costs and healthcare use. Follow-up care can be delivered in alternative ways, without compromising on patient experiences or oncological safety. This offers the possibility of more cost-effective and resource-efficient healthcare. These findings support the feasibility of using alternative follow-up strategies in gynaecological oncological care.

[PMID: 41187374] The aim of this umbrella review was to synthesise existing evidence from systematic reviews on the impact of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on recovery in intensive care units. This umbrella review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidance, and its reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews statement. The search was carried out in the databases Medline®, CINAHL®, Scopus®, SciELO®, Web of Science®, Cochrane®, and SportDiscus®, using both indexed terms specific to each database and free-text terms. To assess the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews, the AMSTAR 2, tool was usedcovering 16 domains related to review design and reporting quality. The search was conducted with no temporal limits, until December 2024. A total of 21 systematic reviews were included. The most frequently assessed outcomes were muscle strength, muscle mass, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Muscle strength was the most extensively investigated outcome, with 11 reviews reporting positive effects. The analysis of primary study overlap revealed a moderate degree of overlap (6.71%). It is concluded that neuromuscular electrical stimulation is safe for critically ill patients, with positive effects on muscle strength, muscle mass, and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Although neuromuscular electrical stimulation demonstrates promising results in the rehabilitation of critically ill patients, the methodological quality of the available systematic reviews is variable. Therefore, there is a need for more robust and high-quality systematic reviews to strengthen the evidence base.

[PMID: 41187368] Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the standard drug for treatment of eclampsia, and to prevent its occurrence in women with preeclampsia with severe features, however, the ideal postpartum treatment duration remains unclear. To assess whether a 12-hour postpartum MgSO4 regimen is non-inferior to the standard 24-hour regimen. This was a single-center, randomized, non-blinded, non-inferiority clinical trial conducted at a tertiary hospital in Brazil. The intervention involved the use of MgSO4 for 12 h after childbirth, compared to the standard regimen of 24 h. Women were randomly assigned to each group. The primary outcome was a new use of MgSO4 due to recurrence of symptoms within the first 10 days of childbirth. Secondary outcomes included maternal complications, pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal outcomes. 79 women were included in this study (40 in the 12-hour group and 39 in the 24-hour group). The demographic characteristics of women in both groups were similar. The rate of use of MgSO4 in the postpartum was similar in both groups (4 vs 9, 10.0 % vs 23.1 %, p = 0.206). After enrolment, no cases of eclampsia occurred in the 12-hour group, and one occurred in the 24-hour group. No significant differences were found regarding birth weight, Apgar scores, or NICU admissions. A 12-hour magnesium sulfate regimen was non-inferior to the 24-hour standard, supporting its safety and potential utility in optimizing postpartum care, especially in resource-constrained settings.

[PMID: 41187363] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains a major respiratory pathogen of economic concern in the poultry industry. This study investigated the farm-level prevalence of IBV and evaluated associated risk factors in northern Vietnam by a cross-sectional study from June 2022 to June 2024. A total of 69 poultry farms were randomly selected across nine provinces, and pooled tracheal swab samples were purposively collected for IBV detection using RT-qPCR. The overall IBV farm-level prevalence was 34.78 % (95 % CI:23.71-47.21 %). Although no statistically significant differences were found across provinces, production types, age groups, or flock sizes, IBV was detected in all subgroups, indicating widespread circulation of the virus. A total of 22 potential risk factors were initially assessed using univariate logistic regression. Of these, six variables with P < 0.1, including farm size, number of poultry houses, presence of multiple age groups, vaccination at day-old, frequency of disinfection before chick placement, and proximity to live bird markets and residential areas, were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model retained two independent predictors: performing more than one disinfection before chick placement (P = 0.035), and administration of a live IB vaccine at one day of age (P = 0.006), both of which were significantly associated with reduced the odds of IBV infection at the farm level. These findings suggest that strategic vaccination and careful calibration of disinfection protocols are critical to minimizing IBV transmission at the farm level.

[PMID: 41187362] The risk of a foreign animal disease coming into the United States and threatening the swine industry necessitates the need for enhanced biosecurity plans to mitigate risks to premises. Although most biosecurity information is aimed and created for larger producers and isn't appropriate for smaller producers, such as swine exhibitors. Swine exhibitors are a niche group who raise swine differently than large producers and travel extensively with their animals. This study sought out to; develop a SPS plan template adapted from the SPS framework that would be suitable for swine exhibitors' biosecurity features; describe basic demographics and existence of biosecurity plan (and their features) for the target population; and investigate the association between having a previous biosecurity plan on site and demographic factors (number of pigs, type of housing, presence of other animal species in the premise and geographical region) as well as potential exposure to feral swine under their current housing conditions. These objectives were accomplished by attending twelve swine exhibitions within a year and a half to assist 161 individuals in the creation of personalized biosecurity plans for their premises, while obtaining additional study data. This study found no significant relationship between demographic factors and previously having a biosecurity plan, but that only 31.8 % of participants had previous biosecurity plans on their premise. However, swine exhibitors with existing biosecurity plans had more than 3-fold higher odds of acknowledging housing conditions with potential of feral swine contact compared to swine exhibitors without preexisting biosecurity plans. These findings indicate the need for additional efforts to assist swine exhibitors in creating biosecurity plans at shows across the United States.

[PMID: 41187360] In porous polyethylene (PPE)-based microtia reconstruction, achieving an esthetically contoured ear remains a surgical challenge owing to complex soft tissue placement and need for seamless skin coverage. Although autologous techniques have standardized incision patterns, no systematic approach exists for alloplastic procedures. We propose a subtype-specific skin incision algorithm for PPE-based microtia reconstruction to improve esthetic outcomes, standardize surgical planning, and evaluate clinical effectiveness. This analysis included 15 patients (16 ears) who underwent PPE-based auricular reconstruction between October 2023 and June 2024. Incision types were selected using a subtype-specific algorithm: midline incisions for grade 1-3 microtia and perimastoid incisions for grade 4 and bilateral cases. Adult and pediatric patients were assessed preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) and Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory (GCBI), respectively. All patients were evaluated using the Auricular Reconstruction Evaluation Scale at 6 months. Among the 16 reconstructed ears, 9 and 7 underwent midline and perimastoid incisions, respectively. GBI and GCBI scores improved significantly postoperatively (p = 0.041 and p = 0.002, respectively). Preoperatively, GCBI scores were significantly lower than GBI scores (p = 0.002). The median evaluation scores included overall appearance (4.29 [IQR 4.17-4.43]), esthetic subunits (4.00 [IQR 3.95-4.20]), donor-site outcome (4.40 [IQR 4.20-4.60]), and psychosocial satisfaction (4.80 [IQR 4.70-4.90]). The proposed incision algorithm improves esthetic and psychosocial outcomes in PPE-based microtia reconstruction by reducing the need for skin grafts and preserving postauricular sulcus depth, thereby offering a practical and reproducible strategy for surgical planning.

Bariatric surgery leads to positive outcomes in mental health.,bariatric surgery AND mental health outcomes AND mental health benefits AND psychological well-being,"40686538,40228835,39598241,39519418,38578667,38302857,38237524,38345771,33233694,32477191","[PMID: 40686538] Obesity is a significant global health issue, leading to various physical and psychological complications. Bariatric surgery is considered to be an efficient treatment for obesity, contributing to weight loss and metabolic improvements. While the physical benefits of bariatric procedures are well documented, the psychological effects, particularly gender differences in quality of life and depression post-surgery, remain an area of interest in the Indian context. The study aims to examine the gender changes in QoL and depression among individuals experienced the Surgery BS. It focuses on three surgical procedures: Roux-en-Y gastric Bypass (RYGB), One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The study hypothesised that gender differences exist in post-surgical QoL outcomes and depression levels. A quantitative, cross-sectional research design is employed to assess the gender differences among 200 post-bariatric surgery patients (100 males, 100 females) who had undergone surgery between 3 and 6 months. The equipment that is utilised is the WHOQoL-BREF and even the BDI-II. Hence, the ANOVA and <i>t</i>-tests are even conducted to examine the differences in gender and variations across the process of surgeries. The results outlined that there is no significant difference in depression and Qol among the patients of post-bariatric surgery. The findings even demonstrated that no differences in QoL scores among distinct processes of surgeries among both genders. However, the core trend in depression stages is observed in males based on their surgery type, recommending the possible changes in the outcomes across distinct processes. The results identified no gender-based disparities in QoL and depression following surgery. While RYGB showed slightly higher QoL scores in males while SG exhibited greater levels of depression, these distinctions were not significant. The findings outline the significance of post-operative support for individuals, regardless of type, to enhance mental well-being and QoL.

[PMID: 40228835] Obesity is a complex, chronic, stigmatized disease whereby abnormal or excess body fat may impair health or increase the risk of medical complications, and can reduce quality of life and shorten lifespan in children and families. We developed this guideline to provide evidence-based recommendations on options for managing pediatric obesity that support shared decision-making among children living with obesity, their families, and their health care providers. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We used the Guidelines International Network principles to manage competing interests. Caregivers, health care providers, and people living with obesity participated throughout the guideline development process, which optimized relevance. We surveyed end users (caregivers, health care providers) to prioritize health outcomes, completed 3 scoping reviews (2 on minimal important difference estimates; 1 on clinical assessment), performed 1 systematic review to characterize families' values and preferences, and conducted 3 systematic reviews and meta-analyses to examine the benefits and harms of behavioural and psychological, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions for managing obesity in children. Guideline panellists developed recommendations focused on an individualized approach to care by using the GRADE evidence-to-decision framework, incorporating values and preferences of children living with obesity and their caregivers. Our guideline includes 10 recommendations and 9 good practice statements for managing obesity in children. Managing pediatric obesity should be guided by a comprehensive child and family assessment based on our good practice statements. Behavioural and psychological interventions, particularly multicomponent interventions (strong recommendation, very low to moderate certainty), should form the foundation of care, with tailored therapy and support using shared decision-making based on the potential benefits, harms, certainty of evidence, and values and preferences of children and families. Pharmacologic and surgical interventions should be considered (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty) as therapeutic options based on availability, feasibility, and acceptability, and guided by shared decision-making between health care providers and families. This guideline will support children, families, and health care providers to have informed discussions about the balance of benefits and harms for available obesity management interventions to support value- and preference-sensitive decision-making.

[PMID: 39598241] The demand for body sculpting procedures after massive weight loss (MWL) has grown, with medial thighplasty (MT) emerging as an effective option. This study examines the impact of MT on quality of life (QoL), particularly focusing on body image and self-perception in individuals who have undergone MWL. This retrospective, single-center study included 21 patients who had post-bariatric MWL and subsequently underwent MT. QoL, with a focus on body image and self-perception, and was assessed through a custom-designed questionnaire administered before and after surgery. Inclusion criteria were a BMI < 35 and a history of bariatric surgery. Twenty-one patients (20 female, 1 male) were included, with an average age of 50.3 years. The median weight loss was 58.4 kg. Post-operatively, the Physical Component Score (PCS-12) showed significant improvement, while the Mental Component Score (MCS-12) did not show a notable change. However, self-acceptance, body contact, sexuality, and self-esteem all significantly improved post-surgery, whereas vitality did not. Consistent with previous studies, MT yields positive outcomes regarding physical well-being. This study further highlights the procedure's benefits for self-acceptance, body contact, sexuality, and self-esteem. Patients with expectations of improvements in vitality, or mental health concerns like depression or anxiety, should be carefully selected and may benefit from multidisciplinary care, including psychiatry or psychological support, to avoid dissatisfaction with post-surgical outcomes.

[PMID: 39519418] Obesity management strategies such as caloric restriction, very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs), and meal replacements can lead to moderate short-term weight loss. However, many patients face significant challenges in maintaining these results. Personalized interventions, including behavioral counseling and physical activity, have been shown to improve long-term adherence and success. Current clinical guidelines emphasize the pivotal role of dietitians in enhancing patient outcomes through nutritional therapy. When combined with pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery, the focus shifts from mere weight loss to broader health improvements. This review explores the evolving role of dietitians in obesity management, advocating for a shift from a weight-centric approach to a more holistic model that prioritizes overall health gains. Key areas of interest include dietetic interventions' impact on metabolic health, cardiovascular function, gut microbiome balance, inflammation, and psychological well-being. Dietetic interventions have been shown to provide significant health improvements beyond weight loss. These include enhanced metabolic and cardiovascular health, better gut microbiome balance, reduced inflammation, improved sleep quality, mental well-being, and overall quality of life. By focusing on non-scale victories such as improved insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, and mental health, dietitians play a crucial role in driving long-term success in obesity management. These outcomes highlight the need to shift the focus from short-term weight loss to a more comprehensive view of health gains. The role of dietitians in obesity management is expanding to encompass a more comprehensive and individualized approach. Moving beyond a focus on weight reduction, this paradigm promotes long-term, patient-centered strategies that address the multifactorial nature of obesity. By combining dietary changes with regular physical activity and behavioral support, dietitians can contribute to sustained health improvements, treating obesity as a chronic, complex disease.

[PMID: 38578667] Virtual reality (VR) interventions, based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles, have been proven effective as complementary tools in managing obesity and have been associated with promoting healthy behaviors and addressing body image concerns. However, they have not fully addressed certain underlying causes of obesity, such as a lack of motivation to change, low self-efficacy, and the impact of weight stigma interiorization, which often impede treatment adherence and long-term lifestyle habit changes. To tackle these concerns, this study introduces the VR self-counseling paradigm, which incorporates embodiment and body-swapping techniques, along with motivational strategies, to help people living with obesity effectively address some of the root causes of their condition. This study aims to assess the clinical efficacy of ConVRself (Virtual Reality self-talk), a VR platform that allows participants to engage in motivational self-conversations. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 68 participants from the bariatric surgery waiting list from the obesity unit of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Participants were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: a control group (CG), which only received treatment as usual from the obesity unit; experimental group 1 (EG1), which, after intensive motivational interviewing training, engaged in 4 sessions of VR-based self-conversations with ConVRself, and underwent embodiment and body-swapping techniques; and experimental group 2 (EG2), which engaged in 4 VR-based sessions led by a virtual counselor with a prerecorded discourse, and only underwent the embodiment technique. In the case of both EG1 and EG2, the VR interventions were assisted by a clinical researcher. Readiness to change habits, eating habits, and psychological variables, as well as adherence and satisfaction with ConVRself were measured at baseline, after the intervention, 1 week after the intervention, and 4 weeks after the intervention. Regarding the primary outcomes, EG1 (24/68, 35%) and EG2 (22/68, 32%) showed significant improvements in confidence to lose weight compared to the CG (22/68, 32%) at all assessment points (β=-.16; P=.02). Similarly, EG1 demonstrated a significant increase after the intervention in readiness to exercise more compared to the CG (β=-.17; P=.03). Regarding the secondary outcomes, EG1 participants showed a significant reduction in uncontrolled eating (β=.71; P=.01) and emotional eating (β=.29; P=.03) compared to the CG participants, as well as in their anxiety levels compared to EG2 and CG participants (β=.65; P=.01). In addition, participants from the experimental groups reported high adherence and satisfaction with the VR platform (EG1: mean 59.82, SD 4.00; EG2: mean 58.43, SD 5.22; d=0.30, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.89). This study revealed that using VR self-conversations, based on motivational interviewing principles, may have benefits in helping people with obesity to enhance their readiness to change habits and self-efficacy, as well as reduce dysfunctional eating behaviors and anxiety.

[PMID: 38302857] The health benefits of bariatric surgery are well documented; however, the occurrence of weight-regain after surgery, along with the development of mental health difficulties poses a question of how contemporary psychology could assist to prepare people living with obesity prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. This research explored individuals' (in the immediate pre-operative and post-operative population) attitudes, beliefs and experiences towards obesity and their journey to bariatric surgery. Seventeen adult participants (males n = 4; age range: 26-64 years) were recruited and participated in a semi-structured interview. Twelve individuals participated prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. Five individuals participated in the early post-operative period (<3 months post-surgery). People living with obesity displayed high optimism for positive outcomes, with participants hoping that bariatric surgery would be different to previous attempts at weight regulation, with there being a clear shift in the locus of control for weight management from self to healthcare professionals. Whilst this is adaptive, there was the presence of seemingly unrealistic optimism, with many pre-surgery participants not relaying the realistic possibility of post-surgery weight-regain. Despite the optimism individuals feel about bariatric surgery, participants felt that the psychological factors influencing eating behaviours are not being addressed by healthcare. These findings suggest that mindfulness, mindful eating, and self-compassion approaches should be incorporated into clinical practice to support weight regulation and adaption to physiological changes after bariatric surgery.

[PMID: 38237524] This study aimed to describe longitudinal trajectories of Total Weight Loss (%TWL), and mental and physical health related quality of life (HRQOL), as well as to identify preoperative psychological predictors of these trajectories. A prospective observational study including Dutch patients treated with metabolic and bariatric surgery (n = 420, age 44.8 ± 10.3 years, 78.6% females) was performed. Trajectories of %TWL and HRQOL from screening to 1-, 2-, and 3-years post-surgery were described using growth mixture modelling. Multivariable and lasso regression models were used to identify predictors. Three trajectories described %TWL, varying in the degree of first-year weight loss. No pre-surgical psychological factors were associated with %TWL trajectories. We identified four physical and five mental HRQOL trajectories. Approximately 25-30% of patients exhibited patterns of initial improvements followed by decline, or persistently low levels of HRQOL. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with these unfavourable physical HRQOL trajectories (OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.04-1.39), adjusted for confounders. Unfavourable mental HRQOL trajectories were predicted by depressive and anxiety symptoms, neuroticism, insecure attachment, and maladaptive coping. In contrast, self-esteem, extraversion, and conscientiousness were associated with favourable mental HRQOL trajectories. Psychological factors did not predict weight loss, but they significantly impacted patient's HRQOL after metabolic and bariatric surgery. A subgroup with unsuccessful HRQOL after surgery was identified, who would benefit from tailored preoperative counselling to optimize surgery outcomes. Metabolic and bariatric surgery may not be universally beneficial for all patients, challenging the conventional approach to surgical interventions for severe obesity and advocating for a more nuanced, individualized assessment of potential candidates.

[PMID: 38345771] Bariatric surgery has been an effective treatment for severe obesity. However, it can be challenging for bariatric-surgery patients to reach and maintain long-term weight loss. Behavioral interventions may be beneficial in reducing weight and improving the psychological outcomes of bariatric patients. The review intended to evaluate the benefits of mindfulness training for weight management among pre- and postoperative, bariatric-surgery patients and to help determine the design of the most effective mindfulness program for them. The research team performed a systematic narrative review by searching the Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases. The search terms included mindfulness-based therapy, stress reduction, relaxation therapy, meditation, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Eligible studies included those using interventions that examined the impact of mindfulness on weight loss for bariatric-surgery patients. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, the research team conducted a narrative synthesis rather than a meta-analysis. The review took place in the Community Health Sciences Department at the College of Applied Medical Sciences of King Saud University in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Primary outcomes included indicators of body-weight change, such as kilograms, pounds, or BMIs. Secondary outcomes included changes: (1) in eating behavior, such as in binge eating, grazing behavior, craving behavior, and emotional eating, (2) in caloric intake, (3) in mental health, including a reduction in anxiety or depression, (4) in quality of life, (5) mindfulness acceptability and practice, (6) in physical activity, and (7) in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The research team included eight studies in the review. One study aimed to explore the impact of mindfulness on pre-operative patients, and the remaining seven studies measured the impact among postoperative individuals. Most studies suggested that mindfulness-based interventions can have a positive impact on weight outcomes and eating behaviors. The team also found promising effects for mental health outcomes, including anxiety and depression. It's important to note that the included studies reported no strategies that examined treatment fidelity and the monitoring of an intervention's delivery. Preliminary results suggest that mindfulness-based interventions can be useful in tackling eating disorders and in promoting weight loss among bariatric individuals. Further studies are warranted in this area to make explicit recommendations that inform pre- and post-bariatric guidelines. The field needs further well-developed studies to understand the impact of mindfulness on weight loss in the long term.

[PMID: 33233694] This review, focused on food addiction (FA), considers opinions from specialists with different expertise in addiction medicine, nutrition, health psychology, and behavioral neurosciences. The concept of FA is a recurring issue in the clinical description of abnormal eating. Even though some tools have been developed to diagnose FA, such as the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) questionnaire, the FA concept is not recognized as an eating disorder (ED) so far and is even not mentioned in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders version 5 (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Disease (ICD-11). Its triggering mechanisms and relationships with other substance use disorders (SUD) need to be further explored. Food addiction (FA) is frequent in the overweight or obese population, but it remains unclear whether it could articulate with obesity-related comorbidities. As there is currently no validated therapy against FA in obese patients, FA is often underdiagnosed and untreated, so that FA may partly explain failure of obesity treatment, addiction transfer, and weight regain after obesity surgery. Future studies should assess whether a dedicated management of FA is associated with better outcomes, especially after obesity surgery. For prevention and treatment purposes, it is necessary to promote a comprehensive psychological approach to FA. Understanding the developmental process of FA and identifying precociously some high-risk profiles can be achieved via the exploration of the environmental, emotional, and cognitive components of eating, as well as their relationships with emotion management, some personality traits, and internalized weight stigma. Under the light of behavioral neurosciences and neuroimaging, FA reveals a specific brain phenotype that is characterized by anomalies in the reward and inhibitory control processes. These anomalies are likely to disrupt the emotional, cognitive, and attentional spheres, but further research is needed to disentangle their complex relationship and overlap with obesity and other forms of SUD. Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment must rely on a multidisciplinary coherence to adapt existing strategies to FA management and to provide social and emotional support to these patients suffering from highly stigmatized medical conditions, namely overweight and addiction. Multi-level interventions could combine motivational interviews, cognitive behavioral therapies, and self-help groups, while benefiting from modern exploratory and interventional tools to target specific neurocognitive processes.

[PMID: 32477191] Bariatric surgery is seldom accessed by people with serious mental illness, despite high rates of obesity in this population. It is sometimes assumed that patients with complex psychiatric histories will have poor post-surgical weight loss or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, although this is unsubstantiated. A qualitative descriptive study to explore personal experiences and the impact of bariatric surgery on physical and mental well-being and life-quality in individuals with serious mental illness. Nine adults with a history of bariatric surgery and concurrent severe depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder were interviewed about their experiences of bariatric surgery and its outcomes using semi-structured interview schedules. Data were transcribed and inductive thematic analysis undertaken. Five broad themes emerged: (1) surgery was highly effective for weight loss, and resulted in subjective improvements in physical health, quality of life, and mental health described as <i>being able to live a life</i>; (2) recovering from surgery was a <i>tough road</i>, notably in the post-operative period where negative sequelae often anteceded benefits; (3) post-operative support was important, but sometimes insufficient, including from families, mental health services, and surgical teams; (4) most considered surgery life-changing, recommending it to others with mental illness and obesity, two had different experiences; (5) participants considered it discriminatory that people with mental illness were not referred or declined weight loss surgery. Participants benefited from bariatric surgery and felt it should be offered to others with mental illness, but with additional care and support.",10
Basophils promote disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).,basophils AND systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) AND pathogenesis AND contribution,"39844180,38255272,36810600,33338538,30347240,28954264,28801578,27852746,27699260,24209595","[PMID: 39844180] Autophagic activation in immune cells, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and metabolic abnormalities have been reported separately as characteristics of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Elucidating the crosstalk among the immune system, commensal microbiota, and metabolites is crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Emerging evidence shows that basophil activation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SLE; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of autophagic inhibition on the pathogenesis of basophils in SLE using Autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) knockout (Atg5<sup>-/-</sup>) as an autophagic inhibitor. Specifically, we knocked out basophilic Atg5 in vivo to investigate its impact on lupus metabolism. Furthermore, Atg5<sup>-/-</sup> basophils were transferred to basophil-depleted MRL/MpJ-Fas<sup>lpr</sup> (MRL/lpr) mice to study their effect on disease metabolism. Metagenomic and targeted metabolomic sequencing results indicated considerable reduction in the levels of plasma autoantibodies and inflammatory cytokines in the Atg5<sup>-/-</sup> basophil transfer group compared with that in the control group. Transplanting Atg5<sup>-/-</sup> basophils improved the gut microbiota balance in MRL/lpr mice, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Ligilactobacillus murinus and Faecalitalea rodentium, and reducing that of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Phocaeicola salanitronis. The transplantation of Atg5-deficient basophils improved lupus symptoms by modulating lipid and amino acid metabolism. This improvement was linked to changes in the gut microbiota, particularly an increase in Ligilactobacillus murinus and Faecalitalea rodentium populations. These microbial shifts are believed to promote the production of beneficial metabolites, such as γ-linolenic acid and oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, while reducing the levels of harmful metabolites such as arginine. These alterations in the metabolic profile contribute to the alleviation of lupus symptoms. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel role of basophil autophagy in SLE, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

[PMID: 38255272] Double-negative T (DNT) cells are a rare and unconventional T-lymphocyte subpopulation lacking both CD4 and CD8 markers. Their immunopathological roles and clinical relevance have yet to be elucidated. Beyond autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), these cells may also play a role in rheumatic disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); indeed, these two diseases share several autoimmune manifestations (including nephritis). Moreover, one of the main experimental murine models used to investigate lupus, namely the MRL/lpr mouse, is characterized by an expansion of DNT cells, which can support the production of pathogenic autoantibodies and/or modulate the immune response in this context. However, lupus murine models are not completely consistent with their human SLE counterpart, of course. In this mini review, we summarize and analyze the most relevant clinical studies investigating the DNT cell population in SLE patients. Overall, based on the present literature review and analysis, DNT cell homeostasis seems to be altered in patients with SLE. Indeed, most of the available clinical studies (which include both adults and children) reported an increased DNT cell percentage in SLE patients, especially during the active phases, even though no clear correlation with disease activity and/or inflammatory parameters has been clearly established. Well-designed, standardized, and longitudinal clinical studies focused on DNT cell population are needed, in order to further elucidate the actual contribution of these cells in SLE pathogenesis and their interactions with other immune cells (also implicated and/or altered in SLE, such as basophils), and clarify whether their expansion and/or immunophenotypic aspects may have any immunopathological relevance (and, then, represent potential disease markers and, in perspective, even therapeutic targets) or are just an unspecific epiphenomenon of autoimmunity.

[PMID: 36810600] Recently, the involvement of basophils and IgE-type autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of SLE has been elucidated using mouse models; however, few studies have been conducted in humans. In this study, the role of basophils and anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) IgE in SLE was examined using human samples. The correlation between disease activity and serum levels of anti-dsDNA IgE in SLE was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokines produced by IgE-stimulated basophils from healthy subjects were assessed using RNA sequences. The interaction of basophils and B cells to promote B cell differentiation was investigated using a co-culture system. The ability of basophils from patients with SLE with anti-dsDNA IgE to create cytokines that may be involved in B cell differentiation in response to dsDNA was examined using real-time PCR. Anti-dsDNA IgE levels in the serum of patients with SLE correlated with disease activity. Healthy donor basophils produced IL-3, IL-4 and TGF-β1 after anti-IgE stimulation. Co-culture of B cells with anti-IgE-stimulated basophils increased plasmablasts which were cancelled by neutralizing IL-4. After encountering the antigen, basophils released IL-4 more quickly than follicular helper T cells. Basophils isolated from patients with anti-dsDNA IgE promoted IL-4 expression by adding dsDNA. These results suggest that basophils contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE by promoting B cell differentiation via dsDNA-specific IgE in patients similar to the process described in mouse models.

[PMID: 33338538] Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a rare and complex autoimmune disease that presents mixed features with other connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and myositis. It is characterized by high levels of anti-U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70k autoantibodies and a high incidence of life-threatening pulmonary involvement. The pathophysiology of MCTD is not well understood, and no specific treatment is yet available for the patients. Basophils and IgE play a role in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus and thus represent new therapeutic targets for systemic lupus erythematosus and other diseases involving basophils and IgE in their pathogenesis. We sought to investigate the role of basophils and IgE in the pathophysiology of MCTD. Basophil activation status and the presence of autoreactive IgE were assessed in peripheral blood of a cohort of patients with MCTD and in an MCTD-like mouse model. Basophil depletion and IgE-deficient animals were used to investigate the contribution of basophils and IgE in the lung pathology development of this mouse model. Patients with MCTD have a peripheral basopenia and activated blood basophils overexpressing C-C chemokine receptor 3. Autoreactive IgE raised against the main MCTD autoantigen U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70k were found in nearly 80% of the patients from the cohort. Basophil activation and IgE anti-U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70k were also observed in the MCTD-like mouse model along with basophil accumulation in lymph nodes and lungs. Basophil depletion dampened lung pathology, and IgE deficiency prevented its development. Basophils and IgE contribute to MCTD pathophysiology and represent new candidate therapeutic targets for patients with MCTD.

[PMID: 30347240] Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule (SLAM) family receptors are expressed on different types of hematopoietic cells and play important role in immune regulation in health and disease. 2B4 (CD244, SLAMF4) and CS1 (CD319, CRACC, SLAMF7) were originally identified as NK cell receptors regulating NK cell cytolytic activity. 2B4 is expressed on all NK cells, a subpopulation of T cells, monocytes and basophils. Unlike other activating and inhibitory receptors, 2B4 (CD244) interaction with its ligand CD48 has been shown to mediate both activating and inhibitory functions. Defective signaling via 2B4 due to mutations in signaling adaptor SAP contributes to X-linked lymphoproliferative Disease (XLP). Expression of 2B4 and CS1 are altered in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CS1 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma (MM) and anti-CS1 mab (Elotuzumab/Empliciti) has been approved by FDA as a breakthrough drug for treatment for MM patients. CAR -T cells or CAR- NK cells containing full length CS1 or the signaling domain of 2B4 with TCR-ζ have shown promising results to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases.

[PMID: 28954264] Basophils have been reported to infiltrate skin lesions in various skin diseases, but not in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study investigated basophil infiltration in SLE and its mechanism. Twenty newly diagnosed SLE patients and twenty healthy controls were enrolled. Nine SLE patients underwent skin biopsies. Flow cytometric analysis the phenotype of peripheral basophils and their migration rate toward RANTES and MCP-1 were analyzed with the transwell culture system, also the expression of these two chemokines in skin tissue were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Increased activation and decreased numbers of peripheral basophils were observed in SLE patients compared with controls. Basophil migration into skin lesions of SLE patients were observed, but not in normal skin tissue. This migration was related to the upregulation of chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR2 on basophils. In vitro studies showed that migration rate toward RANTES and MCP-1 increased significantly in basophils from SLE patients compared with those from controls. Consistently, high levels of RANTES and MCP-1 expression were observed in skin lesions from SLE patients but not in normal skin tissue. Basophil recruitment to skin lesions of SLE patients mediated by CCR1 and CCR2, which may contribute to tissue damage in SLE.

[PMID: 28801578] Lupus nephritis (LN), one of the most severe outcomes of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is initiated by glomerular deposition of immune-complexes leading to an inflammatory response and kidney failure. Autoantibodies to nuclear antigens and autoreactive B and T cells are central in SLE pathogenesis. Immune mechanisms amplifying this autoantibody production drive flares of the disease. We previously showed that basophils were contributing to LN development in a spontaneous lupus-like mouse model (constitutive Lyn <sup>-/-</sup> mice) and in SLE subjects through their activation and migration to secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) where they amplify autoantibody production. In order to study the basophil-specific mechanisms by which these cells contribute to LN development, we needed to validate their involvement in a genetically independent SLE-like mouse model. Pristane, when injected to non-lupus-prone mouse strains, induces a LN-like disease. In this inducible model, basophils were activated and accumulated in SLOs to promote autoantibody production. Basophil depletion by two distinct approaches dampened LN-like disease, demonstrating their contribution to the pristane-induced LN model. These results enable further studies to decipher molecular mechanisms by which basophils contribute to lupus progression.

[PMID: 27852746] Basophils represent <1% of circulating leukocytes. They play a crucial role during allergy and helminth-induced Th2 responses. However, recent data also suggest a contribution to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Basophils from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus show an activated phenotype, correlating to disease activity. Furthermore, murine basophils or their mediators enhance memory responses and plasma cell (PC) survival, suggesting that they directly modulate the function of B cells. This is highly relevant with respect to human allergy and autoimmunity because a possible modulation of B cell differentiation by basophils could point to new therapeutic targets. Therefore, the interaction between human B cells and basophils and the mechanism underlying this interaction were investigated in detail. Using two different methods to induce PC differentiation, we found that human basophils enhance B cell proliferation, class switching, differentiation into PC, maturation of PC, and production of Igs, especially IgG. Basophil supernatants enhanced the expression of the B cell markers CD23 and CD40, which are important for B cell differentiation into IgG-producing PC. This was mainly IL-4 dependent. IL-3 amplified the number of PC in vitro, and acted synergistically with basophils in enhancing Ab production. Thus, human basophils modulate B cell differentiation into Ab-producing PC. Their contribution as modulators and effectors during allergy and autoimmunity should be considered when designing new therapeutic options.

[PMID: 27699260] To date, the major target of biologic therapeutics in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been the B cell, which produces pathogenic autoantibodies. Recently, targeting type I IFN, which is elaborated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in response to endosomal TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation by SLE immune complexes, has shown promising results. pDCs express high levels of the IL-3Rα chain (CD123), suggesting an alternative potential targeting strategy. We have developed an anti-CD123 monoclonal antibody, CSL362, and show here that it affects key cell types and cytokines that contribute to SLE. CSL362 potently depletes pDCs via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, markedly reducing TLR7, TLR9, and SLE serum-induced IFN-α production and IFN-α-upregulated gene expression. The antibody also inhibits TLR7- and TLR9-induced plasmablast expansion by reducing IFN-α and IL-6 production. These effects are more pronounced than with IFN-α blockade alone, possibly because pDC depletion reduces production of other IFN subtypes, such as type III, as well as non-IFN proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6. In addition, CSL362 depletes basophils and inhibits IL-3 signaling. These effects were confirmed in cells derived from a heterogeneous population of SLE donors, various IFN-dependent autoimmune diseases, and healthy controls. We also demonstrate in vivo activity of CSL362 following its s.c. administration to cynomolgus monkeys. This spectrum of effects provides a preclinical rationale for the therapeutic evaluation of CSL362 in SLE.

[PMID: 24209595] Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex autoimmune disease of multifactorial origins. All compartments of the immune system appear to be affected, at least in some way, and to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Because of an escape from negative selection autoreactive T and B cells accumulate in SLE patients leading to the production of autoantibodies mainly raised against nuclear components and their subsequent deposition into target organs. We recently showed that basophils, in an IgE and IL-4 dependent manner, contribute to SLE pathogenesis by amplifying autoantibody production. Here, we summarize what we have learned about the deleterious role of basophils in lupus both in a mouse model and in SLE patients. We discuss which possible pathways could be involved in basophil activation and recruitment to secondary lymphoid organs during SLE, and how basophils may amplify autoantibody production.",10
Binding of p53 to enhancer regions (p53BERs) regulates the activity of p53 transcription and cell cycle arrest through the production of p53-dependent eRNAs.,p53 AND enhancer regions AND eRNAs AND cell cycle arrest,"26776159,25813522,23273978,41187362,41187350,41187347,41187341,41187308,41187279,41187246","[PMID: 26776159] Genome-wide chromatin studies identified the tumor suppressor p53 as both a promoter and an enhancer-binding transcription factor. As an enhancer factor, p53 can induce local production of enhancer RNAs, as well as transcriptional activation of distal neighboring genes. Beyond the regulation of protein-coding genes, p53 has the capacity to regulate long intergenic noncoding RNA molecules (lincRNAs); however, their importance to the p53 tumor suppressive function remains poorly characterized. Here, we identified and characterized a novel p53-bound intronic enhancer that controls the expression of its host, the lincRNA00475 (linc-475). We demonstrate the requirement of linc-475 for the proper induction of a p53-dependent cell cycle inhibitory response. We further confirm the functional importance of linc-475 in the maintenance of CDKN1A/p21 levels, a cell cycle inhibitor and a major p53 target gene, following p53 activation. Interestingly, loss of linc-475 reduced the binding of both p53 and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to the promoter of p21, attenuating its transcription rate following p53 activation. Altogether, our data suggest a direct role of p53-bound enhancer domains in the activation of lincRNAs required for an efficient p53 transcriptional response.

[PMID: 25813522] p53 binds enhancers to regulate key target genes. Here, we globally mapped p53-regulated enhancers by looking at enhancer RNA (eRNA) production. Intriguingly, while many p53-induced enhancers contained p53-binding sites, most did not. As long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are prominent regulators of chromatin dynamics, we hypothesized that p53-induced lncRNAs contribute to the activation of enhancers by p53. Among p53-induced lncRNAs, we identified LED and demonstrate that its suppression attenuates p53 function. Chromatin-binding and eRNA expression analyses show that LED associates with and activates strong enhancers. One prominent target of LED was located at an enhancer region within CDKN1A gene, a potent p53-responsive cell cycle inhibitor. LED knockdown reduces CDKN1A enhancer induction and activity, and cell cycle arrest following p53 activation. Finally, promoter-associated hypermethylation analysis shows silencing of LED in human tumours. Thus, our study identifies a new layer of complexity in the p53 pathway and suggests its dysregulation in cancer.

[PMID: 23273978] Binding within or nearby target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival enables the p53 tumor suppressor gene to regulate their transcription and cell-cycle progression. Using genome-wide chromatin-binding profiles, we describe binding of p53 also to regions located distantly from any known p53 target gene. Interestingly, many of these regions possess conserved p53-binding sites and all known hallmarks of enhancer regions. We demonstrate that these p53-bound enhancer regions (p53BERs) indeed contain enhancer activity and interact intrachromosomally with multiple neighboring genes to convey long-distance p53-dependent transcription regulation. Furthermore, p53BERs produce, in a p53-dependent manner, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that are required for efficient transcriptional enhancement of interacting target genes and induction of a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest. Thus, our results ascribe transcription enhancement activity to p53 with the capacity to regulate multiple genes from a single genomic binding site. Moreover, eRNA production from p53BERs is required for efficient p53 transcription enhancement.

[PMID: 41187362] The risk of a foreign animal disease coming into the United States and threatening the swine industry necessitates the need for enhanced biosecurity plans to mitigate risks to premises. Although most biosecurity information is aimed and created for larger producers and isn't appropriate for smaller producers, such as swine exhibitors. Swine exhibitors are a niche group who raise swine differently than large producers and travel extensively with their animals. This study sought out to; develop a SPS plan template adapted from the SPS framework that would be suitable for swine exhibitors' biosecurity features; describe basic demographics and existence of biosecurity plan (and their features) for the target population; and investigate the association between having a previous biosecurity plan on site and demographic factors (number of pigs, type of housing, presence of other animal species in the premise and geographical region) as well as potential exposure to feral swine under their current housing conditions. These objectives were accomplished by attending twelve swine exhibitions within a year and a half to assist 161 individuals in the creation of personalized biosecurity plans for their premises, while obtaining additional study data. This study found no significant relationship between demographic factors and previously having a biosecurity plan, but that only 31.8 % of participants had previous biosecurity plans on their premise. However, swine exhibitors with existing biosecurity plans had more than 3-fold higher odds of acknowledging housing conditions with potential of feral swine contact compared to swine exhibitors without preexisting biosecurity plans. These findings indicate the need for additional efforts to assist swine exhibitors in creating biosecurity plans at shows across the United States.

[PMID: 41187350] Understanding community disaster resilience is critical to mitigating the disproportionate impacts of climate change and natural disasters on socially vulnerable populations. However, despite extensive discussion on disaster resilience, a systematic analysis of the extent of social inequity across climate scenarios, geographic locations, spatial scales, and sociodemographic groups remains underexplored. Our study introduces a human-centric framework to investigate social inequities in community disaster resilience related to human well-being. We combined flood hazard maps under both historical and future SSP scenarios with a compound multilayer urban spatial network model consisting of roads, communities, and essential services to evaluate the residents' service resilience during flood events. Then, we utilized the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve to quantify the degree of inequities in resilience among different sub-populations. With Central Chongqing as a case study, our analysis reveals a significant increase in both the number of affected communities and their vulnerability under future climate conditions. We further observed a striking spatial polarization in community resilience due to the islanding effect, whereby communities are increasingly divided into those with severely limited service availability and those with sufficient resources. In addition, we found that the extent of social inequity in resilience is highly spatial and scale-specific, with moderate levels of inequity at the city level, but the degree of inequity varies greatly across sociodemographic groups at a localized level. This widening socio-spatial differentiation may trigger widespread dissatisfaction in disadvantaged communities, hindering the collective disaster response actions and engagements to enhance community resilience. Our research highlights the importance of embedding future climate variabilities, human well-being, and social equity in inclusive disaster response policies, processes, and practices.

[PMID: 41187347] Bipolar re-referencing, in which one electrode's signal is subtracted from a neighboring electrode to produce a differential signal, can improve signal readability and refine localization for intracranial electroencephalography. There is wide variation in manufactured electrode array spacing, yet how bipolar re-referencing affects specific frequencies at precise inter-electrode distances has not been systematically evaluated. &#xD;Intracranial recordings with uniquely large numbers of electrodes were obtained for sixteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We evaluated combinations of high-density subdural grid, depth, and strip electrodes (n=3,664, 742, and 336) with manufactured linear inter-electrode distances of 4, 5, and 10mm, respectively. Bipolar re-referencing was performed using all possible electrode pairs (n=445,305 grid, 16,004 depth, 3,278 strip) spanning distances from 2-60mm. Multi-taper power spectra were generated separately for grid, depth, and strip contacts. Distances were consolidated across patients and anatomical areas for generalizability, and distance-related influences on task-related brain activity and quantitative IED localization were evaluated. &#xD;We identified 8mm as a consistent reversal point for bipolar re-referencing, below which low-frequency signals (<30 Hz) had consistently decreased power, and higher frequencies had increased power. Larger distances increased all broadband (2-200 Hz) signals. Task-related increases in superior temporal gyrus 50-200 Hz activity were consistently enhanced across 4-40mm bipolar distances. There were non-significant difference trends between 4 and 8mm re-referencing on epileptiform discharge detection. &#xD;Bipolar re-referencing distance imposed specific transition points for distance and frequency (roughly 8mm and ~30 Hz, respectively) that produced differential effects on measurements of signal power. The consistency across brain regions and electrode types (depth, subdural) suggests these influences are physical brain bio-signal properties, potentially related to spatial wavelength of periodic oscillations in lower frequencies in contrast to more aperiodic activity in higher frequencies. A distance-frequency relation map is provided to help optimize neural signal biomarker quality for intracranial applications by guiding strategic re-referencing distance selection.

[PMID: 41187341] Although acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a preventable condition, it continues to be diagnosed in Far North Queensland, Australia. Enhanced primary prevention is necessary to reduce the local burden of ARF and rheumatic heart disease. In this retrospective clinical audit, all cases of definite ARF in the remote Torres Strait and Cape York region of Far North Queensland between January 2020 and December 2024 were examined. Clinical records were reviewed to identify and characterize any healthcare presentations of individuals during the 6 weeks preceding their ARF diagnosis. Of 67 individuals with definite ARF 65 (97%) identified as First Nations Australians; 43/67 (64%) did not present for any healthcare in the 6 weeks preceding their diagnosis; and a further 10/67 (15%) presented for healthcare that was unrelated to group A Streptococcus (Strep A) infection. Overall, a possible Strep A infection (skin infection or sore throat) was identified in 14/67 (21%) patients; 9/67 (13%) patients presented with skin infections, and 5/67 (7%) presented with sore throats. Of these, 5/14 (36%) received appropriate antibiotic treatment. Most individuals with definite ARF in this remote region of Australia do not present for healthcare before their diagnosis; however, there remain opportunities for the primary prevention of ARF among those who do. Culturally considered health promotion, opportunistic screening, and improved recognition and treatment of Strep A infection are critical for reducing ARF incidence in this region of Australia. It is also important to define the contribution of asymptomatic Strep A infections to the pathogenesis of ARF.

[PMID: 41187279] Since January 2022, Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates has implemented the 4-day work week model for the first time in the public and private sectors, including universities. While this framework may enhance productivity and work-life balance for many professionals, the current study specifically explores the perceptions of students in medicine, dentistry, and health sciences programs regarding the impact of transitioning from a 5-day to a 4-day work week on their academic performance. The objective of this study was to explore and analyze the perceptions of students in medicine, dentistry, and health sciences regarding the implementation of a 4-day academic week in the Emirate of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Twenty-four university students (mean age 20.95, SD 1.30 years; 12 men) studying in medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, nursing, or medical diagnostic imaging programs, who experienced a transition from a 5-day week to a 4-day week, participated in semistructured interviews lasting approximately 20-30 minutes. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The Braun and Clarke 6-phase framework of thematic analysis was used. We identified 5 themes: academic journey, academic work-life balance, support systems, classroom dynamics, and common stressors of the 4-day academic week. Overall, most students reported increased motivation, engagement, and academic achievement following the transition from a 5-day to a 4-day week. In addition, participants described a positive academic work-life balance, improved physical and mental well-being, optimal use of time for both academic and personal commitments, favorable support from faculty and family members, and maintained or even improved attendance levels. Nevertheless, some students expressed concerns about condensed schedules and longer days, increased stress, disrupted work-life balance, and inadequate support systems to cope with this new framework. Overall, the 4-day academic week enhanced motivation, academic performance, work-life balance, and the physical and mental well-being of medicine, dental, and health science students. However, some students experienced challenges related to condensed schedules and increased stress. These mixed outcomes highlight that while the 4-day work week offers notable advantages, careful planning and support are essential to mitigate the potential drawbacks and ensure all students can succeed within this new academic framework. Future research could explore strategies to address these challenges and further improve the 4-day week experience for all students.

[PMID: 41187246] Adult female acne presents challenges, including increased prevalence, distinct clinical manifestations, heightened skin sensitivity, treatment-related intolerance, and reduced treatment adherence. Integrating skincare into acne management is essential, particularly in Nordic European countries, where environmental factors influence skin physiology. The Nordic European Countries Acne Skincare Algorithm (NECASA) II algorithm serves as an evidence-based practical tool for clinicians in this region to select appropriate skincare based on individual patients' needs to optimize acne care for adult females. Dermatologists from six Nordic European countries met to develop the NECASA II algorithm, which builds on the NECASA I framework. The advisors conducted a structured literature review and, combined with their clinical experience, established best practice recommendations for integrating skincare into adult female acne treatment regimens. The NECASA II algorithm recommends integrating skincare into adult female acne management based on acne severity, subtype, and patient characteristics. The panel concluded that all acne regimens should incorporate a physiologic pH cleanser, an emollient with humectants and lipids, and SPF 50+ sunscreen. Skincare monotherapy is recommended for mild acne, adjunctive skincare for moderate-to-severe acne, and maintenance skincare to prevent relapse following treatment. Personalized skincare regimens, combined with prescription and nonprescription treatments, can mitigate adverse effects, improve treatment tolerance and adherence, and enhance overall outcomes.",10
Blocking the interaction between TDP-43 and respiratory complex I proteins ND3 and ND6 prevents TDP-43-induced neuronal loss.,TDP-43 AND ND3 AND ND6 AND respiratory complex I,"27348499,41185975,41185066,41182881,41181712,41180957,41178159,41174170,41174004,41170710","[PMID: 27348499] Genetic mutations in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP, also known as TDP-43) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and an increase in the presence of TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP) in the cytoplasm is a prominent histopathological feature of degenerating neurons in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 contributes to ALS pathophysiology remain elusive. Here we have found that TDP-43 accumulates in the mitochondria of neurons in subjects with ALS or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Disease-associated mutations increase TDP-43 mitochondrial localization. In mitochondria, wild-type (WT) and mutant TDP-43 preferentially bind mitochondria-transcribed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding respiratory complex I subunits ND3 and ND6, impair their expression and specifically cause complex I disassembly. The suppression of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization abolishes WT and mutant TDP-43-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss, and improves phenotypes of transgenic mutant TDP-43 mice. Thus, our studies link TDP-43 toxicity directly to mitochondrial bioenergetics and propose the targeting of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization as a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41185975] BiFeO<sub>3</sub> and Nd<sup>3+</sup>-doped BiFeO<sub>3</sub> nanorods were successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method. Characterization revealed that Nd<sup>3+</sup>-doping induced a structural transformation from a rhombohedral (<i>R</i>3<i>c</i>) to an orthorhombic (<i>Pnma</i>) phase. The decrease in Raman modes further confirms the structural changes. These structural changes, along with the nanoscale dimensions (around 50 nm diameter), significantly enhanced both the photocatalytic activity and magnetic properties of the Nd<sup>3+</sup>-doped BiFeO<sub>3</sub> nanorods. XPS analysis confirmed the successful incorporation of Nd<sup>3+</sup> into BiFeO<sub>3</sub> and revealed the presence of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions. In addition, UV-Vis spectroscopy showed that the material has excellent visible light absorption, which is slightly red-shifted as a result of doping. We observed greater ferromagnetism in Nd<sup>3+</sup>-BiFeO<sub>3</sub>, which we attribute to a structural change that breaks down its antiferromagnetic spin cycloid ordering. The improved photocatalytic performance of the Nd<sup>3+</sup>-BiFeO<sub>3</sub> nanorods is attributed to the band bending process and more efficient electron-hole (e<sup>-</sup>-h<sup>+</sup>) separation, suggesting their potential for degrading organic pollutants.

[PMID: 41185066] Lewy body dementia is the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, following Alzheimer's disease. This umbrella term encompasses dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). The distinction between these two conditions lies in the timing of the onset of cognitive impairment relative to motor symptoms. In DLB, cognitive impairment precedes or coincides with motor symptoms within the first year, whereas in PDD, cognitive decline occurs more than a year after the onset of motor symptoms. Clinically, in addition to cognitive decline, patients with Lewy body dementia have parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and fluctuations of cognitive status. The pathological hallmark of this condition is the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, collectively referred to as Lewy-related pathology. This is identical to Parkinson's disease, where dementia is not observed. The principal component of Lewy-related pathology is α-synuclein, which classifies this disorder as an α-synucleinopathy. While Lewy-related pathology represents a later stage of α-synuclein aggregation, earlier stages involve α-synuclein oligomers. Emerging evidence suggests α-synuclein oligomers may be more toxic than Lewy-related pathology. In addition to α-synuclein pathology, previous studies frequently observed comorbid pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, and cerebral small vessel disease among others. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the underlying pathologies for Lewy body dementia and their molecular mechanisms and clinical implications. We also discuss concepts including the prion-like propagation hypothesis of α-synuclein, α-synuclein strain hypothesis, and recent advances in machine learning algorithms for analyzing propagation patterns. The purpose of this manuscript is to elucidate these complex pathological conditions, advance our understanding of the disease, and improve diagnostic strategies.

[PMID: 41182881] The RING-H2 type E3 ligase Praja family is composed of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases Praja1 and Praja2, which promote the degradation of substrates through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Both paralogs contribute to neuronal maturation and differentiation, indicating a significant role in the nervous system. Aggregation-prone proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and α-synuclein, are degraded and/or suppressed by Praja1. Furthermore, the expression level of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene, which is frequently mutated in Alzheimer's disease, is regulated by Praja2. Although the Praja family has been shown to recognize various aggregation-prone proteins as substrates, it has not been determined whether tau, a key protein that aggregates in tauopathies, is also recognized by Praja proteins. In this study, we show that Praja1, but not Praja2, recognizes tau as a candidate substrate. We observed that the tau protein level in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells decreased depending on the E3 ligase activity of Praja1. Furthermore, the in vivo/in vitro ubiquitination assay showed that Praja1 ubiquitinates tau, indicating that it is a target substrate. Next, by combining ancestral sequence reconstruction and mutational analysis, we revealed that the Praja1-tau interaction began just after the duplication of the Praja family in the common ancestor of placentals. Lastly, to test whether this interaction is disrupted under pathological conditions, P301L tau was introduced, resulting in a degradation similar to that of wild-type tau. These results reveal an unidentified mechanism of tau proteostasis by Praja1 and may provide insight into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathy.

[PMID: 41181712] Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a key factor in motor neurons and related neurodegenerative disorders, and the presence of cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 is a major hallmark of diseases such amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Nevertheless, little is known about early developmental effects or the systemic nature of TDP-43-mediated pathology. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is acknowledged as a powerful genetic model for studying the genetic inheritance and the behavioral and developmental processes associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. To better understand the possible roles and potential pathogenic mechanisms of TDP-43 protein in the pathogenesis of ALS, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of larvae from a <i>Drosophila</i> model knock-out (KO) for the <i>TBPH</i> gene, the fly <i>TDP-43</i> ortholog. Interestingly, the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis highlighted some pathways not yet associated with this pathology and this model. We identified several genes encoding for serine proteases, a class of enzymes that in the central nervous system (CNS) play important roles in neural development, synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration. Our work provides insights into novel pathological mechanisms underlying the disease, thereby opening new pathways for drug discovery.

[PMID: 41180957] Stathmin-2 (STMN2) levels decline in brains with transactive response DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) inclusions. TDP-43-related changes could extend to ocular structures, although vitreous STMN2 levels remain uncharacterized. This exploratory study analyzed 72 post-mortem brains and eyes depending on the presence or absence of TDP-43 inclusions in the brain and across neuropathological diagnostic groups (Alzheimer's disease [AD], chronic traumatic encephalopathy [CTE], AD and CTE, or neither). Results showed decreased vitreous STMN2 levels in TDP-43-positive cases but no association with diagnostic groups. Vitreous STMN2 was correlated with vitreous neurofilament light chain. Diminished vitreous STMN2 levels might indicate TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41178159] TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein that aggregates in the brains of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease. Aggregated TDP-43 in these diseases is hyperphosphorylated in its C-terminal intrinsically disordered region, while physiological TDP-43 is normally unphosphorylated. Whether TDP-43 phosphorylation is a pathological driver, or rather a protective antagonist of TDP-43 aggregation and consequently neurodegeneration, is still debated and a matter of ongoing research. Here, we review current knowledge about TDP-43 phosphorylation in disease and the kinases and phosphatases that regulate this post-translational modification. We discuss how TDP-43 phosphorylation is thought to shape TDP-43's phase separation, aggregation and toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases. We highlight recent research that provides evidence that hyperphosphorylation antagonizes TDP-43 phase separation and aggregation, and speculate about a potential role of condensates in TDP-43 phosphorylation.

[PMID: 41174170] Motor neuron hyperexcitability is a broadly observed yet poorly understood feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA splicing protein TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are observed in most ALS and FTD patients. Here we show that TDP-43 dysfunction causes mis-splicing of KCNQ2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel (K<sub>v</sub>7.2) that regulates neuronal excitability. Using iPSC-derived neurons and postmortem ALS/FTD brain and spinal cord tissue we find widespread, disease-specific and TDP-43-specific skipping of an exon encoding the KCNQ2 pore domain. The mis-spliced mRNA escapes degradation and is translated into a nonfunctional protein with severely reduced ion conductance that aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum and causes intrinsic hyperexcitability in ALS neuronal models. This event, which correlates with higher phosphorylated TDP-43 levels and earlier age of disease onset in patients, can be rescued by splice-modulating antisense oligonucleotides that dampen hyperexcitability in induced pluripotent stem cell cortical neurons and spinal motor neurons with TDP-43 depletion. Our work reveals that nuclear TDP-43 maintains the fidelity of KCNQ2 expression and function and provides a mechanistic link between established excitability disruption in ALS/FTD patients and TDP-43 dysfunction.

[PMID: 41174004] In multiple neurodegenerative diseases, the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic aggregates of distinct morphologies, including skein-like, small rounded granular and large spherical inclusions. Here, whereas the N-terminal self-oligomerization domain regulates TDP-43 demixing into cytoplasmic droplets, inhibition of N-terminal self-oligomerization domain-mediated oligomerization is shown to promote the formation of skein-like inclusions. Utilizing proximity labelling-mass spectrometry, cellular stresses are shown to induce TDP-43 association with actin-binding proteins that include filamins and α-actinin. Small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of filamin in Drosophila ameliorates cell loss from cytoplasmic TDP-43, consistent with the filamin-TDP-43 interaction enhancing cytotoxicity. TDP-43's association with actin-binding proteins is mediated by BAG3, a HSP70 family nucleotide exchange factor that regulates the proteostasis of actin-binding proteins. BAG2, another HSP70 nucleotide exchange factor, facilitates the formation of small, rounded TDP-43 inclusions. We demonstrate that both TDP-43 self-oligomerization and its binding partners, including HSP70 and cochaperones BAG2 and BAG3, drive the formation of the different types of TDP-43 inclusion.

[PMID: 41170710] RNA granules are dynamic, membraneless organelles essential for the spatial and temporal regulation of mRNA metabolism, particularly in neurons, where local protein synthesis supports synaptic plasticity and function. This review explores the diverse types of RNA granules (e.g., transport granules, stress granules, and processing bodies), their formation mechanisms, molecular composition, and relevance to synaptic physiology. We focus on the central role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in orchestrating granule dynamics and their fine-tuning of synaptic responses under both physiological and stress conditions. Mounting evidence implicates the dysfunction of RNA granules in neurodegenerative diseases. Altered phase separation, RBP aggregation, and persistent stress granules contribute to the formation of pathological RNA granules that interfere with local translation and synaptic maintenance. Key RBPs, including TDP-43, FUS, and TIA-1, are frequently misregulated in disease contexts. Furthermore, Tau is a multifunctional protein traditionally associated with microtubule stabilization but is increasingly recognized for its role in the translational stress response, which includes RBP mislocalization and RNA granule disruption. We examine how chronic stress can exacerbate these mechanisms, acting as an environmental trigger of synaptic vulnerability associated with neurodegeneration. In summary, we explore a conceptual framework connecting RNA granule dysregulation, Tau pathology, and local translation disruption, three processes that converge on synaptic impairment, a central feature of many neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal Tau. Investigating this triad presents a promising avenue for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying novel therapeutic targets that aim to restore RNA metabolism, prevent toxic Tau interactions, and preserve synaptic health.",10

It is a relatively simple and easy procedure for evaluating pyrexia of unknown origin, as it often leads to an etiological diagnosis. The study aims to evaluate the clinico-hematological profile in various infections infiltrating bone marrow and study the spectrum of morphologic alterations in bone marrow aspirate in various infections. This retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Bihar, India, over a 4.5-year period (June 2019-December 2023). All patients referred to the haematology section for bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy based on strong clinical and morphological suspicion of infection were included. Cases with inadequate marrow samples or lacking corroborative infection evidence were excluded. The study included a total of 52casesdemonstratingthe presence of bone marrow infections. Out of 52 cases, bone marrow aspirations were done in all cases, whereas bone marrow biopsy was done in 23(44.2%) cases only. There were 39 (75%) cases of adults and 13 (25%) of children; and the mean age of presentation was 35.3 years (range, 1-72 years).On clinical examination, anemia was the most common symptom (82.6%), followed by splenomegaly (78.8%). On bone marrow examination, an increase in plasma cells was the most striking finding, accounting for 67.3% (n=35), followed by erythroid hyperplasia and an increased number of macrophages showing features of hemophagocytosis in 50% and 32.6% of cases, respectively. A total of 41 cases showed the presence of Leishmania Donovani (LD) bodies. Granulomas were seen in 09 cases (17.3%), out of which 05(9.6%) cases showed AFB positivity. Bone marrow examination plays a pivotal role in diagnosing various infectious diseases, particularly in patients presenting with pyrexia of unknown origin, cytopenias, or unexplained hematological abnormalities. Morphological analysis, along with specialized staining techniques, allows the identification of a broad spectrum of infectious agents, spanning from parasites and bacteria to fungi.

[PMID: 41156624] This study aimed to evaluate cytokine profiling in a periapical lesion to provide a rationale for future treatment strategies for periapical lesions. Thirteen samples of exudative fluid were collected from such a lesion directly through the root canal. Cytokine profiling was performed using the Bio-Plex system. CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, IP10) was found to be elevated in apical exudates of patients exhibiting favorable healing. To evaluate the role of CXCL10 in cell migration, a Transwell assay was conducted using bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMCs). Different types of cytokines were detected from the samples of periapical lesion at the initial visit. However, cytokine production varied across patient samples. Release of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α showed differential expression. Comparison of cytokine profiles indicated that cytokine production was variable before and after root canal treatment. In vitro, CXCL10 significantly improved BMMC migration in a dose-dependent manner, supporting clinical findings that elevated CXCL10 levels are associated with favorable healing in apical lesions. Although this study was limited by the small sample size and exploratory design, the cytokine profile of periapical lesions may be useful for assessing the condition of periapical lesions and modulating the immune response to bacterial infection.

[PMID: 41137146] Since Hoffa's fat pad (HFP) is naturally involved in the joint environment, and given findings that HFP-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) possess better chondrogenic differentiation capacity than other adipose tissue sources or bone marrow, we aimed to analyze HFP-MSCs derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) primed with blood products as potential cell-free osteoarthritis (OA) therapy. HFP-MSCs were cultured under 3D conditions on microcarriers in vertical-wheel bioreactors. Prior to medium harvest, MSCs were primed with blood products, including fetal calf serum (FCS), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or hyperacute serum (HypACT). EVs were isolated via ultrafiltration and characterized via cryo-electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) in both scatter and fluorescence modes, as well as via Western blot (WB). CFSE-labeled EV internalization by chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts was detected using fluorescent confocal microscopy in the presence or absence of polybrene. Polybrene was used to enhance EV internalization and potentially improve treatment efficacy in cells. To simulate an OA environment, chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts were co-cultured with M1 macrophages. Gene expression changes were analyzed via RT-qPCR, while cytokine release was quantified using ELISA. HFP-MSC-EVs downregulated the expression of catabolic enzyme genes MMP3 and MMP13 in chondrocytes, as well as the inflammatory genes CCL5 and COX2 in synovial fibroblasts. COL2A gene expression was upregulated in chondrocytes treated with HFP-MSC-EVs from a young donor. Furthermore, HFP-MSC-EVs elevated the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 from chondrocyte and synovial fibroblast co-cultured with M1 macrophages. HFP-MSC-EVs also upregulated IL10 gene expression in M1 macrophages. Polybrene significantly enhanced the internalization of HFP-MSC-EVs by chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts, but did not improve treatment efficacy. HFP-MSC-EVs may have therapeutic potential mediated by attenuating inflammation and downregulation of catabolic enzymes in cells critical to OA progression.

[PMID: 41126352] The occurrence and extent of central nervous system (CNS) fiber tract inflammation in chronic-phase intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients are not well understood due to the heterogeneity of Wallerian degeneration (WD). This study aims to investigate the presence of CNS fiber tract inflammation in chronic-phase ICH patients and to characterize any inflammatory cells in the fiber tract. An in vivo translocator protein (TSPO)-PET study was undertaken in 22 ICH patients over 6 months after stroke who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University or Tianjin Medical University General Hospital from April 2017 to June 2020. Twenty-three healthy controls or participants with various CNS diseases were included. Cerebral peduncle (CP) TSPO uptake was calculated as the average standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr). To aid interpretation of the TSPO uptake results at the CNS fiber tract level, spatial transcriptome sequencing was used to identify fiber tract inflammation in an ICH mouse model at 4wks post-onset and to characterize the cells present in the inflamed fiber tract. PET imaging showed that CP TSPO SUVr values in patients over 6 months since ICH were higher than in healthy controls (mean CP SUVr ± SD; ICH: 1.19 ± 0.11; control: 1.02 ± 0.08; P < 0.0001), and there was an obvious negative correlation between CP TSPO uptake and CP volume, which means that the CNS fiber tract inflammation persists and is still active in chronic-phase ICH patients, which may worsen their prognosis. Spatial transcriptome sequencing of the CNS fiber tract in ICH model mice identified a population of peripheral-derived pro-inflammatory macrophages contributing to the increased TSPO uptake. CP uptake was associated with frontal bone marrow uptake according to association analyses, indicating the cells possibly extending from the skull bone marrow into CNS in the chronic phase.

[PMID: 41056512] Investigation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of disease progression from precursor plasma cell disorders to active disease increases our understanding of multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis and supports the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In this analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, surface protein profiling, and B lymphocyte antigen receptor profiling of unsorted, whole bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cell samples was used to study molecular changes in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). A cell atlas of the BM microenvironment was generated from 123 subjects including healthy volunteers and patients with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), smoldering MM (SMM), and MM. These analyses revealed commonalities in molecular pathways, including MYC signaling, E2F targets and interferon alpha response, that were altered during disease progression. Evidence of early dysregulation of the immune system in MGUS and SMM, which increases and impacts many cell types as the disease progresses, was found. In parallel with disease progression, population shifts in CD8 + T cells, macrophages, and classical dendritic cells were observed, and the resulting differences in CD8 + T cells and macrophages were associated with poor overall survival outcomes. Potential ligand-receptor interactions that may play a role during the transition from precursor stages to MM were identified, along with potential biomarkers of disease progression, some of which may represent novel therapeutic targets. MIF, IL15, CD320, HGF and FAM3C were detected as potential regulators of the TME by plasma cells, while SERPINA1 and BAFF (TNFSF13B) were found to have the highest potential to contribute to the downstream changes observed between precursor stage and MM cells. These findings demonstrate that myeloma tumorigenesis is associated with dysregulation of molecular pathways driven by gradually occurring immunophenotypic changes in the tumor and TME. Trial registration: This project has been registered at EudraCT (European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database) with protocol number NOPRODMMY0001 and EudraCT Number 2018-004443-23 on 12 December 2018.

[PMID: 41041338] Macrophage polarization into M1 or M2 phenotypes is a complex process influenced by various factors. However, existing literature and ongoing research support the view that Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (CDK5) may play an important role in this process. CDK5 is a protein kinase that requires association with regulatory, co-activating proteins, p35 (CDK5R1) or p39 (CDK5R2), for functional activation. This study investigated the role of the p35 protein in regulating M1 and M2 polarization. We compared bone marrow derived macrophages from wild type (WT) and p35 knockout (KO) mice under both M1 (IFNγ + LPS) and M2 (IL4) conditions, differentiated with M-CSF or GM-CSF. The expression of surface markers (CD86, CD206), enzyme expression (Arginase-1 and iNOS), metabolism and antigen process and presentation were compared. While p35 had modest effect on phenotype during M1 or M2 polarization, p35 expression was important for Arginase1 induction after M2 polarization. The absence of p35 significantly increased glycolysis during M1 polarization, while it also enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the context of M2 polarization. While p35 was important for antigen processing by M0 and M2, M1 were able to maintain capacity to process antigen albeit with a reduction due to decreased stability of peptide: MHC II complex. While loss of p35 resulted in minor changes in phenotype, there were decreases in ARG-1 production and STAT3 phosphorylation, increased metabolism, and dramatically reduced antigen processing by M0, M1 or M2. The absence of p35 enhanced antigen uptake, but it had no effect on degradation of antigen, suggesting an inability to produce peptide: MHC II complexes in the absence of p35 in M0 and M2. In contrast, p35-deficient M1 maintained an ability to rapidly produce peptide: MHC II complexes but showed a reduction in the stability of these complexes on the surface. Our findings reveal a crucial role for p35 in regulating macrophage metabolism and antigen function, with implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

[PMID: 40986027] This study aimed to investigate the role of pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) in macrophage-driven allergic rhinitis (AR) pathogenesis using both in vivo and in vitro experimental models. Myeloid-specific PKM2 knockout (PKM2<sup>mye-KO</sup>) and littermate control (PKM2<sup>WT</sup>) mice were used, along with human nasal mucosa samples from AR patients and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). BMDMs were treated with the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 (100 µM) or vehicle prior to house dust mite (HDM) stimulation. Histological and immunological analyses were performed on human and murine tissues. Cytokine expression, nuclear translocation, and metabolic markers were assessed in BMDMs following HDM stimulation. Statistical significance was evaluated using appropriate tests (e.g., Student's t-test or ANOVA). PKM2 levels and macrophage infiltration were elevated in AR patient nasal mucosa. PKM2<sup>mye-KO</sup> mice showed reduced allergic inflammation, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α), and suppressed STAT3 activation compared to controls. TEPP-46 treatment attenuated HDM-induced cytokine release and nuclear PKM2 translocation. PKM2 regulates macrophage-mediated inflammation in AR via STAT3-dependent pathways, suggesting its nuclear translocation and interaction with STAT3 as potential therapeutic targets for allergic diseases.

[PMID: 40875958] Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a potential cellular therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been suggested that MSCs from patients with MS have lower immunomodulatory properties than those from healthy controls (HCs). The aims of this study were to compare the immunomodulatory abilities of MSCs from patients with MS and HCs against autologous immune cells and to identify potential targets affecting this ability. MSCs were obtained by bone marrow aspiration from 5 people with MS and 7 HCs. Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated in monoculture or co-culture with MSCs and tested for T-cell expression of IL-17, IFN-γ, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by flow cytometry. Supernatants of monoculture unstimulated MSCs were tested for a panel of cytokines and chemokines using multiplex array or individual ELISA. Gene expression profiling in MSCs was studied using Lexogen QuantSeq RNA-seq platform and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The MSCs from HCs reduced the proportion of autologous T cells expressing IL-17 (Th17, <i>p</i> = 0.046), IFN-γ (Th1, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and GM-CSF (<i>p</i> = 0.012), whereas MSCs from patients with MS had an opposite effect, increasing both autologous Th17 cells (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and GM-CSF-expressing T cells (<i>p</i> = 0.03), with no changes in Th1 cell abundance. Unstimulated MSCs from patients with MS produced less IL-10 (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and more osteopontin (OPN) (<i>p</i> = 0.002) than those from HCs. Gene expression profiling suggested an increase of ADAM28 in the MS MSCs. This was further confirmed at mRNA (by quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]) and protein (by flow cytometry) levels. Co-cultures of MS MSCs and autologous PBMCs in the presence of natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds α4β1 and blocks its interaction with both ADAM28 and OPN, resulted in a reduction of Th17 cells. In addition, adding IL-10 to the co-cultures abrogated the increase in Th17 cells, potentially interfering with MS MSC inflammatory effect. Our results suggest that blocking ADAM-28 and OPN interaction with cognate receptors or increasing IL-10 reduces the proinflammatory potential of MSCs from people with MS. Similar approaches could be used in clinical MSC treatments.

[PMID: 40815351] Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.

[PMID: 40804697] Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have multiple potent functions in cancer representing important therapeutic targets. MS4A4A is a functional TAM marker with controversial implications for prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the association between MS4A4A<sup>+</sup> TAM infiltration and clinical outcomes in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), as well as their impact on the immune landscape. A total of 400 UCB patients from cohorts at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify MS4A4A<sup>+</sup> TAMs and assess their spatial distribution alongside various immune components, evaluate the benefit of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy, and analyze survival outcomes. Additionally, matched UCB tissues were examined before and after recurrence or progression. We observed that MS4A4A<sup>+</sup> TAMs were present at higher levels in the stromal region compared to the intratumoral region, and correlated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis in both regions. No significant difference was observed in the number of MS4A4A<sup>+</sup> TAMs before and after recurrence/progression in the same patient. Stromal MS4A4A<sup>+</sup> TAMs were negatively correlated with BCG efficacy and recurrence-free survival. These TAMs were positively associated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells, immune checkpoints (PD-1, LAG-3, HAVcr-2, TIGIT), and anti-inflammatory molecules (TGF-β1, IL-4) in the same respective regions. Additionally, MS4A4A<sup>+</sup> TAMs expressed high levels of TGF-β1 and HAVcr-2 in UCB tissues. In vitro, IL-4 induced MS4A4A expression in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, while Ms4a4a knockdown reduced the anti-inflammatory molecule Arg1 and increased pro-inflammatory molecule Nos2 expression. These findings demonstrate that MS4A4A is a reliable prognostic marker and predictor of BCG response in UCB, highlighting its role in shaping the immune landscape and immunotherapy outcomes. © 2025 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.",10

PfHT1 transports the hexose sugar to meet the energy demand of the parasite. Studying the mechanism of transport and designing structure specific inhibitors against PfHT1 is an intelligent strategy to kill malaria parasite by starving it out because at the blood stage the sole carbon source of Plasmodium falciparum is glucose. In this study the conformational dynamics of PfHT1 has been studied in detail in the apo and holo (inhibitor bound) form using Molecular Dynamics Simulation, which reveals that PfHT1 undergoes ligand induced closed state if compared with the apo form. The geometry of ligand binding pocket also shifts from the apo form in the presence of inhibitors. The lead molecules were obtained from screening nearly 4500 compounds. A de novo drug designing approach based on the skeleton of the leads, has produced inhibitors of PfHT1 with higher specificity and affinity. The drug screening data as well as the conformational dynamics study was validated using Molecular Dynamics Simulation. In simulation a near physiological environment was created for PfHT1 by constructing a lipid phase (phospholipid bilayer) sandwiched between aqueous phases (mimics extracellular and cytosolic polar environment).

[PMID: 41185626] Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to endothelial injury in vascular diseases and interventions. While mitochondrial transplantation offers a promising therapeutic strategy, current approaches lack target specificity, efficient uptake, and long-term retention. This study presents a surface-engineering approach to enhance mitochondria delivery to the vascular endothelium as a step toward novel endothelial repair strategies. Mitochondria were isolated from healthy induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPSC-MSCs) and surface functionalized with a phospholipid-based coating platform (DSPE-PEG) to enable peptide functionalization. DSPE-PEG was conjugated to either VCAM-1-binding peptide and collagen-binding peptide to enable targeting to dysfunctional and injured endothelium. Mitochondria particle characteristics were measured using flow cytometry, dynamic light scattering and Seahorse. Mitochondrial uptake, retention, and function were assessed in human diabetic aortic endothelial cells (DAECs) using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, JC-1 staining, and Seahorse metabolic analysis. iPSC-MSCs provided bioenergetically competent mitochondria suitable for therapeutic delivery. DSPE-PEG surface functionalization significantly enhanced mitochondrial uptake in DAECs, compared to uncoated mitochondria. Confocal imaging and quantitative analysis revealed increased cytoplasmic retention and greater colocalization with the endogenous mitochondrial network after 24 h. Functional assays demonstrated improved mitochondrial membrane potential and sustained oxygen consumption in recipient cells, indicating enhanced host mitochondrial function following treatment with surface-engineered mitochondria. This study establishes a proof-of-concept for mitochondria surface engineering to enhance mitochondria transplantation to damaged endothelium, demonstrating improved cellular uptake and bioenergetic restoration. These findings provide a foundation for developing adaptable, cell-free therapeutics for vascular disease. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12195-025-00862-1.

[PMID: 41184296] Influenza is a global health concern, causing over 300,000 deaths worldwide annually. Current vaccines and natural infection mainly elicit antibodies against the variable head domain of the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. While these antibodies are highly neutralizing, the head domain constantly mutates due to selective pressure, causing the immune response to be strain-specific. Targeting the conserved HA stalk domain, however, has been shown to be a promising approach for a broadly protective vaccine. We previously demonstrated that presenting HA in an inverted orientation on virus-like particles (VLPs) significantly enhanced the induction of stalk-directed, cross-reactive antibodies compared to HA presented in a regular orientation. Here, we evaluated the protective efficacy of the inverted HA vaccine (VLP-HA<sub>inv</sub>) in mice against homologous, heterologous, and heterosubtypic influenza A virus challenges. VLP-HA<sub>inv</sub> vaccination in mice provided complete protection against homologous and heterologous H1N1 challenges as well as partial protection against a heterosubtypic challenge with bovine H5N1.

[PMID: 41184252] The electron affinity (EA), the energy released when a neutral atom binds an additional electron, is a fundamental property of atoms that is governed by electron-electron correlations and is strongly related to an element's chemical reactivity. However, conventional techniques for EA determination lack the experimental sensitivity to probe very scarce samples. As a result, the EA for the heaviest elements of the periodic table is entirely uncharted. Here, we present a novel technique to determine EAs through Laser Photodetachment Threshold Spectroscopy, performed in an electrostatic ion beam trap to increase the samples' exposure to laser photons and, thus, improve the experimental signal sensitivity by three orders of magnitude. Moreover, the additional exposure time allows the use of lower-power continuous-wave narrow-band lasers that reduce uncertainties associated with broadening effects induced by the laser bandwidth. By applying this technique, we measure the EA of <sup>35</sup>Cl to be 3.612720(44) eV, achieving state-of-the-art precision while employing five orders of magnitude fewer anions. The demonstrated sensitivity paves the way for systematic EA measurements across isotopic chains - including isotope shifts and hyperfine splittings - and ultimately for the first direct determination of electron affinities in superheavy elements.

[PMID: 41180195] The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal axis (HPA/HPI) is the neuroendocrine axis which allows vertebrates to cope with changing environments <i>via</i> adaptative stress responses. Glucocorticoids (GC) are the main effectors of this corticotropic axis, and their plasma levels (free form) are elevated under stress conditions. In contrast, in normal conditions, in order to prevent their deleterious impact on tissues, GC are found bound to a binding protein, the corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG). This protein, also called transcortin, was discovered in the 1950s, and later shown to be part of the SERPIN family (SERPINA6). Most vertebrates present high levels of bound GC, but some exceptions exist such as lamprey, flying squirrel or New World monkey. In birds, CBG is reported to be the substitute for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) as well since they lack <i>shbg</i> gene. In amphibians, CBG binds GC and sex steroids with equivalty -50ently high affinity. In teleosts, up to now, no CBG has been characterized. Mainly synthetized by the liver, the CBG is released in the blood where it serves as a GC transporter and address them to the sites of inflammation and infection. Evidences accumulate to propose CBG as also a GC reservoir. Other functions, under-characterized for the moment, have also been reported for the CBG: extrahepatic CBG could prevent the GC to bind to their receptor(s) intracellularly, and circulating CBG-GC complex could bind to a receptor which allows its internalization in target cells by endocytosis. The concentrations of the plasma CBG show natural physiological variations during specific life-history stages such as during pregnancy and hibernation in mammals, or breeding season in birds. Vertebrates may also present fluctuating CBG when experiencing extreme conditions leading to food deprivation for example. CBG knockout in mice and mutations in human stressed out the functional importance of CBG. In human, a CBG deficit is associated with a number of patho-physiologies including endocrine diseases (hypo- or hyper-thyroidism, obesity) and pro-inflammatory pathologies (sepsis, burning). Our review begins by a description of CBG discovery, characterization and measurement in vertebrates. A focus on the variations of CBG concentrations in various physiological conditions or under non-natural situations in vertebrates follows. The current knowledge on the different functions reported for CBG is then unfold. Our review ends with CBG pathological alterations observed in human to evidence how this protein could have therapeutic uses.

[PMID: 41177463] Sustained serum levels of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are crucial for effective passive immunization against infectious diseases as protection persists only while these bnAbs remain at adequate concentrations within the body. Current obstacles, such as poor pharmacokinetics (PK) and burdensome administration, must be overcome to make bnAbs a viable option for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. In this work, we explore how a polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel depot technology can be engineered to prolong protein delivery and enable drug exposure on the order of weeks to months. In-vivo studies in mice and rats demonstrate extended protein release compared to bolus administration, and modeling efforts predict the impact of both the elimination half-life of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and hydrogel depot volume on overall pharmacokinetics. Moreover, flow cytometry characterization reveals that immune cell infiltration into the hydrogel depot can result in faster-than-expected release of antibody cargo on account of active transport via cellular uptake. We then demonstrate that co-formulation of antibodies with an anti-inflammatory agent reduces cellular infiltration and resulting active transport, further extending delivery and pharmacokinetics. Finally, multicompartmental modeling predicts the human PK profiles of clinically relevant HIV bnAbs delivered via subcutaneous hydrogel injection. These findings aid in the development of next generation hydrogel materials that stabilize and slowly release bnAbs for long-term pre-exposure immunoprophylaxis.

[PMID: 41174305] Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are characterized by structural mobility and lack of stable tertiary structure. These are important for IDP functions and interactions with other protein partners. IDP binding modes are distinctly divergent from globular protein-protein interactions. Comprehensive studies on effects of mutations in this structurally distinct protein class of IDPs are limited, impeding the development of accurate prediction methods for mutational effects in IDPs. Understanding how mutations affect IDP binding affinity is also crucial to peptide drug design, therapeutics engineering, and research on IDP diseases. Previous deep mutational scanning study of intrinsically disordered domain of control of cell death protein A (CcdA) shed light on residue-specific contribution to cognate partner binding energetics and outlined methodology for building IDP-compatible prediction models of binding affinity. The current chapter summarizes our previously described methodology [1] (see Notes 1, 4-7) for development of a linear regression-based predictive model, Intrinsically disordered Protein Affinity prediction (IPApred). Our method incorporates structural information at the residue level as well as experimentally derived mutational penalties while leveraging the distinct physicochemical properties of different amino acids to predict how single-site substitutions affect partner binding in IDPs. We describe methods for data generation and collection, and the steps of selecting features, training a simple mathematical model, outlining a protocol for using IPApred, and finally discussing validation and evaluation of the model. The chapter also highlights current limitations of the model and challenges faced in modeling IDP energetics and discusses possible strategies of addressing them. Despite drawbacks, IPApred provides a useful framework for predicting mutational effects in disordered proteins and for improved understanding of related biological processes and disease mechanisms.

[PMID: 41174039] Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective in treating several advanced cancers, but these treatments have had limited success in metastatic ovarian cancer. Here we engineered liposomal nanoparticles carrying a poly-ʟ-arginine/poly-ʟ-glutamate coating that promotes their binding and retention on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. Covalent anchoring of the potent immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) to phospholipid headgroups of the liposome core enabled the polymer-coated particles to concentrate IL-12 in disseminated ovarian cancer tumours following intraperitoneal administration. Shedding of the layer-by-layer coating and serum-protein-mediated extraction of IL-12-conjugated lipids from the liposomal core over time enabled IL-12 to disseminate in the tumour bed following rapid nanoparticle localization in tumour nodules. Optimized IL-12-polymer-coated nanoparticles promoted robust T cell accumulation in ascites and tumours in mouse models, extending survival compared with free IL-12 and sensitizing tumours to immune checkpoint inhibitors, eliciting strong immune responses and immune memory. Overall, these findings support the potential of these polymer-coated nanoparticles for the sustained delivery of IL-12 to disseminated metastatic ovarian cancer.

[PMID: 41173933] Despite significant progress in global HIV prevention, adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa remain disproportionately affected, with high rates of new infections persisting. This study explored the acceptability of subcutaneously administered broadly neutralising antibodies, receiving either one or two doses of VRC07-523LS and/or PGT121, from the perspective of women living without HIV in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This qualitative sub-study explored the motivational, capability, and opportunity factors influencing product acceptability through in-depth interviews with 26 of the 45 participants aged 18-45 years who participated in the CAPRISA 012A Phase 1 trial. Thematic analysis guided by the COM-B Model and Theoretical Framework of Acceptability were used to explore the acceptability of products. Clear communication about potential side effects, study coherence and product attributes such as longer-acting, injectable delivery facilitate high acceptability. External factors including lack of social support and fear of stigma affected decision-making, with intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy beliefs about using the product emerging as critical determinants of product use. While most participants disclosed study participation to partners and family, partner influence varied; participants reported having the product administered based on personal health concerns regardless of partner support. Access to additional sexual and reproductive health services through study participation further enhanced acceptability of study product. The findings underscore the importance of integrating clear messaging on product efficacy, linking potential HIV prevention products to broader healthcare services, and supporting different users to make the decision to use this product. This study provides a novel contribution to understanding the complex dynamics of acceptability and behaviour change, essential for successful implementation and uptake of HIV prevention strategies.

[PMID: 41172968] Gram-negative bacteria feature an asymmetric outer membrane, composed of phospholipids in the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or lipooligosaccharides (LOS) in the outer leaflet, which underpins virulence and antibiotic resistance. Conventional LPS assays like the Limulus amebocyte lysate test face ethical and practical challenges, motivating the development of aptamer-based detection. Here, we probe the interaction of the LA27 DNA aptamer (Kd ≈ 46 nM) with biomimetic membranes incorporating LOS/LPS from Akkermansia muciniphila, Flavobacterium sp. Root935, and Paenalcaligenes hominis strains. Asymmetric supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) and symmetric large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were characterized by neutron reflectometry (NR), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). NR confirmed preserved bilayer asymmetry and revealed that LA27 deeply penetrates Akkermansia LOS bilayers, evidenced by increased core hydration and structural disruption, whereas interactions with Flavobacterium LOS are moderate, and those with Paenalcaligenes LPS are confined to surface adhesion due to extensive LPS O-antigen chains. SANS and DLS of LUVs corroborated these modes: Akkermansia vesicles showed negligible changes in lamellar thickness and hydrodynamic radius, consistent with insertion, while those containing Flavobacterium LOS and Paenalcaligenes LPS exhibited significant increases in both size-related metrics, indicative of surface binding for those latter cases. These results elucidate how polysaccharide composition and supramolecular architecture of LOS/LPS govern aptamer affinity and specificity, providing a rigorous framework for nano-bio interface studies and laying the groundwork for selective, aptamer-based endotoxin sensing platforms.",10

In this study, a nanozyme-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor was developed through a triple signal amplification strategy. A hollow-structured h-CdS coupled with TiO<sub>2</sub> formed a highly efficient heterojunction that enhanced light absorption, light scattering, and charge separation, resulting in significantly improved photoelectric conversion efficiency. A single-atom Fe-MNC nanozyme possessing both peroxidase- and oxidase-like activities was synthesized via a cascade anchoring strategy, successfully catalyzing a biocatalytic precipitation (BCP) reaction for signal amplification. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validated the energy band structure of the heterojunction and the catalytic superiority of Fe-MNC. Additionally, a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) was rationally designed based on the AFB1 aptamer to achieve target-specific recognition and probe amplification. By integrating these three synergistic elements, the constructed nanozyme-based PEC aptasensor enabled highly sensitive detection of AFB1 with a detection limit of 2.04 fg/mL and a linear range from 0.005 to 100 pg/mL. The sensor demonstrated excellent stability and selectivity and showed good agreement with HPLC results when applied to real sample analysis, highlighting its practical potential for food safety monitoring.

[PMID: 41186974] Obesity is characterized by a proinflammatory condition contributing to poor outcomes, but its association with autoimmunity is inconclusive. To fill this gap in knowledge, we searched PubMed and Embase for studies analyzing the association between obesity and the prevalence and/or incidence of autoimmune diseases. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI relating to the prevalence or incidence of autoimmune diseases in people with BMI > 30, compared to BMI < 25, were pooled using generic inverse variance and fixed effect models. Of 1,311 records, 26 (8 cross-sectional and 18 longitudinal) studies were included in the meta-analysis. Obesity, compared with normal weight, was associated with increased prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis (OR = 1.11 [1.06, 1.16], p < 0.00001; OR = 1.35 [1.14, 1.59], p = 0.0004, respectively) and increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (HR = 1.30 [1.15, 1.49], p < 0.0001), psoriasis (HR = 1.18 [1.16, 1.20], p < 0.00001), multiple sclerosis (HR = 1.49 [1.25, 1.77], p < 0.00001), and Crohn's/ulcerative colitis (HR = 1.35 [1.11, 1.65], p < 0.003). Obesity was also significantly associated with incidence of any autoimmune disease (HR = 1.41 [1.24, 1.62], p < 0.00001). Although definitive conclusions are still precluded for the single diseases, overall evidence supports obesity as a risk factor for autoimmunity.

[PMID: 41186964] Sustainable, autonomous, adaptive, and next generation flexible electronic systems inside Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable devices have resulted in innovative advancements in energy harvesting technologies. Despite the existence of numerous energy harvesting technologies, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as a potential option for powering smart and compact electronic devices. This study focuses on the fabrication of high-performance TENGs composed of a composite layer with SrBi<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>15</sub> (SBTO) embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and a biocompatible, natural pectin polymer layer. Utilizing the synergistic dielectric enhancement of SBTO, a lead-free Aurivillius-type perovskite, and the charge-accumulative characteristics of pectin, the TENG achieved exceptional electrical performance, with an output voltage reaching 375.7 V, an output current of 20.8 μA and a power density of 12.5 W m<sup>-2</sup> under optimal conditions. An optimal filler concentration of 7 wt% and an operating frequency of 5 Hz produced maximum charge transfer efficiency. The engineered devices exhibited exceptional mechanical durability (>10 000 cycles), environmental stability (>30 days), and humidity resistance (45-90% R.H) when encapsulated. Moreover, incorporating TENGs into autonomous fire alarm systems substantiates their real-time sensing and notification capabilities <i>via</i> the integration of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules that function without batteries. The developed system delivers prompt, location-specific alerts <i>via</i> human-initiated activation, even during emergencies. This work demonstrates the scalable design of flexible TENGs, offering a unique alternative for autonomous fire detection in off-grid or high-risk environments.

Newborn SD rats were randomized into two control groups (C1 exposed to 21% O₂ for 2 weeks; C2 exposed to 21% O₂ for 3 weeks), and three exposure groups (H1 exposed to 75% O₂ for 2 weeks; H2 exposed to 75% O₂ for 2 weeks and then to 10% O₂ for a week; H3 exposed to 75% O₂ for 2 weeks and then to normoxia for a week). Cardiopulmonary parameters were evaluated by echocardiography, right ventricular systolic pressure measurement, histology, and α-SMA immunofluorescence. H1 and H2 groups exhibited distinct phenotypes, with those in the H2 group showing more severe phenotypes. The H2 group exhibited a 142% increase in RVSP relative to those in the C2 group. The right-heart index (RI) was 0.43 ± 0.01 in the H2 group, 0.36 ± 0.02 in the H3 group, and 0.22 ± 0.03 in the C2 group. Pulmonary vascular remodeling was significantly increased in the H2 group compared to the control and H3 groups. The H2 group uniquely replicated the disease process, with alveolar simplification preceding hypoxia-induced vascular thickening. The sequential hyperoxic hypoxia model dynamically mimicked the clinical progression of BPD-PH, which may provide a powerful platform for stage-specific mechanism research and development of novel therapeutic strategies.

[PMID: 41186846] Metabolic Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) algorithms have become invaluable tools for exploring deep into the complex dynamics of cellular metabolism. Monitoring subcellular parameters is of interest, particularly during photodynamic therapy (PDT), to enhance treatment efficacy. By joining together Metabolic FLIM with PLIM, it is possible to evaluate cellular metabolic states, such as oxygen consumption, redox states, pH levels, and energy production pathways. The aim of this work is to use NADH FLIM and PLIM techniques to distinguish different metabolic pattern signatures in tumor and normal cell lines using a PLIM pH sensitive complex from the family of phosphorescent [(N^C)<sub>2</sub>Ir(N^N)]<sup>+</sup> complexes. This investigation used a combination of 2-photon (2P) excited FLIM and PLIM techniques, coupled with time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) detection. All the data were collected from living cells and were analyzed through exponential fitting. For the pattern segmentation we have used the phasor plot approach. By constructing a calibration curve and simultaneously acquiring NADH-FLIM and PLIM data from our pH sensor, we were able to identify metabolic regions and distinguished different pattern signatures in tumor and normal cell lines. This combined approach provides a comprehensive view of the tumor microenvironment, offering critical insights into parameters that influence photosensitizer localization, ROS generation, and therapeutic response. By identifying metabolic and pH heterogeneity at the single-cell level, this method contributes to improving the selectivity, precision, and overall efficacy of PDT treatments.

[PMID: 41186834] Evolution has optimized proteins over time by the incorporation of precise and context-specific amino acid substitutions adapted to structural and functional demands. We have reconceptualized this principle using deep learning to engineer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting immune checkpoints PD-1 and LAG-3. These two checkpoints are targeted synergistically in combination immunotherapy to minimize cancer cell evasion. From the established antibodies, the best set was selected based on their clinical validation. These served as templates to improve binding affinity and therapeutic potential in the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. To guide antibody design, we formulated inverse modeling pipeline using message passing graph neural network for protein sequence design given a fixed backbone structure. This led to the prediction of functionally viable substitutions at the receptor-antibody interface. Resulting variant models were filtered based on physicochemical accuracy, evolutionary feasibility, empirical validation, geometric complementarity and machine learning guided mutation prediction, ensuring structural integrity and enhanced performance. In addition, thermostability and immunogenicity analyses of the filtered ones were carried out. Ultimately, the top candidates were subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations leading to post simulation trajectory analysis including stability, interaction and energy decomposition analysis. After a robust computational evaluation, seven variants exhibited improved network stability and superior binding as compared to their respective references. Moreover, we have also added negative control to reinforce the novelty and importance of our framework. Our results establish a robust and scalable framework to design ICIs and underscores potential leads having improved binding, concertedly targeting PD-1 and LAG-3, paving the path for next-generation immunotherapy.

[PMID: 41186828] Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have attracted significant attention in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment. However, the acquired or de novo PARP inhibitor resistance limits treatment success. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) regulates genome integrity, and thus, the aberrant activation of ATR could play a significant role in the pathogenesis of TNBC and be associated with PARPi resistance in especially homologous recombinant deficiency tumors. We aimed to assess the efficacy of ATR and PARP inhibitors combination in TNBC cells and the reversal of PARPi resistance in resistant cells. HCC1937 and HCC1937-R Talazoparib (TAL) resistant cells were treated with Elimusertib (ELI) alone as ATR inhibitor (ATRi) and ELI and TAL combination. Then, the cytotoxic, apoptotic and ATR based DNA damage response (DDR) were evaluated by WST-1, Annexin V, AO/PI, cell cycle and western blot analysis. Our results showed that the ELI and TAL combination could overcome TAL resistance by downregulating cell cycle checkpoint proteins and ATR-based DDR pathways through synergistic effects (ZIP score > 10). The overexpression of ATR and associated cell cycle proteins could play a role in PARPi resistance. However, this combination did not exert synergism in TNBC cells despite a higher apoptotic rate and increased DNA damage compared with the drug alone. Therefore, the dual targeting of ATR and PARP is a promising modality to reverse PARPi resistance with the downregulation of ATR-Chk1 based DNA damage response. However, further preclinical and clinical investigations should be required to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms behind ATRi and PARPi interactions in TNBC cells.

[PMID: 41186747] Improving the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) pathway in facultative anaerobic bacteria has important implications for efficient succinic acid (SA) production. With respective to enhance SA production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates via improving the rTCA pathway of Klebsiella oxytoca, the overexpression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) genes coupling with supplementation of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) were performed. The optimal concentrations of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation for wild (WT) and engineered (RT-pck, RT-ca.) strains were determined to be 3 g/L, 1 g/L and 4 g/L, respectively. The SA production achieved by RT-pck and RT-ca. strains with respective optimal NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation reached 28.00 ± 0.33 g/L and 29.82 ± 0.35 g/L at 72 h of fermentation, resulting in the peak PCK enzyme and CA enzyme activities of 76.52 ± 6.36 pmol/(min·10<sup>4</sup> cells) and 47.06 ± 8.99 pmol/(min·10<sup>4</sup> cells), separately, as well as upregulation of several genes associated with the rTCA pathway. These findings elucidate the synergistic mechanism of pck/ca. gene overexpression and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation in improving the rTCA pathway to enhance SA production. Overall, this study provides an effective strategy for improving lignocellulosic hydrolysate-based SA production, offering promising applications in lignocellulosic biorefinery and bioproduct process.",10

Food-specific IgG testing has been explored in various inflammatory conditions, but its relevance to lipedema remains unknown. Objective The objective of this study is to characterize IgG food sensitivity profiles in women with lipedema and investigate the paradoxical relationship between increased food reactivity and reduced total IgG antibody levels. Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 234 participants: women with lipedema (n=80), women without lipedema (n=74), and men (n=80). All had undergone IgG testing against 222 food antigens via ELISA. We analyzed qualitative (positive/negative) and quantitative IgG reactivity, applied dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) and clustering, and developed a multivariable logistic regression model to assess diagnostic performance. Results Women with lipedema exhibited a non-significantly higher number of positive IgG food reactions (14.8 vs 12.6; <i>p</i>=0.186), despite significantly lower total IgG levels (1747.1 vs 2974.8 AU; <i>p</i><0.001). This paradox was consistent across 79.7% of tested antigens. The most discriminative foods included wild game meats and certain vegetables. A combined IgG-based model achieved an area under the curve of 0.804, outperforming individual IgG metrics. Dimensionality reduction revealed no clear clustering based on reactivity patterns alone. Conclusion Lipedema displays a paradoxical IgG signature, more frequent positives despite lower total IgG, consistent with mucosal immune dysregulation (e.g., increased intestinal permeability, immune exhaustion, or dietary monotony). Single IgG metrics had limited discrimination, but a combined score improved classification, supporting IgG profiling as a complementary, not standalone, biomarker for patient stratification and personalized dietary guidance. Collectively, these findings suggest that the adipose phenotype may be downstream of broader systemic processes; prospective studies should assess IgG subclasses, barrier markers (e.g., zonulin), and gluten-modulated interventions.

[PMID: 41184309] Current electrode technologies are too rigid for safe and effective delivery of electrotherapy in the brain, and patients with glioblastoma continue to face a devastating prognosis, with median survival stalled at 15 months despite intensive treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. But these conventional approaches potentially compromise immune function, underscoring the urgent need for therapies that activate, rather than suppress, the immune system. Therefore, we introduce injectable conductive hydrogels engineered to match the softness of brain tissue while exhibiting electrical conductivities up to three orders of magnitude higher than any previously reported injectable hydrogels. They can be implanted through minimally invasive syringe capillaries as narrow as 30 µm-avoiding brain tissue damage-and via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) or endovascular catheters, the latter potentially eliminating the need for open brain surgery. Additionally, it can drape a resection cavity to eliminate residual tumor cells. In human glioblastoma tumors in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane model, implantation of the electrode using CED, followed by irreversible electroporation, obliterated tumors within three days. Other injection techniques impaired tumor growth, induced immunogenic cell death, and a robust infiltration of helper and cytotoxic T cells, alongside macrophages, highlighting the immune-activating and tumor-targeting capabilities.

[PMID: 41184307] DNA repair mechanisms in human primary cells, including error-free repair, and, recurrent nuclease cleavage events, remain largely uncharacterised. We elucidate gene-editing related repair processes using Cleavage and Lesion Evaluation via Absolute Real-time dPCR (CLEAR-time dPCR), an ensemble of multiplexed dPCR assays that quantifies genome integrity at targeted sites. Utilising CLEAR-time dPCR we track active DSBs, small indels, large deletions, and other aberrations in absolute terms in clinically relevant edited cells, including HSPCs, iPSCs, and T-cells. By quantifying up to 90% of loci with unresolved DSBs, CLEAR-time dPCR reveals biases inherent to conventional mutation screening assays. Furthermore, we accurately quantify DNA repair precision, revealing prevalent scarless repair after blunt and staggered end DSBs and recurrent nucleases cleavage. This work provides one of the most precise analyses of DNA repair and mutation dynamics, paving the way for mechanistic studies to advance gene therapy, designer editors, and small molecule discovery.

[PMID: 41184129] Effector T cells are central to immune defense against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>), exerting complex and multifaceted roles that contribute to both protection and immunopathology. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activate macrophages, maintain granulomas, and coordinate broad immune functions through diverse subsets, including cytokine-producing, cytotoxic, and regulatory cells. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells target infected cells through cytolytic activity and cytokine secretion, while unconventional T cells provide rapid, innate-like responses, particularly at mucosal sites. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics have revealed heterogeneity, functional plasticity, and spatial compartmentalization among T-cell subsets. Tissue-resident memory T cells in the lung parenchyma have emerged as key predictors of protective immunity. These insights are reshaping our understanding of T-cell-mediated control of <i>Mtb</i> and highlight the limitations of interferon (IFN)-γ-centric vaccine strategies. Future strategies must aim to elicit a broader range of T-cell responses, promote effective tissue localization, enhance polyfunctionality, and overcome regulatory or exhaustion-associated dysfunctions.

[PMID: 41183190] Cancer cells comprise a significant proportion of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and often have compromised expression or repression of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which prevents effective stimulation of interferon genes (STING) signaling. Here, we leverage the cancer cells and hijack their cellular machinery for increased production of cGAMP, differing from conventional strategies whereby synthetic STING agonists are delivered to immune cells in the TME as a bolus dose, are rapidly cleared and can cause systemic toxicity. Increasing evidence suggests that cGAMP derived from cancer cells can act on proximal immune cells, activating STING, contributing to an antitumor immune response. We used lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver mRNA coding for cGAS which catalyzes the production of cGAMP. We observed dramatic increases in extracellular and intracellular cGAMP when cancer cells were transfected with cGAS mRNA and genomic DNA, the substrate for cGAS. We confirmed that cGAS and cGAMP are functional due to activation of immune cells, through a combination of extracellular transfer and cell-cell contact mechanisms. Treatment of syngeneic murine melanoma with cGAS LNPs reduced tumor growth significantly and further benefit was observed upon combination with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1). Moreover, we found increased activation in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells in the TME post treatment with cGAS LNPs. These findings highlight how cancer cells can be used to actively contribute to their own elimination and may be a broadly applicable strategy for delivery of other reprogramming molecules to cancer cells and wider therapeutic combinations.

[PMID: 41182665] Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year (31% of all global deaths). Cardiovascular aging (CVA) not only contributes to the aging of other organ systems, leading to systemic aging in individuals, but also induces CVDs that impose serious health challenges and exacerbate CVA. Notably, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs have emerged as key players in CVA and associated CVDs (AR-CVDs) by acting as pro-aging, anti-aging, or dual-regulating ncRNAs. They influence both vascular aging and cardiac aging processes through modulating pro-aging or anti-aging substrates and triggers, leading to cellular senescence and CVA-related phenotypes and associated pathological processes, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and arrhythmias. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of ncRNAs in CVA and AR-CVDs, focusing on the published studies that utilize in vitro and in vivo models of aging and aging-related cardiovascular pathophysiological processes. It does not aim to exhaustively cover all ncRNA studies unrelated to aging but to present a more holistic and integrated perspective on the diverse roles of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs in the context of CVA and AR-CVDs. In doing so, we will explore both shared and unique aspects of ncRNAs from various angles, shedding light on their regulatory roles in CVA and AR-CVDs, which may offer insights into the current state and future directions of the field. By integrating recent findings and ongoing research, this review seeks to elucidate the intricate network of ncRNAs in CVA and AR-CVDs, paving the way for novel approaches to combat one of the most pressing health challenges of our time.

[PMID: 41182434] CD40 is a T-cell co-stimulatory receptor targeted by next-generation immunotherapies. We conducted a pan-cancer transcriptome analysis of CD40, its ligand, and related immune markers to evaluate co-expression patterns and clinical outcomes. We analyzed transcriptome data for CD40, its ligand, and other common checkpoints and co-stimulators (PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4, LAG-3, ICOS, CD27, CD28, OX40, and GITR). RNA expression was classified as high (75-100th percentile), moderate (25-74th), or low (0-24th) against a reference population of 735 previously tested solid tumors. Of 514 patients, 114 (22%) showed high, 247 (48%) moderate, and 153 (30%) low CD40 RNA expression. High CD40 expression was most frequent in liver and bile duct (42%), pancreatic (42%), and ovarian (40%) cancers. Both high CD40 and low-moderate CD40 ligand expression-potentially conducive to CD40 agonist therapy-was most frequent in ovarian (33%) and pancreatic (24%) cancer. In both UCSD (N = 514) and TCGA (N = 10,953) cohorts, high CD40 expression significantly correlated with high CD28 and GITR. High CD40 RNA levels were not prognostic for overall survival (OS) from metastatic disease (P = 0.2) (n = 272 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-naïve patients). High CD40 expression correlated with longer OS from immunotherapy initiation (n = 217 ICI-treated patients; P = 0.04, univariable analysis), but not multivariable analysis, suggesting it may not be an independent predictive biomarker. High CD40 expression correlated with liver and bile duct, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers, as well as with CD28 and GITR transcripts. Immune marker co-expression in individual patients merits further exploration for the development of CD40-based and other immunotherapy interventions.

[PMID: 41182407] While mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancers (CRCs) exhibit strong immunogenicity and better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, the more prevalent mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) CRCs typically show poor T- cell infiltration and inferior outcomes. Profiling the limited tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells helps identify responders and guides new strategies to enhance their infiltration and function in pMMR CRC tumors. Our study reveals that the proportion and number of CD103<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T (CD103N) cells are significantly increased in pMMR CRC tissue compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue. Distinguish from CD103<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T (CD103P) cells with elevated T<sub>EX</sub> markers, these CD103N cells display a precursor exhausted T cells (T<sub>PEX</sub>) phenotype with elevated stemness properties, reduced exhaustion markers, and retained functional capacity to secrete anti-tumor mediators. Moreover, CD103N cells in pMMR CRC shared a substantial number of identical TCR clonotypes with both CD103P cells in tumor and CD103N cell in peripheral blood. In dMMR CRC patients, enrichment of T<sub>PEX</sub>-like CD103N cells is associated with a favorable prognosis following anti-PD-1 therapy, suggesting their association with clinical outcome. Our findings identify an expanded population of CD103N cells exhibiting a T<sub>PEX</sub> phenotype with anti-tumor potential in pMMR CRC, highlighting their promise as therapeutic targets for recruitment into the tumor microenvironment to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.

[PMID: 41181122] Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage, where conventional chemoradiotherapy offers only limited clinical benefit. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) have demonstrated substantial therapeutic potential; however, reliable biomarkers for predicting therapeutic outcomes remain unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing dataset for ESCC was obtained from the GEO database and analyzed using the Seurat R package to evaluate gene expression in tumor and adjacent tissues. Additionally, flow cytometry was used to assess immune cell subsets in peripheral blood samples from patients undergoing immunotherapy. Statistical analyses, including survival analysis and the Kruskal-Wallis test, were conducted to investigate the association between immune cell subsets and treatment efficacy. In tumor tissues, immune subsets were significantly enriched compared with adjacent tissues, including CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with exhaustion (CD39, TIM3, PD-1) or activation/tissue residency (CD137, CD103) features; CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with activation (CD134, CD137) or regulatory (FOXP3) phenotypes; and dendritic cells expressing TIM3 or CD103. In peripheral blood, a median change in TIM3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells of 3.35% was observed following immunotherapy. Patients with changes exceeding this threshold experienced shorter progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those with lower changes (5.0 vs. 8.5 months, P = 0.024). Furthermore, TIM3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell changes were markedly reduced in patients achieving complete or partial responses compared to those with progressive disease. TIM3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are a promising predictive biomarker for immunotherapy outcomes in ESCC. These findings highlight their potential to guide personalized treatment strategies in clinical practice.

[PMID: 41181090] The gut microbiome critically regulates antitumor immunity through its metabolic byproducts, which serve as pivotal mediators of host-microbe crosstalk in tumor immunotherapy. This review synthesizes cutting-edge evidence on how microbial metabolites-including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), tryptophan derivatives, and bile acids-reprogram immune cell dynamics and remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME). Mechanistically, metabolites such as butyrate and indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) enhance immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy by epigenetic modulation or metabolic reprogramming. Conversely, kynurenine (a tryptophan metabolite) and secondary bile acids drive resistance by polarizing macrophages toward an immunosuppressive phenotype or exhausting cytotoxic T cells. Metabolite-targeted interventions (such as probiotics, dietary modulation, and engineered microbes) show synergistic potential with ICIs, but require resolution of causal inference limitations, interindividual variability, tumor-context specificity, and dose optimization. Precision microbiome engineering, guided by multi-omics profiling and artificial intelligence, may unlock personalized strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance.",10

Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187216] Many taxa have independently evolved genetic sex determination where a single gene located on a sex chromosome controls gonadal differentiation. The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex-reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the ""Four Core Genotypes"" model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.

[PMID: 41187208] This study reports the first green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using an aqueous leaf extract of Brownlowia tersa (B. tersa), confirming their formation via UV-Vis spectrophotometry with a peak at 472 nm. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial and neuroprotective activities, particularly for Alzheimer's disease. GC-MS and FT-IR analyses identified phenolics and flavonoids as the capping and reducing agents in the synthesis process. FESEM imaging showed nanoparticles of varied shapes and sizes, while EDX analysis confirmed the presence of silver, oxygen, and carbon. The antimicrobial activity was demonstrated with inhibition zones ranging from 8.5 to 10.5 mm against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 100 and 200 μg/disc, compared to control, deionised water. In antioxidant assays, AgNPs exhibited an IC₅₀ of 1533.448 μg/ml, significantly higher than L-ascorbic acid (IC₅₀: 83.948 μg/ml) and the plant extract (IC₅₀: 254.438 μg/ml), indicating weaker antioxidant properties of AgNPs. The cytotoxicity of the AgNPs was assessed using the brine shrimp lethality test, yielding LC₅₀ value of 13.50 μg/ml, indicating moderate toxicity. Neuropharmacological tests, except the elevated plus maze, on swiss albino mice revealed significant anxiolytic effects (p < 0.05) and enhanced locomotor activity. Molecular docking studies of bioactive compounds from B. tersa leaves with Alzheimer's and bacterial infection-related proteins revealed binding energies from -7.7 to -5.2 kcal/mol, with Benzamide, N-ethyl-N-[(4-ethylaminophenyl) sulfonyl]- and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol showing the strongest affinities. While the results are promising, the study acknowledges challenges in scaling up the synthesis process and emphasises the need for further research into the long-term biological effects and safety of AgNPs. Overall, B. tersa-derived AgNPs show great potential for therapeutic applications in bacterial infections and neurological disorders, but scalability and safety require more investigation.

[PMID: 41187206] Fast skeletal muscle fibers from zebrafish share a number of functional properties with mammalian twitch muscle fibers, making this vertebrate a precious model to investigate the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders. We previously reported that action potentials (APs) from zebrafish fast fibers exhibit low amplitude and require unusually strong negative resting membrane voltage levels to be elicited. In this study, using voltage-clamp and current-clamp techniques, we explored the properties of voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV) responsible for initiation and propagation of AP in isolated adult zebrafish fast skeletal muscle fibers and compared them to mouse fast-twitch muscle fibers using the same experimental conditions. We found that kinetics of activation and inactivation of NaV were faster in zebrafish fibers and, overall, that the voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted by 25 mV toward negative voltages as compared to mouse fibers, yielding a mean half-inactivation potential of -90 mV. In agreement with these findings, recording of APs at various resting membrane potentials indicated that APs vanished for resting membrane potentials less negative than -80 mV in zebrafish, whereas APs could still be elicited from resting membrane potentials as low as -60 mV in mice. In addition, Ca2+ transients induced by field stimulation were insensitive to Na+ current blockade in zebrafish but not in mouse fibers. Fluorescence labeling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors showed that zebrafish fast fibers were multi-innervated with a mean distance between extra-synaptic sarcolemma and motor endplates of 14 µm, expected to lead to negligible attenuation of depolarization propagated from endplates. Finally, knock out of the two genes encoding pore-forming NaV subunits in zebrafish muscles did not induce any change in locomotion and escape behavior of the animals. Taken together, these data question the role of NaV and the occurrence of APs in zebrafish fast muscle.

[PMID: 41187191] Severe viral and bacterial pneumonia are among the most common causes of death worldwide. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1)'s on methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)-induced severe pneumonia following cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. A young mouse model of severe pneumonia was established using Staphylococcus aureus and CMV. LTBP1 overexpression was induced, and pathological changes in lung tissue were assessed through H&E staining. Serum levels of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and interleukin (IL)-1β, were measured using ELISA. Bacterial load in the lungs was quantified, and protein expression levels of LTBP1, TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad3, and p-Smad3 in lung tissue were analyzed using Western blot. The LTBP1 expression was reduced in the young mouse model of severe pneumonia induced by Staphylococcus aureus after cytomegalovirus reactivation. Overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited lung damage, reduced serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and decreased bacterial load in the lungs. Additionally, overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. LTBP1 efficiently reduces severe pneumonia by activating the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating this condition.

[PMID: 41187170] Germ layer specification represents a critical transition where pluripotent cells acquire lineage-specific identities. We identify the maternal transcription factors Foxi2 and Sox3 to be pivotal master regulators of ectodermal germ layer specification in Xenopus. Ectopic co-expression of Foxi2 and Sox3 in prospective endodermal tissue induces the expression of ectodermal markers while suppressing mesendodermal markers. Transcriptomics analyses reveal that Foxi2 and Sox3 jointly and independently regulate hundreds of ectodermal target genes. During early cleavage stages, Foxi2 and Sox3 pre-bind to key cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), marking sites that later recruit Ep300 and facilitate H3K27ac deposition, thereby shaping the epigenetic landscape of the ectodermal genome. These CRMs are highly enriched within ectoderm-specific super-enhancers (SEs). Our findings highlight the pivotal role of ectodermal SE-associated CRMs in precise and robust ectodermal gene activation, establishing Foxi2 and Sox3 as central architects of ectodermal lineage specification.

[PMID: 41187159] Adolescent opioid use in the United States commands attention: millions of twelve- to nineteen-year-olds are exposed to opioids each year by prescription and misuse. Recent findings show that opioids bind not only to canonical opioid receptors but also interact with receptors on immune cells within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The potential for early life opioid exposure to give rise to long-term changes in the neuroimmune system is not fully understood, particularly given the adolescent brain's high susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that adolescent opioid use potentiates physiological and behavioral responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness later in life. To achieve this, we treated adolescent (postnatal day 35-42) male and female C57/BL6 mice with saline or bi-daily escalating doses of morphine for 5 days to model opioid dependence and, in adulthood (postnatal day 60-67), administered saline or a low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) to promote an immune response. Body weight, body surface temperature, and locomotor activity were recorded up to 48 hours after LPS administration. Mice were also tested in the forced swim test 52 hours after LPS administration to assess depressive-like behavior. In contrast to our hypotheses, we found that adolescent morphine exposure had no additive effect on low-dose LPS-induced sickness measures when assessed in adulthood. These data suggest that adolescent opioid exposure may have minimal effects on future immune challenges, although further research is needed to confirm this.",10

Histologically and developmentally distinct from white and beige adipocytes, BAT originates from a myogenic lineage and is characterised by a high mitochondrial density, multilocular lipid droplets, and abundant sympathetic innervation. Its defining function, non-shivering thermogenesis, is mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and complemented by alternative mechanisms such as futile creatine and calcium cycling. Beyond heat production, thermogenic fat is crucial in regulating whole-body metabolism. It contributes to glucose, lipid, and branched-chain amino acid homeostasis, and engages in endocrine and paracrine signalling through a rich secretome of batokines, lipid mediators, and extracellular vesicle-bound microRNAs. These signals orchestrate crosstalk with the liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and immune system, enhancing insulin sensitivity, vascularisation, and anti-inflammatory responses. Brown/Beige fat also exhibits notable anti-fibrotic properties and supports adipose tissue remodelling, maintaining structural and functional plasticity under metabolic stress. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of thermogenic adipose tissue biology, integrating its structural, developmental, and molecular features with its expanding physiological functions, highlighting its pivotal role in energy balance as well as its emerging therapeutic potential in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related metabolic disorders.

[PMID: 40380026] Adipose tissue thermogenesis has emerged as a prominent research focus for the treatment of metabolic diseases, particularly through mitochondrial uncoupling, which oxidizes nutrients to produce heat rather than synthesizing ATP. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) has garnered significant attention as a core protein mediating non-shivering thermogenesis(NST). However, recent studies indicate that energy dissipation can also occur via UCP1-independent thermogenesis, partially driven by futile metabolic cycles. These cycles involve ATP depletion coupled with reversible energy reactions, resulting in futile energy expenditure. Unlike classical UCP1-mediated thermogenesis, futile cycling is not confined to brown and beige adipose tissue, suggesting a broader range of therapeutic targets. These findings open new avenues for targeting these pathways to enhance metabolic health. This review explores the characteristics and distinctions of the primary metabolic organs (adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle) involved in the futile cycles of thermogenesis. It further elaborates on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying calcium, creatine, and lipid cycling, emphasizing their strengths, limitations, and roles beyond thermogenesis.

[PMID: 38928011] Adipose tissue is conventionally recognized as a metabolic organ responsible for storing energy. However, a proportion of adipose tissue also functions as a thermogenic organ, contributing to the inhibition of weight gain and prevention of metabolic diseases. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the study of thermogenic fats, particularly brown adipose tissue (BAT). Despite this progress, the mechanism underlying thermogenesis in beige adipose tissue remains highly controversial. It is widely acknowledged that beige adipose tissue has three additional thermogenic mechanisms in addition to the conventional UCP1-dependent thermogenesis: Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling thermogenesis, creatine substrate cycling thermogenesis, and triacylglycerol/fatty acid cycling thermogenesis. This paper delves into these three mechanisms and reviews the latest advancements in the molecular regulation of thermogenesis from the molecular genetic perspective. The objective of this review is to provide readers with a foundation of knowledge regarding the beige fats and a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of this process, which may lead to the development of new strategies for maintaining human health.

[PMID: 35791624] Brown and beige adipocytes produce heat and control systemic energy via non-shivering thermogenesis. Historically, thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes was thought to be exclusively through a mitochondria-localized protein, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). However, recent studies identified UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms in adipocytes. Importantly, UCP1-independent pathways significantly contribute to systemic energy and glucose homeostasis. The finding of UCP1-independent mechanisms provided new opportunities to target the pathways in vivo. In this review, we discuss the current understandings of thermogenic mechanisms in adipocytes with a focus on Ca2+ futile cycling.

[PMID: 32849287] Mammals have two types of thermogenic adipocytes: brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes. Thermogenic adipocytes express high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) to dissipates energy in the form of heat by uncoupling the mitochondrial proton gradient from mitochondrial respiration. There is much evidence that UCP1 is the center of BAT thermogenesis and systemic energy homeostasis. Recently, UCP1 independent thermogenic pathway identified in thermogenic adipocytes. Importantly, the thermogenic pathways are different in brown and beige adipocytes. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 2b calcium cycling mechanism is selective to beige adipocytes. It remains unknown how the multiple thermogenic mechanisms are coordinately regulated. The discovery of UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms potential offer new opportunities for improving obesity and type 2 diabetes particularly in groups such as elderly and obese populations who do not possess UCP1 positive adipocytes.

[PMID: 31116956] We are currently facing an ""obesity epidemic"" worldwide. Promoting inefficient metabolism in muscle represents a potential treatment for obesity and its complications. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) pumps in muscle are responsible for maintaining low cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration through the ATP-dependent pumping of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the SR lumen. SERCA activity has the potential to be a critical regulator of body mass and adiposity given that it is estimated to contribute upwards of 20% of daily energy expenditure. More interestingly, this fraction can be modified physiologically in the face of stressors, such as ambient temperature and diet, through its physical interaction with several regulators known to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and muscle function. In this review, we discuss advances in our understanding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cycling thermogenesis within skeletal muscle, focusing on SERCA and its protein regulators, which were thought previously to only modulate muscular contractility. <b>Novelty</b> ATP consumption by SERCA pumps comprises a large proportion of resting energy expenditure in muscle and is dynamically regulated through interactions with small SERCA regulatory proteins. SERCA efficiency correlates significantly with resting metabolism, such that individuals with a higher resting metabolic rate have less energetically efficient SERCA Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumping in muscle (i.e., lower coupling ratio). Futile Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling is a versatile heat generating mechanism utilized by both skeletal muscle and beige fat.

[PMID: 29703782] The balance between energy intake and energy expenditure establishes and preserves a 'set-point' body weight. The latter is comprised of three major components including metabolic rate, physical activity and thermogenesis. Thermogenesis is defined as the cellular dissipation of energy via heat production. This process has been extensively characterised in brown adipose tissue (BAT), wherein uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) creates a proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane, diverting protons away from ATP synthesis and resulting in heat dissipation. In beige adipocytes and skeletal muscle, thermogenesis can occur independent of UCP1. Beige adipocytes have been shown to produce heat via UCP1 as well as via both futile creatine and calcium cycling pathways. On the other hand, the UCP1 homologue UCP3 is abundant in skeletal muscle and post-prandial thermogenesis has been associated with UCP3 and the futile calcium cycling. This review will focus on the differential contributions of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in determining total thermogenic output and energy expenditure in large mammals. Sheep and pigs do not have a circumscribed brown fat depot but rather possess white fat depots that contain brown and beige adipocytes interspersed amongst white adipose tissue. This is representative of humans, where brown, beige and white adipocytes have been identified in the neck and supraclavicular regions. This review will describe the mechanisms of thermogenesis in pigs and sheep and the relative roles of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue thermogenesis in controlling body weight in larger mammals.

[PMID: 29320712] A new study in Nature Medicine, by Ikeda et al. (2017), reports that calcium cycling in beige adipocytes elevates energy expenditure and glucose oxidation in the absence of uncoupling protein 1. Thermogenic calcium cycling in beige fat is mediated by SERCA2b and improves cold tolerance and metabolic status.

[PMID: 29131158] Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) plays a central role in nonshivering thermogenesis in brown fat; however, its role in beige fat remains unclear. Here we report a robust UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism in beige fat that involves enhanced ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2). Inhibition of SERCA2b impairs UCP1-independent beige fat thermogenesis in humans and mice as well as in pigs, a species that lacks a functional UCP1 protein. Conversely, enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling by activation of α1- and/or β3-adrenergic receptors or the SERCA2b-RyR2 pathway stimulates UCP1-independent thermogenesis in beige adipocytes. In the absence of UCP1, beige fat dynamically expends glucose through enhanced glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid metabolism and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity for ATP-dependent thermogenesis through the SERCA2b pathway; beige fat thereby functions as a 'glucose sink' and improves glucose tolerance independently of body weight loss. Our study uncovers a noncanonical thermogenic mechanism through which beige fat controls whole-body energy homeostasis via Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling.

[PMID: 28547916] Currently, there is a significant percentage of the population who are or will be classified as obese, necessitating novel strategies to facilitate sustainable weight loss. Reductions in basal metabolic rate occur in the face of weight loss and pose formidable barriers to individuals attempting to sustain meaningful weight reductions. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which non-shivering thermogenesis may provide insight into metabolic pathways that can become druggable targets to facilitate sustainable weight loss. Specifically, we highlight the fact that non-shivering thermogenesis results in activation and expansion of brown and beige adipose tissues as well as activates pathways in skeletal muscle which increase metabolic flux and activity of muscle fibres through futile calcium cycling across the endoplasmic reticulum all facilitating an increase in metabolism. Finally, we highlight the fact there are sexual dimorphisms with respect to these metabolic processes in keeping with the National Institutes of Health mandate of treating sex as a biologic variable.",10

Among UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms, one involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling via SERCA2b in adipose tissue; however, the underlying molecular basis remains elusive. Here, we report that an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored peptide, C4orf3 (also known as another regulin [ALN]), uncouples SERCA2b Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport from its ATP hydrolysis, rendering the SERCA2b-C4orf3 complex exothermic. Loss of C4orf3/ALN improved the energetic efficiency of SERCA2b-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport without affecting SERCA2 expression, thereby reducing adipose tissue thermogenesis and increasing the adiposity of mice. Notably, genetic depletion of C4orf3 resulted in compensatory activation of UCP1-dependent thermogenesis following cold challenge. We demonstrated that genetic loss of both C4orf3 and Ucp1 additively impaired cold tolerance in vivo. Together, this study identifies C4orf3 as the molecular resistor to SERCA2b-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> import that plays a key role in UCP1-independent thermogenesis and energy balance.

[PMID: 37622342] Birds are endothermic homeotherms even though they lack the well-studied heat producing brown adipose tissue (BAT), found in several clades of eutherian mammals. Earlier studies in ducklings have demonstrated that skeletal muscle is the primary organ of nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) plausibly via futile calcium (Ca2+)-handling through ryanodine receptor (RyR) and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). However, recruitment of futile Ca2+-cycling in adult avian skeletal muscle has not been documented. Studies in mammals show remarkable mitochondrial remodeling concurrently with muscle NST during cold. Here, we wanted to define the mitochondrial and biochemical changes in the muscles in free-ranging adult birds and whether different skeletal muscle groups undergo similar seasonal changes. We analyzed four different muscles (pectoralis, biceps, triceps and iliotibialis) from local pigeon (Columba livia) collected during summer and winter seasons in two consecutive years. Remarkable increase in mitochondrial capacity was observed as evidenced from succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity staining in all the muscles. Interestingly, fibers with low SDH activity exhibited greater cross-sectional area during winter in all muscles except iliotibialis and became peripherally arranged in individual fascicles of pectoralis, which might indicate increased shivering. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that SERCA, sarcolipin and RyR are up-regulated to different levels in the muscles analyzed indicating muscle NST via futile Ca2+-cycling is recruited to varying degrees in winter. Moreover, proteins of mitochondrial-SR-tethering and biogenesis also showed differential alterations across the muscles. These data suggest that tropical winter (∼15°C) is sufficient to induce distinct remodeling across muscles in adult bird.

[PMID: 36948352] The activation of brown fat and induction of beige adipocytes, so-called non-shivering thermogenesis, is emerging as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in obesity management. Our previous report demonstrated that β-carotene (BC) induces beige adipocytes to increase UCP1-dependent thermogenic activity. However, the UCP1-independent thermogenic effect of BC on adipose tissues remains unexplored. In this study, we examined the effects of BC on UCP1-independent thermogenic activity with a focus on the ATP-consuming futile cycles in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. BC increased intracellular calcium levels and stimulated the expression of calcium cycling-related proteins, including sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) 2b, ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK2) in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes. In addition, BC stimulated thermogenesis by activating the creatine metabolism-related thermogenic pathway. Moreover, BC activated β-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1), which efficiently cleaved BC to retinal and consequently converted to its transcriptionally active form retinoic acid. These BC conversion products also exhibited thermogenic effects comparable to a similar level of BC. The mechanistic study revealed that retinal exhibited thermogenic activity independently of retinoic acid and retinoic acid-mediated thermogenesis was resulted partly from conversion of retinal. Moreover, BC activated α1-AR and UCP1-independent thermogenic effectors independently of UCP1 expression. In conclusion, the thermogenic response to BC and its conversion products in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes involves two interacting pathways, one mediated via β3-adrenergic receptors (β3-AR) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the other via α1-AR and increases in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels activated by calcium regulatory proteins.

[PMID: 36125552] Understanding temperature production and regulation in endotherm organisms becomes a crucial challenge facing the increased frequency and intensity of heat strokes related to global warming. Mitochondria, located at the crossroad of metabolism, respiration, Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, and apoptosis, were recently proposed to further act as cellular radiators, with an estimated inner temperature reaching 50 °C in common cell lines. This inner thermogenesis might be further exacerbated in organs devoted to produce consistent efforts as muscles, or heat as brown adipose tissue, in response to acute solicitations. Consequently, pathways promoting respiratory chain uncoupling and mitochondrial activity, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes, uncoupling proteins, futile cycling, and substrate supplies, provide the main processes controlling heat production and cell temperature. The mitochondrial thermogenesis might be further amplified by cytoplasmic mechanisms promoting the over-consumption of ATP pools. Considering these new thermic paradigms, we discuss here all conventional wisdoms linking mitochondrial functions to cellular thermogenesis in different physiological conditions.

[PMID: 35899483] Avian cold adaptation is hallmarked by innovative strategies of both heat conservation and thermogenesis. While minimizing heat loss can reduce the thermogenic demands of body temperature maintenance, it cannot eliminate the requirement for thermogenesis. Shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) are the two synergistic mechanisms contributing to endothermy. Birds are of particular interest in studies of NST as they lack brown adipose tissue (BAT), the major organ of NST in mammals. Critical analysis of the existing literature on avian strategies of cold adaptation suggests that skeletal muscle is the principal site of NST. Despite recent progress, isolating the mechanisms involved in avian muscle NST has been difficult as shivering and NST co-exist with its primary locomotory function. Herein, we re-evaluate various proposed molecular bases of avian skeletal muscle NST. Experimental evidence suggests that sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> -ATPase (SERCA) and ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) are key in avian muscle NST, through their mediation of futile Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling and thermogenesis. More recent studies have shown that SERCA regulation by sarcolipin (SLN) facilitates muscle NST in mammals; however, its role in birds is unclear. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in the muscle seems to be common to contraction, shivering and NST, but elucidating its roles will require more precise measurement of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels inside avian myofibres. The endocrine control of avian muscle NST is still poorly defined. A better understanding of the mechanistic details of avian muscle NST will provide insights into the roles of these processes in regulatory thermogenesis, which could further inform our understanding of the evolution of endothermy among vertebrates.

[PMID: 31928193] Thermogenesis in endotherms relies on both shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). The role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in NST is well recognized, but the role of muscle-based NST has been contested. However, recent studies have provided substantial evidence for the importance of muscle-based NST in mammals. This review focuses primarily on the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cycling in muscle NST; specifically, it will discuss recent data showing how uncoupling of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) (inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport but not ATP hydrolysis) by sarcolipin (SLN) results in futile SERCA pump activity, increased ATP hydrolysis and heat production contributing to muscle NST. It will also critically examine how activation of muscle NST can be an important factor in regulating metabolic rate and whole-body energy homeostasis. In this regard, SLN has emerged as a powerful signalling molecule to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in muscle. Furthermore, we will discuss the functional interplay between BAT and muscle, especially with respect to how reduced BAT function in mammals could be compensated by muscle-based NST. Based on the existing data, we argue that SLN-mediated thermogenesis is an integral part of muscle NST and that muscle NST potentially contributed to the evolution of endothermy within the vertebrate clade. This article is part of the theme issue 'Vertebrate palaeophysiology'.

[PMID: 31325458] Endothermy requires a source of endogenous heat production. In birds, this is derived primarily from shivering, but in mammals it is mostly non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized tissue found in Eutherian mammals that is the source of most NST. Heat production in BAT depends primarily on the activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which decouples transport of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane from synthesis of ATP. UCP1 and hence heat production of BAT is regulated by many factors. In this paper we discuss the main factors activating UCP1 and increasing heat production. Probably the most well-known activator is the catecholamine norepinephrine (NE) which is released from sympathetic nerve endings and binds to adrenergic receptors that are abundantly expressed on BAT. NE stimulates release of free-fatty acids. It was previously thought that such FFAs were essential for activation of UCP1. However recent work has suggested intracellular lipolysis is not essential and FFAs can be derived from extracellular sources. Thyroid hormones also exert impacts on metabolic rate via effects on brown adipocytes which express type 2 deiodinase. Knocking out DIO2 makes mice cold intolerant. Parathyroid hormone appears to also be a potent regulator of BAT activity and may be an important mediator of elevated expenditure during cancer cachexia, although this is disputed by observations that cachexia wasting is not blunted in UCP1 KO mice. Cardiac natriuretic peptides have also been implicated in regulating BAT thermogenesis and the interconversion of beige adipocytes from their white to brown form. Activation of BAT thermogenesis may be an important component of the post-ingestion rise in heat production. Recent work suggests the gut derived hormone secretin may play a key role in this effect, directly linking BAT activation to the alimentary tract. Not only gut hormones but also metabolites derived from gut microbiota such as butyrate may be an important activator of BAT during cold exposure. Additional regulatory factors include bone morphogenic proteins, fibroblast growth factor 21, Vascular endothelial growth factors and transient receptor potential vanilloid receptors which are important components of thermal sensing and hence how brown adipose tissue responds to the cold. In the future the main challenge is to understand how these regulatory factors combine with each other and with inhibitory factors to control heat production from BAT, and what their relative importance is in differing circumstances. Knocking out UCP1 has revealed other sources of heat production in BAT including creatine-dependent cycles and a futile cycle of Ca<sup>2+</sup> shuttling into and out of the endoplasmic reticulum via the SERCA and ryanodine receptors.

[PMID: 30637351] Circadian clocks synchronize the daily functions of organisms with environmental cues like light-dark cycles and feeding rhythms. The master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus of the brain and the many clocks in the periphery are organized in a hierarchical manner; the master clock synchronizes the peripheral clocks, and the peripheral clocks provide feedback to the master clock in return. Not surprisingly, it has been shown that circadian rhythms and metabolism are closely linked. Metabolic disorders like obesity have a large cost to the individual and society and they are marked by adipose tissue and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria are central to energy metabolism and have key functions in processes like ATP production, oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species production and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Mitochondria also play an important role in adipose tissue homeostasis and remodeling. Despite the extensive research investigating the link between circadian clock and metabolism, the circadian regulation of adipose tissue and mitochondria has mostly been unexplored until recently, and the emerging data in this topic are the focus of this review.

[PMID: 27298322] Skeletal muscle has been suggested as a site of nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) besides brown adipose tissue (BAT). Studies in birds, which do not contain BAT, have demonstrated the importance of skeletal muscle-based NST. However, muscle-based NST in mammals remains poorly characterized. We recently reported that sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) cycling and that its regulation by SLN can be the basis for muscle NST. Because of the dominant role of BAT-mediated thermogenesis in rodents, the role of muscle-based NST is less obvious. In this study, we investigated whether muscle will become an important site of NST when BAT function is conditionally minimized in mice. We surgically removed interscapular BAT (iBAT, which constitutes ∼70% of total BAT) and exposed the mice to prolonged cold (4 °C) for 9 days. The iBAT-ablated mice were able to maintain optimal body temperature (∼35-37 °C) during the entire period of cold exposure. After 4 days in the cold, both sham controls and iBAT-ablated mice stopped shivering and resumed routine physical activity, indicating that they are cold-adapted. The iBAT-ablated mice showed higher oxygen consumption and decreased body weight and fat mass, suggesting an increased energy cost of cold adaptation. The skeletal muscles in these mice underwent extensive remodeling of both the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, including alteration in the expression of key components of Ca(2+) handling and mitochondrial metabolism. These changes, along with increased sarcolipin expression, provide evidence for the recruitment of NST in skeletal muscle. These studies collectively suggest that skeletal muscle becomes the major site of NST when BAT activity is minimized.",10

Translating this potential of DNA nanostructure-based constructs to real life applications relies on maintaining and enhancing the structural integrity and functions of the surface-anchored moieties. In this study, we explored the possibility of utilizing choline dihydrogen phosphate (CDHP) solution, an aqueous solution of ionic liquid, to assemble DNA nanostructures of different sizes and complexities with enhanced biostability and ligand binding affinity. We show successful formation of the DNA nanostructures in aqueous CDHP solution using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and circular dichroism (CD). Biostability assays reveal that the aqueous CDHP solution may provide passive protection to DNA nanostructures against DNase I and human serum for up to 48 h. We also demonstrate that this enhanced biostability arises both from the structural conformation imparted during CDHP-mediated folding and from the presence of free CDHP ions in the solution. Notably, removal of free ions reduced the passive protection effect, but did not eliminate it, indicating the contribution of both folding and surrounding free ions. Using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we show that the presence of aqueous CDHP solution can enhance the binding of aptamer-functionalized DNA nanostructures to specific receptors on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Our strategy of using ionic liquid solution for one-pot preparation with enhanced stability and functionality offers a robust, simpler and faster alternative for DNA nanostructure-based constructs.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187218] Given the urgent need for more specific, sensitive, and non-invasive markers for prostate cancer screening and differential diagnosis, circulating miRNAs have emerged as valuable candidates. Sixty seven prostate cancer subjects in different stages were included in this study. The participants were categorized into groups based on their pathological characteristics as local, biochemical relapse and metastatic. We retrieved eligible datasets from GEO database to identify stage-specific differentially expressed up/down-regulated genes. Cytohubba, built-in application of Cytoscape software, and Reactome pathway database were applied to select hub genes. To select upstream miRNAs, we utilized the MiRWalk and miRNet online tools. To construct the miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks, we employed rna22. Finally, three miRNAs and five target genes were validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PCa patients compared with benign prostate hyperplasia. PSA level was also measured using ELISA. Our findings revealed the potential role of PRC1 and UBA52 to be used as biomarkers for the metastatic stage, RCC1 for both biochemical relapse, and metastatic subjects. Furthermore, elevated levels of miR-124-3p and downregulation of miR-133a-3p can be introduced as biochemical relapse stage identifier. We also identified the tumor suppressor role of miR-17-5p, which was associated with higher Gleason scores. We propose PRC1, UBA52, RCC1, miR-124-3p and miR133a-3p as stage-specific PCa identifiers.

[PMID: 41187171] Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a highly aggressive lung cancer with poor prognosis due to lack of reliable biomarkers. Resistance to anoikis drives tumor progression and metastasis. This study aims to develop and validate an anoikis-related prognostic model for LUAD. We employed univariate Cox regression analysis, LASSO regression, and random forest algorithms to identify anoikis-related genes (ARG) from bulk transcriptomic datasets, and establish a 7-gene prognostic signature, validated in two LUAD cohorts from GEO database. We evaluated immune infiltration, molecular functions, and genomic alterations between risk groups and analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data. IHC and mIF validated TIMP1 expression and its interaction with Treg cells. We developed a 7-gene prognostic model (LDHA, PLK1, TRAF2, ITGB4, SLCO1B3, TIMP1, ZEB2) using machine learning to predict survival in LUAD patients. The model accurately predicted 1-year survival rates (GSE31210: AUC = 0.805; GSE30219: AUC = 0.787), 2-year survival rates (GSE31210: AUC = 0.769; GSE30219: AUC = 0.681), and 3-year survival rates (GSE31210: AUC = 0.695; GSE30219: AUC = 0.735) and correlated with clinical features, immune infiltration, and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling. Single-cell sequencing data showed that LUAD patients exhibited an immunosuppressive TME phenotype, which was exacerbated by high TIMP1 expression in epithelial cells, promoting Treg cell activity. The 7-gene ARG prognostic model established in this study shows promising potential as a clinically applicable tool for decision-making.

[PMID: 41186991] Predictive biomarkers to guide chemotherapy decisions for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are lacking. Preclinical studies indicate that circulating tumor cell (CTC) studies of chromosomal instability (CTC-CIN) can predict taxane resistance. The CARD trial randomized subjects with mCRPC progressing within a year of treatment with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI; enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone/prednisone) to cabazitaxel or the alternative ARPI. As a pre-planned biomarker analysis, CTCs were isolated from blood samples obtained at baseline; cycle two, and end of treatment. Associations between baseline CTC and CTC-CIN counts with imaging-based progression free survival (ibPFS), overall survival (OS), time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, RECIST 1.1 objective response rate (ORR), and PSA50 response rate (PRR) were assessed. High baseline CTC-CIN counts significantly associated with worse OS after adjustment for confounding variables (median OS, 15.3 vs 8.9 months; univariate HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.52 - 3.06; p < 0.001; multivariate HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.01 - 2.43; p = 0.047). Detectable CTC-CIN counts at baseline may predict a lack of ibPFS and OS benefit when comparing cabazitaxel to ARPI. This preplanned biomarker analysis of CARD confirms that CTC-CIN counts are a clinically useful prognostic and predictive biomarker of taxane resistance in mCRPC. Detectable CTC-CIN at baseline defines a patient subpopulation with unmet clinical needs in which alternative therapeutics should be tested. CARD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02485691.

[PMID: 41186920] Microscopic examination of tissue morphology using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a standard practice in histopathology for analyzing tissue specimens. In preclinical models of cancer, H&E-stained tissue sections are routinely used to assess tumor development and progression, including parameters such as tumor number, size, and histopathological features. Recent advances in whole-slide scanning and digital pathology now enable quantitative analysis of high-resolution digital images on a computer, replacing the need to examine physical tissue slides under a microscope. However, quantifying tumors on H&E-stained digital sections remains challenging, highlighting the need for accessible and reproducible methods that can be adapted to diverse tumor models. Here, we present two efficient workflows using QuPath, an open-source software for digital pathology and whole-slide image analysis, to quantify tumor multiplicity (i.e., the number of tumors) and tumor burden (e.g., tumor surface area) based on digitally captured H&E-stained tissue sections. As a proof of concept, we apply these workflows to two distinct lung cancer models: (1) an orthotopic model in which Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells are delivered intranasally or intravenously into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, resulting in well-separated, easily distinguishable tumors amenable to manual quantification; and (2) a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) with lung-specific expression of oncogenic Kras<sup>G12D</sup>, characterized by infiltrative tumors that are less clearly demarcated due to integration with stromal and immune components, making them more suitable for semi-automated analysis. These Basic Protocols provide accessible and reproducible methods for quantifying tumor development that can be adapted to diverse cancer models. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

[PMID: 41186893] Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, with its pathogenesis involving complex biological processes such as DNA damage, epigenetic modification and oncogene mutation. Over the past two decades, the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the occurrence, metastasis and progression of HCC has received increasing attention. As an important noncoding RNA molecule, lncRNAs play a key role in regulating gene expression, affecting RNA transcription and mRNA stability. This review elucidates the potential pathogenic processes of HCC and elaborates on the synthesis mechanisms of the above three non-coding RNAs. It comprehensively summarizes various non-coding RNAs that have been identified as playing key regulatory roles in HCC, as well as how these non-coding RNAs affect disease progression by regulating gene expression and protein functions. For example: lncRNAs such as NEAT1, DSCR8, PNUTS, HULC, and HOTAIR can play different roles in the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HCC cells in different ways. lncRNAs such as HClnc1, LINC01343, FAM111A-DT, CERS6-AS1, and TLNC1 significantly affect the progression of HCC by regulating key signaling axes or protein functions, and are closely related to the prognosis of patients. In addition, we also discuss the potential of lncRNAs as therapeutic targets for HCC, such as: lncRNA MIR31HG, CASC2c, and lncRNA AC115619. Furthermore, we also explore the application prospects of lncRNAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new perspectives and directions for future HCC research.

[PMID: 41186887] This research examines how NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) and its functional variant rs2273534 influence gastric cancer (GC) risk, development, and prognosis, along with the molecular pathways involved. 840 GC patients and 840 healthy controls participated in a case-control research. Genetic association analyses, molecular experiments (qRT-PCR, Western blot, functional assays), and bioinformatics approaches were employed. Cell-based and animal experiments were employed to validate the oncogenic role of NKILA and its regulatory axis. Carriers of the NKILA rs2273534 C allele exhibited a markedly higher susceptibility to GC (OR = 1.51, p = 0.003) and an unfavorable prognosis (HR = 1.89, p = 0.016), which was also associated with elevated NKILA expression. Elevated NKILA expression in GC tissues was associated with advanced clinicopathological characteristics. Mechanistically, NKILA promotes the expression of 5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 2 (OAS2) through sponging miR-4424, which in turn facilitates proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in GC cells. Rescue experiments confirmed that the NKILA/miR-4424/OAS2 axis is crucial for GC malignancy. The rs2273534 SNP enhances NKILA expression and drives GC progression through the NKILA/miR-4424/OAS2 axis. Our findings highlight rs2273534 as a possible indicator for GC susceptibility and prognosis, offering insights into the oncogenic mechanisms mediated by lncRNAs.

[PMID: 41186886] Procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1) is important for extracellular matrix formation and is involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer; however, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mechanistic importance of PLOD1 as a regulator of GC. We examined the potential function and prognostic efficiency of PLOD1 in GC using a variety of bioinformatics methods. In vitro, we assessed the ability of PLOD1 to regulate GC by CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, and Elisa assay analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of PLOD1 on the immune escape of GC cells by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Elisa assay. Analysis of PLOD1 expression in gastric cancer and other cancers in public databases as well as survival showed that low expression of PLOD1 has better survival, while the AUC area under the ROC curve of this gene showed that this gene has better prognostic value. Meanwhile, the results of correlation analysis between PLOD1 and 60 immune checkpoints showed that the gene was positively correlated with immune checkpoint genes, and one of the genes with the largest correlation was CD276, and the pearson's correlation between PLOD1 and cancer immune cycle was also calculated, and the relationship between PLOD1 and the immune microenvironment was evaluated, and the enrichment of the immune infiltration analysis into a larger number of immune cells among which the importance of PLOD1 was determined. Differential gene analysis was then performed on the gastric cancer dataset, using the differential genes to perform WGCNA network co-expression analysis with the PLOD1 gene, and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed on these differential genes, enriching for cancer-related pathways and cell cycle signaling pathways. Two key genes were then obtained in the analysis with glycolysis, while drug sensitivity analysis was performed, yielding multiple potential drugs such as AZD7545, BRD-K03911514 and BRD-K14844214. Furthermore, in vitro experiments further demonstrated that PLOD1 increased the proliferation and migration ability of GC cells by promoting immune escape. The results of this study suggest that PLOD1 is an important regulator of GC progression and participates in the immune escape process of GC, which is expected to be a potential target for GC treatment.",10
Cancers that initially benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor targeted therapies later become refractory through several mechanisms.,Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor AND Targeted Therapies AND Cancer Resistance AND Mechanisms,"41184109,41168408,41167802,41166929,41165900,41158206,41158042,41155830,41155483,41152910","[PMID: 41184109] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major chronic respiratory condition with high morbidity and mortality, imposing a serious economic and public health burden. The World Health Organization ranks COPD among the top 4 chronic diseases worldwide. Zangsiwei Qingfei Mixture (ZSWQF), a novel Tibetan herbal formulation independently developed by our research team, has shown therapeutic potential for chronic respiratory diseases. This study aims to evaluate the effects of aerosolized ZSWQF on cigarette smoke-induced COPD in mice and explore its underlying mechanisms. Thirty C57 mice were randomly divided into a Control group, a COPD group, and a ZSWQF group. The Control group received saline aerosol inhalation without cigarette smoke exposure; both the COPD group and the ZSWQF group were exposed to cigarette smoke, with the former receiving saline inhalation and the latter treated with ZSWQF aerosol. White blood cell (WBC) count was performed using a fully automatic blood cell analyzer. Serum, alanine transaminase (ALT), and serum creatinine (SCr), as well as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). BALF cell classification was determined using a hematology analyzer. Lung function was assessed with a small animal pulmonary function system, including airway resistance (RI) and cyclic dynamic compliance (CyDN). Lung tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), and mean linear intercept (MLI) and destruction index (DI) were calculated to evaluate morphological changes. Network pharmacology was applied to identify disease-related and ZSWQF-related targets, followed by intersection and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and enrichment analysis of biological functions and pathways. Primary type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC II) from SD rats were isolated and divided into a Control group, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, a normal serum group, a water extract of ZSWQF (W-ZSWQF) group, a ZSWQF containing serum group, and a MLN-4760 [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 inhibitor]. Western blotting was performed to assess protein expression of ACE, p38 [a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)], phospho (p)-p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p-ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p-JNK, inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IκBα), p-IκBα, and p-p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κBp65). WBC counts were significantly higher in the COPD group than in controls (<i>P</i><0.01) and decreased following ZSWQF treatment (<i>P</i><0.05). No significant intergroup differences were found in organ weights, ALT, or SCr (all <i>P</i>>0.05). Serum and BALF levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, as well as total BALF cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, were elevated in the COPD group compared with controls and reduced by ZSWQF treatment (<i>P</i><0.05). COPD mice exhibited increased RI, decreased CyDN, marked alveolar congestion, inflammatory infiltration, thickened septa, and higher MLI and DI values versus controls (<i>P</i><0.05); ZSWQF treatment significantly reduced MLI and DI (<i>P</i><0.05). Network pharmacology identified 151 potential therapeutic targets for ZSWQF against COPD, with key nodes including TNF, IL-6, protein kinase B (Akt) 1, albumin (ALB), tumor protein p53 (TP53), non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT) 3, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and beta-catenin (CTNNB1). Enrichment analysis indicates involvement of cancer-related, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, calcium, and MAPK signaling pathways. Western blotting results showed that compared with the LPS group, AEC II treated with ZSWQF-containing serum exhibited decreased expression of ACE, p-p38/p38, p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, p-JNK/JNK, p-IκBα/IκBα, and p-NF-κBp65, while ACE2 expression was upregulated, consistent with the MAPK/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway regulation predicted by network pharmacology. Aerosolized ZSWQF provides protective effects in COPD mice by reducing airway inflammation and remodeling.

[PMID: 41168408] In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), the emergence of acquired resistance remains a significant challenge. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of resistance is crucial for developing novel strategies to overcome or delay therapeutic escape. To this end, this study aimed to identify key drivers of EGFR-TKIs resistance and explore actionable targets for intervention. We investigated resistance mechanisms by integrating CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide screening with tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic analysis, and virtually screened bioactive small molecule libraries to identify compounds capable of restoring EGFR-TKIs sensitivity. The multi-omics approach revealed that CCT2 is a critical mediator of resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer, with higher expression of CCT2 observed in resistant cells compared to sensitive cells. Mechanistically, CCT2 recruits tripartite motif-containing protein 28 (TRIM28) to catalyze SUMO2 modification of thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 1 (TMX1), inhibiting its ubiquitination and enhancing protein stability. This post-translational modification (PTM) promotes TMX1-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) clearance, thereby conferring resistance. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition with the compound HY-10127, identified through virtual screening, effectively restored EGFR-TKIs sensitivity in resistant cell lines and delayed the development of resistance in xenograft models. The findings establish the CCT2/TRIM28/TMX1/ROS axis as a novel resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutated lung cancer, and targeting this pathway with HY-10127 represents a promising strategy to overcome resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs, providing preclinical rationale for clinical translation. These discoveries advance our understanding of molecular resistance mechanisms and offer potential therapeutic targets for improving lung cancer prognosis.

[PMID: 41167802] Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; <i>ERBB2</i>) is overexpressed or amplified in 15-20% of gastric cancers (HER2+ GC). Within individual HER2+ GCs, HER2/<i>ERBB2</i> expression is often variable. Although HER2 therapeutic targeting improves outcomes for HER2+ GC patients, acquired resistance is frequent. To spatially interrogate HER2+ GC interpatient and intrapatient heterogeneity and resistance mechanisms associated with HER2-targeting agents (trastuzumab, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)). Spatial transcriptomic analysis (GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler) was applied to >1500 regions of interest in 30 GCs-these contained 15 HER2+ GCs treated with trastuzumab and T-DXd subsequently. Analysis of patient-matched samples with acquired trastuzumab or T-DXd resistance revealed escape mechanisms. Results were validated by immunohistochemistry, independent cohorts and patient-derived xenografts and organoids. HER2+ tumours exhibited <i>PD-L1</i> expression within the spatial tumour microenvironment. We observed increased expression of CLDN18.2, a promising therapeutic target, in trastuzumab-resistant tumours. One-third of HER2+ GC patients developed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) on trastuzumab resistance, associated with <i>PD-L1</i> and <i>CCL2</i> upregulation. Another third of trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ GC patients activated the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway including genes such as <i>GOLM1</i>. HLA loss and increases in oxidative phosphorylation pathways were observed in T-DXd-resistant GCs. Our results delineate multiple acquired resistance mechanisms to trastuzumab and T-DXd in HER2+ GC <i>in vivo</i>. This information may guide trials combining trastuzumab or T-DXd with new agents to enhance the efficacy and durability of HER2 blockade.

[PMID: 41166929] Although treatments for HNSCC have improved, the cancer is still challenging because many patients tend to develop the disease again nearby and often have poor recovery. Since drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells display a wide range of types and unique genetic characteristics, nonhormonal endocrine therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, are ineffective in eliminating these cells. DTP cells evade elimination by entering a reversible dormant state characterized by altered metabolism, enhanced DNA repair capacity, and modified immune escape mechanisms, all of which promote the cells' survival and treatment failure. Platinum-based chemotherapy, widely prescribed for HNSCC, reduces tumor size but fails to confer long-term benefits because of the strong treatment resistance of DTP cells. These cells also exhibit resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors by activating alternative signaling pathways. Alternative survival pathways are also activated in DTP cells when targeted therapies such as those using epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are used. Although programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors are exciting new treatments, their effect is hampered by DTP cells that affect the immune system. This review examines the ways DTP cells make HNSCC tumor cells resistant to treatment by looking at metabolic reprogramming, DNA methylation alterations and the microenvironment of the tumor. This review further explores strategies for targeting metabolic dependencies, inhibiting DNA repair, and combining therapeutic approaches, all of which can mitigate DTP cell-mediated recurrence. Advancing strategies that specifically target DTP cells could enhance HNSCC management by reducing recurrence and improving overall prognosis.

[PMID: 41165900] Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ERBB2) is a well-established therapeutic target in breast and gastric cancers, but its relevance in prostate cancer (PC) remains unresolved. Although HER2 gene amplification is relatively uncommon in PC, heterogeneous overexpression has been observed, particularly in advanced and castration-resistant PC (CRPC), where it is frequently associated with aggressive clinicopathological features. Experimental studies portray HER2 as a signaling hub, mediating crosstalk with androgen receptor (AR) signaling to sustain tumor growth under androgen-deprived conditions. Concurrent activation of the HER2-PI3K-AKT axis further promotes cell survival, proliferation, and therapeutic adaptation. Moreover, HER2 cooperates with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and NF-κB pathways, reinforcing tumor plasticity and resistance mechanisms. Despite these compelling biological insights, clinical translation has been disappointing. Early trials with Trastuzumab, Lapatinib, and Pertuzumab yielded minimal benefit, underscoring patient heterogeneity, pathway redundancy, and the lack of biomarker-guided stratification. Lessons from these failures highlight the need for precision oncology approaches that integrate molecular profiling and rational therapeutic combinations. Recent advances, including next-generation HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and CAR-T cell therapies, as well as strategies combining HER2 inhibition with AR signaling blockade, PI3K/AKT inhibitors, or immunotherapy, offer renewed promise. HER2 in PC thus represents a paradox: biologically significant but clinically underexploited. Reframing HER2 within the AR-PI3K signaling network and leveraging biomarker-driven strategies may finally unlock its therapeutic potential. This review critically examines HER2 in PC, analyzing its mechanistic roles, therapeutic potential, and the challenges that shape its value as both a prognostic biomarker and actionable target.

[PMID: 41158206] This literature review investigates the mechanisms of resistance to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies in HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, a subtype that accounts for approximately 20% of breast cancer cases. Despite the effectiveness of treatments such as trastuzumab and lapatinib, many patients experience either primary or acquired resistance, leading to treatment failure. The review systematically categorizes various resistance mechanisms, including the role of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaΒ (RANK) expression, which has been shown to activate the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) pathway, promoting cell survival and contributing to resistance. Other mechanisms include the activation of alternative signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, and the involvement of tumor-associated fibroblasts, which can drive resistance through receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. Additionally, the review highlights the importance of understanding these mechanisms to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies. By identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, the review suggests that combining HER2 inhibitors with agents that target resistance pathways may enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes. Overall, this review underscores the complexity of HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer treatment and the need for continued research to overcome resistance challenges.

[PMID: 41158042] Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations play a role as a driver gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC harboring HER2 mutations exhibit poor responses to conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy, hence targeted therapies against HER2 are under extensive investigation. This review analyzes the biological characteristics of HER2, an overview of clinical trials for targeted therapy drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and antibody-drug conjugate, and research directions for drug resistance in NSCLC. Currently, Pyrotinib and Trastuzumab deruxtecan have been approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with HER2 mutations, suitable for patients who have failed standard therapy, which is far from meeting the clinical demands. Novel selective HER2 TKIs are gradually emerging. Future exploration trends are gradually shifting from single drugs to combination strategies, and are exploring more precise selection strategies as well as research on resistance mechanisms. These studies will provide a theoretical basis for clinical treatment strategies for advanced NSCLC with HER2 mutations, promoting the development of personalized therapy. .

[PMID: 41155830] <i>Background and Objectives</i>: Erlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is an established therapy for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that chronic stress, mediated through β-adrenergic signaling, promotes tumor progression, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance. Furthermore, interactions between β-adrenergic signaling and EGFR pathways have been hypothesized to negatively influence treatment responses. Based on this rationale, we investigated whether concomitant beta-blocker use may improve survival outcomes in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This retrospective analysis included 103 patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC who received erlotinib. Patients were classified according to concurrent beta-blocker use, defined as continuous therapy for at least six months prior to erlotinib initiation, prescribed for cardiovascular indications. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between beta-blocker users and non-users. <i>Results</i>: Patients receiving erlotinib with concomitant beta-blocker therapy achieved a median PFS (mPFS) of 21.4 months (95% CI, 13.1-29.7), compared with 9.7 months (95% CI, 6.7-12.7) in non-users (<i>p</i> = 0.003). Median OS (mOS) was 32.4 months (95% CI, 14.8-50.0) in the beta-blocker group versus 19.9 months (95% CI, 14.8-25.0) in the non-beta-blocker group (<i>p</i> = 0.010). Multivariate Cox regression confirmed beta-blocker use as an independent prognostic factor for both PFS (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and OS (<i>p</i> = 0.014). <i>Conclusions</i>: Concomitant beta-blocker use was associated with significantly prolonged survival in patients with EGFR-mutant metastatic NSCLC receiving erlotinib. These findings support the hypothesis that β-adrenergic inhibition enhances the efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapy. Prospective studies are warranted to validate these results and to further elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.

[PMID: 41155483] Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with significant resistance to conventional therapies, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. <i>Moringa oleifera</i> (<i>M. oleifera</i>), a medicinal plant rich in diverse bioactive compounds, has shown promising potential for anti-lung carcinoma activity. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of <i>M. oleifera</i> bioactive compounds for their anti-lung cancer activities through an integrated network modeling and molecular docking approach. By constructing comprehensive compound-target-lung cancer pathway networks, we aim to elucidate the multitarget pharmacology of <i>M. oleifera</i> compounds, providing valuable insights into their potential as therapeutic candidates. Computational pipeline was applied to identify 180 phytochemicals from <i>M. oleifera</i>, filtered using Lipinski's Rule of Five and ADMET properties, resulting in 10 lead compounds followed by their potential biological target proteins in regulating lung cancer progression. We identified 80 targeted proteins involved in lung cancer, with EGFR being the most enriched in pathway enrichment analysis. In the molecular docking analysis, caffeic acid showed the highest binding score (-28.97 kcal/mol) with EGFR forming stable complex during molecular dynamics simulations compared to the known EGFR inhibitor 'erlotinib'. The overall results suggest that caffeic acid, a key bioactive compound in <i>M. oleifera</i>, is an EGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling inhibitor for lung cancer therapy, warranting further experimental validation to translate these findings into clinical applications.

[PMID: 41152910] Despite an initial favorable response of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to osimertinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), resistance to this drug inevitably develops. Whereas genetic mechanisms for such acquired resistance have been identified, the molecular mediators of resistance induction have remained unclear. To identify factors that mediate induction of osimertinib resistance, we studied clinical samples from individuals with EGFR-mutant NSCLC as well as cell lines including PC-9 and H1975. Methods adopted included transcriptomics analysis and immunohistochemistry of pretreatment NSCLC specimens, spatial transcriptomics analysis, a cell viability assay, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR analysis, RNA sequencing, immunoblot analysis, comprehensive proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, and a mouse xenograft tumor model. Transcriptomics analysis of pretreatment clinical specimens identified IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3) as a gene specifically upregulated in patients with a poor response to osimertinib treatment. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that patients with IFITM3-positive tumors experienced a shorter progression-free survival on osimertinib treatment. Spatial transcriptomics and other analyses further revealed that IFITM3 expression in tumor cells was increased in response to cytokines derived from the tumor microenvironment (TME) during osimertinib treatment. IFITM3 was found to promote the development of osimertinib resistance in NSCLC cell lines through interaction with MET and activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, combined treatment with a MET inhibitor suppressed the development of osimertinib resistance in a mouse xenograft tumor model. Our findings reveal that upregulation of IFITM3 driven by TME cytokines represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of osimertinib resistance, and they suggest that targeting of the IFITM3-MET axis may improve EGFR-TKI treatment outcome for EGFR-mutant NSCLC.",10

Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187367] Flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are emerging as a promising photovoltaic technology for portable and wearable electronics, offering excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and ease of processing. In this work, we present five newly designed foldable hole transport materials (HTMs), labeled C1M1-C1M5, engineered by thiophene-bridged acceptor modifications of the reference CM molecule. Using density functional theory (DFT), we explore the structural, electronic, optical, and photovoltaic properties of these molecules. The results show that the newly designed HTMs exhibit narrow band gaps (1.65-2.32 eV), significantly lower than the CM reference (3.75 eV). Notably, the extended conjugation length of the molecules contributes to their red-shifted absorption (up to 832 nm), enhanced dipole moments (ranging from 6.37 to 19.14 D), and improved exciton dissociation, particularly for C1M5, with an exciton binding energy of 0.22 eV. Furthermore, the charge transport characteristics were found to be promising, with C1M4 exhibiting the highest charge transmission (λe = 0.036577, λh = 0.050162), where electron transport was slightly more favorable than hole transport. In conclusion, these newly engineered HTMs are highly promising for next-generation solar devices due to their excellent solution processability, efficient light harvesting, and charge transport capabilities.

[PMID: 41187341] Although acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a preventable condition, it continues to be diagnosed in Far North Queensland, Australia. Enhanced primary prevention is necessary to reduce the local burden of ARF and rheumatic heart disease. In this retrospective clinical audit, all cases of definite ARF in the remote Torres Strait and Cape York region of Far North Queensland between January 2020 and December 2024 were examined. Clinical records were reviewed to identify and characterize any healthcare presentations of individuals during the 6 weeks preceding their ARF diagnosis. Of 67 individuals with definite ARF 65 (97%) identified as First Nations Australians; 43/67 (64%) did not present for any healthcare in the 6 weeks preceding their diagnosis; and a further 10/67 (15%) presented for healthcare that was unrelated to group A Streptococcus (Strep A) infection. Overall, a possible Strep A infection (skin infection or sore throat) was identified in 14/67 (21%) patients; 9/67 (13%) patients presented with skin infections, and 5/67 (7%) presented with sore throats. Of these, 5/14 (36%) received appropriate antibiotic treatment. Most individuals with definite ARF in this remote region of Australia do not present for healthcare before their diagnosis; however, there remain opportunities for the primary prevention of ARF among those who do. Culturally considered health promotion, opportunistic screening, and improved recognition and treatment of Strep A infection are critical for reducing ARF incidence in this region of Australia. It is also important to define the contribution of asymptomatic Strep A infections to the pathogenesis of ARF.

[PMID: 41187335] DNA nanostructure-enabled functional constructs have shown potential to improve healthcare outcomes by offering advanced disease diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Translating this potential of DNA nanostructure-based constructs to real life applications relies on maintaining and enhancing the structural integrity and functions of the surface-anchored moieties. In this study, we explored the possibility of utilizing choline dihydrogen phosphate (CDHP) solution, an aqueous solution of ionic liquid, to assemble DNA nanostructures of different sizes and complexities with enhanced biostability and ligand binding affinity. We show successful formation of the DNA nanostructures in aqueous CDHP solution using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and circular dichroism (CD). Biostability assays reveal that the aqueous CDHP solution may provide passive protection to DNA nanostructures against DNase I and human serum for up to 48 h. We also demonstrate that this enhanced biostability arises both from the structural conformation imparted during CDHP-mediated folding and from the presence of free CDHP ions in the solution. Notably, removal of free ions reduced the passive protection effect, but did not eliminate it, indicating the contribution of both folding and surrounding free ions. Using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we show that the presence of aqueous CDHP solution can enhance the binding of aptamer-functionalized DNA nanostructures to specific receptors on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Our strategy of using ionic liquid solution for one-pot preparation with enhanced stability and functionality offers a robust, simpler and faster alternative for DNA nanostructure-based constructs.

[PMID: 41187318] Synchronous oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a unique clinical entity with potential benefit from radical local consolidative therapy (LCT). However, robust tools to stratify patients most likely to benefit from radical LCT are lacking. We identified patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC from the SEER 17 registry (2018-2021). Radical LCT was defined as surgical resection of the primary tumor (±metastasectomy) and/or radiotherapy. Patients were stratified accordingly. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox models with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding. A weighted random survival forest (RSF) model and SHAP analysis were applied to capture nonlinear interactions and key prognostic determinants. Model discrimination was assessed by C-index, AUC, and integrated Brier score (IBS). Among 5,377 patients, 221 received radical LCT. The radical LCT group was younger, had earlier T stage, smaller tumors, and more frequent brain metastases. Median overall survival (mOS) was significantly longer in the radical LCT group than the no-LCT group (27 vs. 7 months; p<0.001), with maximal benefit among those also receiving chemotherapy (mOS: 30 months). The RSF model outperformed Cox regression in training (C-index: 0.752 vs. 0.735) with similar validation results. Chemotherapy (HR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.36-0.46; p<0.001) and radical LCT (HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.91; p = 0.018) were independent favorable factors. SHAP analysis demonstrated that radical LCT and chemotherapy contributed most to risk reduction in the survival prediction model, with consistent protective effects observed across different age, T stage, and histological subgroups. This multi-center, population-based study is the first to establish and internally validate a machine learning-based risk stratification tool for patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC. Radical LCT, particularly when combined with chemotherapy, was associated with improved OS in this cohort. The model may facilitate preliminary risk stratification and assist multidisciplinary management, but external validation and integration of key clinical and molecular variables are needed before clinical application. Prospective multicenter validation is warranted.

[PMID: 41187307] Vascular dysfunction contributes to Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRDs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies link midlife hemostasis and platelet aggregation measures to late-life dementia risk. We aimed to determine whether platelet aggregation in midlife is associated with imaging markers of AD pathology. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated associations between platelet aggregation, measured by light transmission aggregometry, and amyloid (<sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET uptake in dementia-free, middle-aged adults from the Framingham Heart Study. Co-primary outcomes included amyloid and tau uptake in AD-vulnerable regions. We also examined an MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk as a secondary outcome. We used multivariable regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, considering potential nonlinear associations. Platelet aggregation response was evaluated in 382 participants (mean age 56 ± 8 years, 53% female) approximately 1.2-1.5 years before amyloid and tau PET imaging. MRI data used for the AD signature were acquired together with PET imaging or within several months. The aggregation response exhibited a nonlinear association with AD pathology. Among those in the lowest tertile of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) response, platelet aggregation response was positively associated with increased amyloid in the precuneus (β = 0.047, <i>p</i> = 0.020) and tau in the rhinal (β = 0.077, <i>p</i> = 0.012), entorhinal (β = 0.066, <i>p</i> < 0.020), temporal global (β = 0.063, <i>p</i> = 0.031), and cortical (β = 0.064, <i>p</i> = 0.028) regions. For the secondary outcome analysis (n = 256), platelet aggregation response was negatively associated with the MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk (β = -0.002, <i>p</i> < 0.035), consistent with a neurodegenerative pattern. Our findings indicate that platelet aggregation is linked to PET and MRI markers of AD pathology as early as midlife. These findings support further investigation of platelet-mediated mechanisms in AD pathogenesis.

[PMID: 41187276] Amphiphilic molecules are attracting growing interest for diverse applications in drug delivery, advanced materials, and interfacial technologies. Their structural variations offer key insights into how molecular design influences self-assembly, interfacial behavior, and functional performance. This study examined the interfacial behavior of dihexadecylpyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate (EDTS)-based surfactants as a function of various structural modifications, including headgroup quaternization (EDTS<sup>+</sup>), zinc coordination to constrain the head-tail junction (Zn-EDTS), alteration of the head-tail linkage (ester vs imine, IDTS), along with a comparison with a conventional single-tail analogue (ECS). Gas-phase density functional theory calculations revealed V-shaped geometries with varying degrees of compactness for the investigated architectures. For Langmuir monolayer studies, surface pressure-area (π-<i>A</i>) isotherms demonstrated distinct differences in the interfacial behaviors of EDTS compared to their single-tailed analogues. These findings were supported by Brewster angle microscopy, surface potential-area (Δ<i>V</i>-<i>A</i>) isotherms and atomic force microscopy measurements of films fabricated at air-water and air-solid interfaces, showing that subtle architectural modifications significantly influence packing density and domain formation. Additionally, the effect of mixing with C16-chain amphiphiles, specifically their carboxylic acid, alcohol, and trimethylammonium variants, on EDTS monolayers was studied. <i>Headgroup compatibility</i> in this class of surfactants was evaluated by isolating <i>tail-tail packing</i> contributions from the excess Gibbs free energy of mixing (Δ<i>G</i><sub>mix</sub><sup>ex</sup>) for EDTS-ECS.

[PMID: 41187274] Pregnancy induces a range of physiological and musculoskeletal changes that can lead to orthopedic issues. This article examines etiologies and management strategies for outpatient orthopedic problems encountered during pregnancy. Hormonal changes, weight gain, and altered biomechanics contribute to common musculoskeletal complaints such as low back pain, pelvic girdle pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Although less common, osteoporosis can present during pregnancy. Additionally, domestic violence and interpartner violence are disproportionately more frequent in this population. This review highlights evidence-based approaches for diagnosis and treatment and emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary care, including obstetricians, orthopedic surgeons, endocrinologists, primary care physicians, and physical therapists.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.",10
Cellular clocks are associated with mitosis timing in NIH 3T3 cells.,cellular clocks AND mitosis timing AND circadian rhythm AND NIH 3T3 cells,"15550250,41186595,41186576,41186356,41185962,41185921,41185464,41185393,41184763,41184589","[PMID: 15550250] The mammalian circadian timing system is composed of a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain and subsidiary oscillators in most peripheral cell types. While oscillators in SCN neurons are known to function in a self-sustained fashion, peripheral oscillators have been thought to damp rapidly when disconnected from the control exerted by the SCN. Using two reporter systems, we monitored circadian gene expression in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts in real time and in individual cells. In conjunction with mathematical modeling and cell co-culture experiments, these data demonstrated that in vitro cultured fibroblasts harbor self-sustained and cell-autonomous circadian clocks similar to those operative in SCN neurons. Circadian gene expression in fibroblasts continues during cell division, and our experiments unveiled unexpected interactions between the circadian clock and the cell division clock. Specifically, the circadian oscillator gates cytokinesis to defined time windows, and mitosis elicits phase shifts in circadian cycles.

[PMID: 41186595] Investigating the impact of circadian syndrome (CircS) on the prognosis of NMIBC, identifying potential indicators affecting prognosis, and explaining NMIBC prognosis from the perspective of circadian rhythm disruption to provide a preventable risk factor. A total of 438 patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who received intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) were selected for retrospective analysis by retrieving medical records. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints were safety parameters. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to screen variables for COX regression. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analyses were used to validate the robustness of the results. Bootstrap and K-fold cross-validations were used to validate the robustness of the models. All adverse events (AEs) were further quantified for association strength using a logistic regression analysis. This retrospective study screened 406 patients who met the inclusion criteria for further analysis. Survival analysis demonstrated significantly lower RFS in patients with CircS compared to the non-CircS cohort (Log-rank P = 0.018; HR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.08-2.31). Multivariable analysis of LASSO-selected variables identified CircS (HR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.09-2.73, P = 0.021), male gender (HR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.12-3.72, P = 0.02), recurrence history (HR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.17-2.73, P = 0.007), and tumor diameter >3 cm (HR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.24-2.87, P = 0.003) as independent predictors of inferior RFS in NMIBC. Notably, elevated serum albumin levels exhibited protective effects (HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.98, P = 0.008). The prognostic significance of CircS remained robust across multiple RFS validation models, though no significant association was observed with PFS. In the analysis of AEs, patients with CircS showed significantly higher odds, such as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.63, P = 0.041), hematuria (OR = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.55-5.50, P<0.001), dysuria (OR = 4.26, 95% CI: 1.67-11.08, P = 0.002), lower abdominal pain (OR = 4.28, 95% CI: 1.59-11.73, P = 0.004), fatigue (OR = 3.86, 95% CI: 1.60-9.34, P = 0.002) and arthralgia or flu-like symptoms (OR = 7.30, 95% CI: 1.40-53.31, P = 0.023). CircS may serve as a potential risk factor affecting the prognosis of NMIBC, manifesting as worse RFS and AEs. Along with gender, tumor size, and recurrence history, it constitutes a high-risk factor for RFS. This finding provides clues for exploring potential causal relationships between clinical syndromes caused by circadian rhythm disruption and bladder tumor prognosis, while also reshaping the understanding of connections between chronic non-neoplastic diseases and neoplastic diseases.

[PMID: 41186576] Circadian clocks orchestrate the daily rhythms of physiological functions. The underlying mechanisms of circadian clocks are highly conserved across species, driven by endogenous transcriptional-translational feedback loops. CLOCK, a central transcription factor in circadian regulation, requires coregulatory factors and histone modification dynamics to regulate downstream clock-controlled gene expression. In this study, we identify the Drosophila polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) as a previously unrecognized regulator of the circadian transcriptional machinery. We found that knocking down different subunits of Paf1C in pacemaker neurons lengthens the circadian locomotion period. Specifically, downregulation of rtf1, a core subunit of Paf1C, significantly dampens the amplitude of circadian rhythms and extends the locomotor period. This effect is primarily attributed to a reduction in the pacemaker protein PERIOD (PER), mediated through decreased per transcription. Indeed, the overexpression of per in pacemaker neurons rescues the circadian defects caused by rtf1 downregulation. Mechanistically, we identified that rtf1 enhances CLK-mediated per transcription activation. RTF1 physically interacts with CLK, thus promoting its occupancy on the promoters of per and other clock genes. Furthermore, the H3K4me3 methyltransferase SET1 forms complex with CLK and RTF1, facilitates their interaction, and thereby increases H3K4me3 levels at the per/tim promoter to promote their expression. Notably, we discovered that human RTF1 physically interacts with BMAL1/CLOCK and affects the circadian rhythms in U2OS cells, indicating a potentially conserved mechanism in mammals. Together, our results demonstrate that RTF1 regulates circadian rhythms by modulating CLK occupancy and H3K4me3 levels at pacemaker gene promoters.

[PMID: 41186356] The cornea operates under robust circadian control and is essential for ocular-surface homeostasis. Hypoxic stress-prevalent in many eye disorders and systemic conditions-can disturb these rhythms and compromise epithelial, neural, and immune balance. Here, we examine how environmental hypoxia (EH) and chemical hypoxia (CH) reshape corneal clock-gene expression and tissue integrity. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to normoxia (NC), EH (10% O2), or CH (CoCl2, 15 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) for 14 days. Corneas were collected at 3-hour intervals across a 24-hour cycle for bulk RNA sequencing. Rhythmic genes were identified by Jonckheere-Terpstra-Kendall CYCLE (JTK_CYCLE), and pathway enrichment was assessed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Phase Set Enrichment Analysis (PSEA). Immunofluorescence staining evaluated epithelial junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin), neural markers (βIII-tubulin), and immune cells (Ly6G⁺ neutrophils, γδ T cells). Hypoxia significantly increased rhythmic transcripts (by ∼43% in EH and ∼35% in CH), with over 65% of rhythmic genes showing phase shifts. CH specifically upregulated core circadian clock genes (Per1, Cry2, Nr1d2, Rora) and downregulated Per2, possibly via HIF-1α-mediated mechanisms. Both EH and CH impaired epithelial barrier integrity, reduced corneal nerve density, and altered immune cell infiltration, with peak disruption at Zeitgeber time 18 (ZT18). Additionally, CH uniquely induced barrier dysfunction and immune suppression at ZT3, indicating a model-specific vulnerability window. Hypoxia drives model-specific and circadian phase-dependent reprogramming of corneal transcriptomic rhythms, resulting in coordinated structural and immune dysfunction. Identifying ZT18 and ZT3 as critical phases highlights the potential for chronotherapeutic interventions in hypoxia-related ocular surface disorders.

[PMID: 41185962] Ageing is a complex biological process driven, in part, by inflammaging. Recent research identifies the ectodysplasin A2 receptor (EDA2R) as a key regulator of inflammaging and a novel biomarker of ageing, with its expression increasing with age across diverse tissues in humans and animal models. Elevated EDA2R gene expression is associated with accelerated ageing, cellular senescence, frailty, obesity, acne, radiation response and increased levels of inflammatory, renal, cardiac and vascular biomarkers. Similarly, elevated EDA2R protein levels, a critical component of the proteomic ageing clock, are associated with a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, dementia, Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, various cancers, osteoarthritis, digestive diseases, diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ear and eye diseases, renal impairment, systemic autoimmune diseases, anaemia, bacterial infections, myositis, frailty, accelerated biological ageing, shorter telomere length, decreased healthspan and longevity, higher all-cause mortality and overall poor health. Beyond serving as a biomarker, EDA2R actively drives ageing, as its overexpression induces inflammation and tissue damage, whereas its inhibition mitigates these effects. Mechanistically, EDA2R activates non-canonical and canonical NF-κB signalling, promoting pro-inflammatory and catabolic processes that accelerate ageing phenotypes. Genetic variants of EDA2R are linked to alopecia, facial ageing, lipid profiles and prostate cancer. This review explores the structure and function of the EDA2R gene and protein, its role in tissue-specific ageing, and its therapeutic potential for multiple diseases. Although specific EDA2R antagonists are not yet available, interventions like calorie restriction, physical activity and specific supplements show promise in lowering EDA2R levels.

[PMID: 41185921] Night workers have demonstrated an increased risk of bone fracture. The mechanisms underlying the observed bone changes among night workers remain unclear. They have been attributed to hormonal changes resulting from exposure to light during nighttime, sleep restrictions and distur- bances in expression of circadian rhythms genes. An additional factor that may contribute to increased bone loss among night workers is the con- sumption of caffeinated products. The aim of the work was to review the epidemiological evidence on the association between caffeine consumption and bone density or fracture risk and to sum up the current knowledge on the association between night shift work and osteoporosis among workers. A search of the literature was conducted in order to identify proper studies using PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, and Springer databases. A total of 31 articles were identified. The articles were divided to 2 groups of papers assessing the bone fracture risk and osteoporosis among caffeinated beverages drinkers (24 studies) and assessing bone strength in night shifts workers (7 studies). Findings from studies assessing the relationship between caffeine consumption and bone strength appear inconsistent. However, the results of the some presented studies highlight that high caffeine intake increases bone loss. Thus development of osteoporosis among night workers exposed to light during nighttime might be accelerated by high caffeine consumption. No epidemiological study has examined the effect of caffeine intake on the bone fracture risk among night shifts workers yet. There is a great need to better understand the etiology of osteoporosis among workers. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2025;38(5).

[PMID: 41185464] Circadian rhythm is an essential biological process that synchronises physiological activities with environmental light/dark cycles. However, its regulatory mechanisms in tooth development remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in circadian rhythm regulation and daily mineralization during tooth development using immunofluorescence, circadian rhythm tracking, and genetic models. Spatiotemporal analysis of rat dental germs revealed that oscillatory expression patterns of p75NTR closely aligned with clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1, Per2), mineralization-related factors, and odontogenesis-related factors. p75NTR knockout mice (p75NTR<sup>ExIII-/-</sup>) exhibited reduced body weight, lower melatonin levels, delayed incisor eruption, decreased daily mineralization width, and downregulation of core clock genes. Mechanistically, p75NTR overexpression in immortalised stem cells from the dental apical papilla (iSCAPs) upregulated casein kinase 2 (CK2) expression, enhanced PER2 phosphorylation, and promoted nuclear p-PER2 accumulation, while CK2 inhibition partially reversed these effects. In vivo, CK2 inhibition via quinalizarin exacerbated incisor eruption defects in p75NTR<sup>ExIII-/-</sup> mice. These findings demonstrate that p75NTR regulates circadian-driven mineralization and tooth morphogenesis, probably via the CK2/PER2 pathway, providing critical insight into the interplay between the circadian rhythm and dental development.

[PMID: 41185393] Advanced dual-channel fluorescent probes for simultaneous biomarker detection are in critical demand nowadays in biomedical research. Herein, a blue-green emissive ratiometric probe CD@Tb has been engineered by coupling pyridinedicarboxylate-functionalized carbon dots (CD) with Tb<sup>3+</sup> ions. This probe exhibits ultrasensitive and selective detection of epinephrine (EP, LOD: 1.2 nM) and pyrophosphate (PPi, LOD: 0.25 μM) via distinct fluorescence responses: Epinephrine (EP) enhances the blue emission while suppressing the green emission by deactivating the excited state of terbium through energy transfer. In contrast, pyrophosphate (PPi) amplifies the green emission of terbium through bridging coordination by inducing carbon dot aggregation, which strengthens the antenna effect, while simultaneously diminishing the blue emission. The sensing efficiency of the probe was tested in real human blood serum samples to check its reliability. Moreover, after thorough testing of its biocompatibility, the CD@Tb probe was employed as an imaging tool for visualization of epinephrine in human neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y, and pyrophosphate in mouse fibroblast cells, NIH 3T3.

[PMID: 41184763] Bamboo, widely distributed in Southeast Asian and East Asia, is a palatable food resource, with its nutritional and low-fat properties, and functions in economic and ecological balance. As an important food source, some bamboo shoots often synthesize bitter chemicals in a special developing period or in a particular position of the shoot, which depends on the edible bamboo species. In this research, we focus on a sympodium bamboo, Bambusa oldhamii Munro, located in Southeast China, which has special biological properties. When the shoots are harvested underground, the shoots taste tender and tasty enough, but when the shoots erupt out of the soil surface with sunlight for days, the shoot has a little bitterness in the tip portion. This research conducts multi-omics approaches to investigate the bitter flavor formation with multiple developing phases of the shoot in B. oldhamii Munro. The PacBio and Hi-C technologies were used to sequence the hexaploid species, B. oldhamii Munro, for de novo genome assembly. The assembled genome size of B. oldhamii is 1,446 Mb, with a scaffold-level N50 equal to 38,936,033 bp. A total of 88,140 genes in the genome were acquired, and about 53.89% of the genome is occupied by repeat components. The BUSCO score is 96.59%, suggesting a relatively complete and reliable assembly. Three subgenomes (ABC) include 35 pseudo-chromosomes based on the synteny analysis with another hexaploid species, Dendrocalamus latiflorus. The technologies of transcriptome analysis on the genome level and widely targeted metabolome were used to classify the key transcription factors and key bitter metabolites that account for the bamboo shoot flavor transition of B. oldhamii from underground to above ground, especially in the multiple developing phases. We finally mined out several bitter metabolites belonging to amino acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, purines, and other families, and several related pathways of Circadian rhythm, plant hormone signal transduction, flavonoid biosynthesis, and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis. Additionally, from joint analysis between bitter metabolites and transcription factors, we found that the family of bHLH and HB- transcription factors might influence the shoot bitter flavor transition and formation via influencing the accumulation of bitter metabolites in B. oldhamii. In this research, we used Multi-omics methods to investigate the bitter flavor formation and transition in the shoot of B. oldhamii and hypothesized a simple model about this biological process. In a suitable circumstance (warm temperature and sunlight), the environment signals transduction influences the expression of transcription factor (bHLH, HB-, and others) which activate or suppress the expression level of genes or enzymes in the bitter flavor metabolites related pathways (biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, amino acid metabolism, biosynthesis of flavonoid, flavone, flavonol and isoflavonoid, plant hormone signal transduction and others), then causing the contents of bitter flavor metabolites (flavonoids, amino acids, terpenoids, cyanogenic glycosides and others) increase or decrease. This phenomenon influences the bitter flavor formation or transition in the shoot of B. oldhamii.

[PMID: 41184589] During development, stem and progenitor cells divide and transition through multipotent states to generate the diverse cell types by undergoing defined changes in biomolecular composition, which underlie the progressive loss of potency and acquisition of lineage-specific characteristics. For example, the cardiac and pharyngeal muscle programs are jointly primed in multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors, and segregate in distinct daughter cells only after cell division. Here, using the tunicate Ciona, we showed that multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors acquire the competence to produce distinct Tbx1/10 (+) and (-) daughter cells shortly before mitosis, which is necessary for Tbx1/10 activation. By combining transgene-based sample barcoding with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we uncovered transcriptome-wide dynamics in migrating cardiopharyngeal progenitors as cells progress through G1, S, and G2 phases. We refer to this process as ""transcriptome maturation"", and identified candidate mature genes, including the Rho GAP-coding gene Depdc1b, which peaks in late G2. Functional assays indicated that transcriptome maturation fosters cardiopharyngeal competence, in part through multilineage priming and by enabling asymmetric cell division that influences subsequent fate decisions, illustrating the concept of ""behavioral competence"". We show that both classic regulatory circuits and coupling with the G1-S transition drive transcriptome maturation, ensuring the timely deployment of lineage-specific programs.",10

To trace specific DNA sequences in living cells, we used programmable sequence-specific DNA binding of designer transcription activator-like effectors (dTALEs). We designed a recombinant dTALE (msTALE) with variable repeat domains to specifically bind a 19-bp target sequence of major satellite DNA. The msTALE was fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and stably expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells. Hybridization with a major satellite probe (3D-fluorescent in situ hybridization) and co-staining for known cellular structures confirmed in vivo binding of the GFP-msTALE to major satellite DNA present at nuclear chromocenters. Dual tracing of major satellite DNA and the replication machinery throughout S-phase showed co-localization during mid to late S-phase, directly demonstrating the late replication timing of major satellite DNA. Fluorescence bleaching experiments indicated a relatively stable but still dynamic binding, with mean residence times in the range of minutes. Fluorescently labeled dTALEs open new perspectives to target and trace DNA sequences and to monitor dynamic changes in subnuclear positioning as well as interactions with functional nuclear structures during cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation.

[PMID: 41187334] Hexokinase domain containing protein 1 (HKDC1) is a recently discovered fifth human hexokinase isozyme that is significantly upregulated in several disease states, including lung and liver cancers. Cellular studies suggest that HKDC1 is a low activity hexokinase; however, its functional characteristics have remained enigmatic. Here, we describe the kinetic and regulatory features of recombinant human HKDC1, demonstrating it to be a robust hexokinase (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub> = 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) with a unique glucose <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value (0.49 ± 0.07 mM) that differs markedly from all other human hexokinase isozymes. The isolated C-terminal domain of HKDC1 displays kinetic characteristics nearly identical to the full-length enzyme, whereas the N-terminal domain is inactive. Unlike all other 100 kDa vertebrate hexokinases characterized to date, HKDC1 is insensitive to product inhibition by physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate, with apparent inhibition constants above 1 mM. The hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is also insensitive to Dinaciclib, a pan cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that reportedly disrupts the ability of nuclear localized HKDC1 to phosphorylate retinoblastoma-binding protein 5. Conversely, the hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is potently inhibited by a synthetic glucosamine derivative previously developed for hexokinase 1 and 2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 103 ± 6 nM. An HKDC1 variant associated with retinitis pigmentosa, T58M, displays a modest, but statistically significant 2-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub>) compared to the wild-type enzyme. Together, our results provide a detailed functional characterization of recombinant HKDC1 and set the stage for investigating the link between HKDC1 catalysis and human disease.

[PMID: 41187174] Pitanga (Eugenia uniflora L.), a member of the Myrtaceae family, is native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and distributed across various ecological environments, including regions with contrasting edaphoclimatic conditions. Known for its production of secondary metabolites with significant biological activity, pitanga holds considerable pharmacological potential. Genomic and transcriptomic resources for this species are therefore valuable for understanding the genetic mechanisms that enable its adaptation to diverse ecosystems and for identifying candidate genes relevant for crop improvement and bioprospection. To explore whether genetic diversity is associated with population adaptation to environmental conditions, we first generated a draft genome of E. uniflora, totaling 385.1 Mbp with an N50 value of 26,199 bp, assembled de novo from Illumina-sequence reads. Likewise, gene prediction, based on Viridiplantae protein references, identified 30,663 protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics revealed 2,219 orthologous clusters, 40% of which were functionally annotated and encompassing 1,772 gene ontology terms. This draft genome also facilitated the identification of microsatellite markers, whose variation was analyzed across pitanga samples from two contrasting natural environments: Restinga and Riparian forest. The microsatellite profile showed a natural bias towards monomeric repeats, with genetic diversity differences across both populations that could be used as molecular markers for phenotype selection and plant breeding. Furthermore, RNA sequencing coupled with a Transcriptogram approach revealed significant differences in gene expression between the two populations. Pitangas from the Restinga ecosystem exhibited a stronger stress response, with distinct gene expression patterns associated with osmoprotection, cell wall modification, detoxification, nutrient balance, and epigenetic regulation. These patterns are likely linked to enhanced adaptation to the water and osmotic stress conditions, characteristic of this environment. Together, these findings enhance our knowledge of genetic diversity within E. uniflora populations and the molecular basis of their environmental adaptability. Such insights are critical for understanding how plants rapidly adapt to climate change and how these adaptations affect population dynamics, important for conservation strategies, population management, and the development of resilient cultivars.

[PMID: 41186891] Aortitis and periaortitis include a heterogeneous group of conditions, which may be idiopathic or secondary to infectious diseases or non-infectious inflammatory disorders. Therefore, treatment differ considerably depending on the underlying cause. Our aim was to assess the administered treatment and therapeutic response in a wide series of patients with aortitis and periaortitis from a single reference University center. Retrospective and observational study of patients with aortitis and/or periaortitis from a referral center in Northern Spain. The main outcomes include: clinical remission (absence of clinical symptoms), complete remission (absence of clinical symptoms and analytical normalization), and imaging remission (absence of clinical symptoms and normalization of imaging alterations). Safety data during evolution were also evaluated. We included 134 patients (87 female/47 male) (mean age: 55.1 ± 9.1 years) with 132 aortitis and two periaortitis. The main diagnostic method was the positron emission tomography (PET), showing a non-specific increase in <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake of the aorta with/without its major branches. The patients were treated with: glucocorticoids (n = 128; 95.5%), conventional immunosuppressive drugs (n = 68; 50.7%), biological therapy (n = 45; 33.5%), antibiotics (n = 3; 2.2%), and surgery (n = 6; 4.5%). After a mean follow-up of 39.2 ± 26.7 months, 72 patients (53.7%) experienced clinical remission, 64 (47.8%) complete remission and only 15 (11.2%) imaging remission. Aortitis and periaortitis are conditions that require an early diagnosis and treatment. Glucocorticoids are the first line of treatment in patients with non-infectious aortitis or periaortitis. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT scan is a useful imaging technique to evaluate the disease activity and response to therapy.

[PMID: 41186651] Progesterone, traditionally recognized for maintaining the gestational environment, also plays a pivotal immunomodulatory role essential for successful pregnancy in bovine species. This review synthesizes current understanding of progesterone-mediated immune regulation during early bovine pregnancy, focusing on its molecular mechanisms. These include genomic pathways involving nuclear progesterone receptors, non-genomic signaling through membrane progesterone receptors and progesterone receptor membrane component 1, and immunoregulatory effects mediated by the progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF). Progesterone acts both locally at the maternal-fetal interface and systemically, shaping immune tolerance and protecting the developing conceptus. Locally, it promotes an anti-inflammatory microenvironment by expanding regulatory T cells, reducing the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, and suppressing dendritic cell activation. It downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, while upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-4 and interleukin-10. Additionally, progesterone inhibits the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway, thereby attenuating inflammatory responses. PIBF contributes by enhancing T helper 2 cytokine profiles and reducing cytotoxic activity. Emerging evidence also suggests that progesterone modulates immune function in peripheral organs, including the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, indicating systemic immunoregulation. However, species-specific differences in receptor expression, signaling cascades, and immune cell responsiveness remain poorly understood. Addressing these gaps is essential for optimizing reproductive management in cattle. In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of progesterone's immunological roles may lead to improved fertility outcomes and advance knowledge of maternal-fetal immune tolerance in ruminants.

[PMID: 41186466] Background Assessing nipple involvement in breast cancer at preoperative imaging is crucial for nipple-preserving surgery, but no studies have investigated the utility of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) in this assessment. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CEM in ruling in pathologic nipple involvement and identify associated CEM features. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer treated with primary surgery who underwent preoperative CEM at five referral centers between December 2016 and December 2023. After local image review by board-certified breast radiologists (with ≥5 years of experience), CEM diagnostic accuracy indexes to rule in nipple involvement (specificity [ie, primary end point], positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratio) were calculated with surgical pathologic findings serving as the reference standard. Associations of CEM features with pathologic nipple involvement and the minimum enhancement-to-nipple distance to rule in pathologic nipple involvement were evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratios [ORs]) and the Youden index. Results Pathologic nipple involvement was present in 147 of 558 (26.3%) cancers from 530 included women (median age, 63.7 years; IQR, 50.4-73.6 years). CEM specificity was 95.1% (391 of 411; 95% CI: 92.6, 97.0), with a positive predictive value of 83.5% (101 of 121; 95% CI: 76.5, 88.7) and a positive likelihood ratio of 14.1 (95% CI: 9.1, 22.0). CEM features associated with pathologic nipple involvement were as follows: periareolar skin thickening (OR, 3.8; 95% CI: 1.7, 8.4; <i>P</i> < .001), disrupted superficial linear enhancement (OR, 3.0; 95% CI: 1.3, 7.0; <i>P</i> = .01), nipple retraction (OR, 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.6; <i>P</i> = .03), and (with lower odds) 1-mm increases in the minimum enhancement-to-nipple distance (OR, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.96; <i>P</i> < .001). For the minimum enhancement-to-nipple distance, a 9.5-mm cutoff best predicted pathologic nipple involvement (Youden index, 0.53). Conclusion CEM was able to help accurately rule in pathologic nipple involvement in the preoperative setting. <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> © RSNA, 2025.

[PMID: 41186405] The <i>Mesorhizobium nre</i> (nickel resistance) operon has previously been shown to mediate Ni tolerance in serpentine soils with naturally high concentrations of this transition metal. In most serpentine-derived strains evaluated, the putative efflux genes <i>nreX</i> and <i>nreY</i> are conserved, along with a small gene (<i>nreA</i>) encoding a CsoR/RcnR-family transcriptional regulator. CsoR/RcnR-family regulators are small (around 100 amino acids in length); they bind transition metals; and they use an unconventional and poorly understood DNA-binding mechanism. NreA is 93 amino acids in length and belongs to a poorly characterized clade within the CsoR/RcnR family. This investigation is focused on regulatory DNA elements that functionally interact with <i>Mesorhizobium</i> NreA, as well as amino acid residues in NreA that influence its regulatory activity. We show that NreA is a transcriptional repressor that is responsive to exogenous Ni. The Ni-responsive promoter is immediately upstream of the <i>nreAXY</i> operon, resulting in a leaderless transcript. An operator sequence with dyad symmetry occupies the spacer region between the -35 and -10 promoter elements. Mutational analysis of this operator highlights functionally crucial base pairs occupying opposite ends of the 19 bp element. Changes to conserved residues in the NreA polypeptide result in varying effects, with changes predicted to prevent Ni binding leading to a super-repressor phenotype. Structural modeling of the NreA-operator complex provides a plausible mechanism for DNA binding by a tetrameric form of NreA, with DNA contact sites along a positively charged surface. The modeled contact sites agree well with the mutational analysis. Bacteria employ diverse mechanisms for maintaining optimal intracellular levels of bioactive metals. Isolates of <i>Mesorhizobium</i> bacteria from Ni-rich serpentine soils possess a small genetic region controlling Ni efflux. This region is subject to transcriptional regulation via the small repressor protein NreA. In this work, the essential components of the NreA protein and the DNA operator with which it interacts are defined, enabling potential adaptation of this system for metal sensing or other technologies requiring a compact inducible gene expression module.

[PMID: 41186400] The actinomycete <i>Actinoplanes missouriensis</i> grows as a substrate mycelium and forms terminal sporangia containing a few hundred spores surrounded by an unidentified matrix called the sporangium matrix. Upon contact with water, sporangia release spores through a process called sporangium dehiscence, in which the opaque sporangium envelope becomes transparent, and sporangia swell with water, followed by spore release via the breakage of the outer envelope. In this study, we identified two paralogous hydrolases (GimA and GimB) required for sporangium dehiscence. Transcription of <i>gimA</i> and <i>gimB</i> is activated during sporangium dehiscence by a global transcriptional activator, TcrA. GimA and GimB are composed of an N-terminal signal peptide, glycoside hydrolase domain, and galactose-binding-like domain. No phenotypic changes were observed between the wild-type strain and single-gene null mutants of <i>gimA</i> and <i>gimB</i>. The double mutant (Δ<i>gimA</i>Δ<i>gimB</i> strain) formed normal sporangia, but spores were not released under dehiscence-inducing conditions; the sporangium envelope became transparent, but spores remained in the sporangium matrix. The release of spores from Δ<i>gimA</i>Δ<i>gimB</i> sporangia was immediately induced by the exogenous addition of recombinant GimA or GimB. Thin-layer chromatography revealed that GimA and GimB cleaved the substrate polysaccharide at different positions. Null mutants of genes within a putative polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster adjacent to <i>gimB</i> generated distorted sporangia, and no sporangium matrix was produced in one of the mutants. We conclude that a major component of the sporangium matrix is a polysaccharide consisting of repeating oligosaccharides and that GimA and GimB hydrolyze this polysaccharide to release spores during sporangium dehiscence.IMPORTANCEDispersal by means of zoospores is a common feature in the life cycle of many lower eukaryotes, including chytrid fungi, oomycetes, and some bacteria of actinomycetes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zoospore release from (zoo)sporangia remain largely unknown. Here, we revealed that two paralogous glycoside hydrolases (GimA and GimB) play essential roles in the release of spores, which can swim in aquatic environments as zoospores, from sporangia in <i>Actinoplanes missouriensis</i>, a filamentous soil-inhabiting bacterium. During sporangium dehiscence, GimA and GimB are produced and secreted extracellularly to hydrolyze the polysaccharide component of the sporangium matrix that encapsulates the spores. This study clarifies an unprecedented molecular mechanism in the process of zoospore release from the sporangia.

[PMID: 41186200] Harnessing information from maternal blood to predict fetal growth is an emerging area of research in livestock production, offering a noninvasive tool to monitor development. This study aimed to investigate temporal changes in blood gene expression during cow gestation through a bioinformatic approach and to determine the association between transcriptomic modifications in maternal blood at day 63 of gestation and calf birth weight (BW). Publicly available gene datasets from gestational days 0, 21, 42, 56, 63, and 105 were integrated to investigate maternal gene expression changes across gestation. Coexpression clustering identified four clusters, with three enriched for relevant biological processes, including interferon response genes from day 0 to 21, oxidative phosphorylation at day 42, and immune response genes by day 105. Additionally, maternal blood samples from 20 recipient cows carrying female fetuses derived from in vitro-produced embryos were subjected to RNA sequencing. Unsupervised weighted gene co-expression network analysis of these data identified four modules of coexpressed genes correlated with calf BW (p < 0.05). Supervised analysis revealed 189 differentially expressed genes (DEG; FDR < 0.05) associated with calf BW. The 106 positively associated DEG enriched phosphorylation and protein modification, while the 83 negatively associated DEG enriched immune processes. Biomarker genes were best determined using genes affected by gestational age and DEG, yielding 26 and 17 biomarkers, respectively, with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.88 and 0.75 for predicting calf BW. In conclusion, transcriptomic analysis of the maternal blood identified biomarkers associated with calf BW and may have application in other species.

[PMID: 41186192] Adipocytes undergo dramatic changes during to support the development of the mammary gland. However, their precise role and mechanism of action in pregnancy and lactation remain poorly understood. To explore how adipocyte elimination influences alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in the mammary gland, we mated mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) to those bearing the adiponectin (adipoq) cre. Using this mouse model of inducible and transient adipocyte ablation, we demonstrated that adipocyte loss promotes early development of AECs. During pregnancy, adipocyte loss induces activation of STAT5 through integrin β1/RAC1, which promotes early differentiation of AECs. During lactation, adipocyte loss results in upregulation of TGFβ/WNT5A expression, thereby triggering early apoptosis of AECs. Collectively, our findings reveal an unanticipated, stage-specific regulatory function of adipocytes in orchestrating AECs development during pregnancy and lactation.",10

The most common route of intoxication is oral ingestion, and parenteral poisoning is respectively rare. A 39-year-old illicit abuser of heroin and amphetamine injected 0.5 mL of 24% paraquat directly into his right cephalic vein due to hallucination. The patient was brought to our emergency department for management 4 hours after injection. He was fully conscious and had normal vital signs. Systemic review showed mild dyspnea, abdominal pain and right wrist pain over the injection site. The only abnormal physical finding was erythema over the injection site and epigastric tenderness. Laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver and renal function, and electrolytes initially yielded normal results. Urinalysis showed normal findings except a positive urine paraquat test (4+). The initial plasma paraquat concentration was 0.51 μg/mL. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent one session of charcoal hemoperfusion therapy. Acute kidney injury developed on the fourth day after intoxication, with the level of serum creatinine rising rapidly from 0.96 to 4.57 mg/dL and the daily urine output decreased noticeably from > 2000 to 900 mL. The serum creatinine level improved gradually with adequate fluid supplementation. The patient was discharged 13 days later in a stable condition. Intravenous paraquat intoxication is rare. Patients who suffer from intravenous intoxication may not directly suffer from mucosal irritation, but the clinical onset of systemic effects is more immediate and lethal. The prognosis of paraquat poisoning is determined by the time of poisoning and the plasma paraquat concentration before treatment. Proudfoot's curve provides a simple method of predicting the survival rate. The most effective mode of management is extracorporeal therapy, and immunosuppressive or antioxidant therapies have shown insufficient evidence of benefit.

[PMID: 41187384] Treatment for gaming disorder (GD) can be challenging due to comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

[PMID: 41187375] To compare cost-effectiveness of targeted therapeutic strategies for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHB) patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage endometrial cancer. A Markov-based cost-utility model using a third-party payer perspective compared concurrent and maintenance treatment strategies incorporating dostarlimab and trastuzumab for newly diagnosed stage III-IV endometrial cancer: chemotherapy alone; 3 universal immunotherapy strategies (universal concurrent and maintenance dostarlimab +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu-positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas); and 3 targeted immunotherapy strategies (dostarlimab for mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas). Costs (2024 USD), utilities, and clinical estimates were derived from published literature and the National Cancer Database. The base case analysis was a microsimulation with 10,000 runs, accompanied by a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 20,000 trials. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We performed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses on key parameters and analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. All targeted immunotherapy strategies were cost-effective compared to chemotherapy alone in both NHB and NHW, while universal immunotherapy was never cost-effective. Targeted strategies were more cost-effective in NHB than NHW. Targeted dostarlimab for dMMR plus trastuzumab for HER2 serous and carcinosarcomas was the most cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy, with an ICER of $119,945/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, assuming longer durations of treatment benefit resulted in lower ICERs. Personalized treatment strategies incorporating HER2 and MMR testing should be considered to optimize both cost-effectiveness and equity in care.

[PMID: 41187360] In porous polyethylene (PPE)-based microtia reconstruction, achieving an esthetically contoured ear remains a surgical challenge owing to complex soft tissue placement and need for seamless skin coverage. Although autologous techniques have standardized incision patterns, no systematic approach exists for alloplastic procedures. We propose a subtype-specific skin incision algorithm for PPE-based microtia reconstruction to improve esthetic outcomes, standardize surgical planning, and evaluate clinical effectiveness. This analysis included 15 patients (16 ears) who underwent PPE-based auricular reconstruction between October 2023 and June 2024. Incision types were selected using a subtype-specific algorithm: midline incisions for grade 1-3 microtia and perimastoid incisions for grade 4 and bilateral cases. Adult and pediatric patients were assessed preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) and Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory (GCBI), respectively. All patients were evaluated using the Auricular Reconstruction Evaluation Scale at 6 months. Among the 16 reconstructed ears, 9 and 7 underwent midline and perimastoid incisions, respectively. GBI and GCBI scores improved significantly postoperatively (p = 0.041 and p = 0.002, respectively). Preoperatively, GCBI scores were significantly lower than GBI scores (p = 0.002). The median evaluation scores included overall appearance (4.29 [IQR 4.17-4.43]), esthetic subunits (4.00 [IQR 3.95-4.20]), donor-site outcome (4.40 [IQR 4.20-4.60]), and psychosocial satisfaction (4.80 [IQR 4.70-4.90]). The proposed incision algorithm improves esthetic and psychosocial outcomes in PPE-based microtia reconstruction by reducing the need for skin grafts and preserving postauricular sulcus depth, thereby offering a practical and reproducible strategy for surgical planning. Therapeutic, IV.

[PMID: 41187359] Virtual surgical planning (VSP) has revolutionized the field of maxillofacial reconstruction. Traditionally, VSP is outsourced to an external company, which can incur considerable costs and delay surgery. Our institution has previously reported on the feasibility of point-of-care VSP (POC-VSP). Here, we present an update on the technical refinements made to our POC-VSP process, and provide an expanded series with specific endpoints including time from planning to product release, operative time, implant survival, and post-operative complications. A retrospective cohort study of all maxillomandibular reconstructions performed with POC-VSP from August 2016 to February 2024 was conducted. Data were extracted from the prospectively maintained Integrated Prosthetics & Reconstruction database. Outcomes including the time from the VSP planning session to product release for cases performed within the last 12 months, operative time, dental implant survival, and post-operative complications were evaluated. Fifty patients underwent maxillofacial reconstruction with POC-VSP. The median number of cases performed per annum was 4.5 (range, 2-15). The most common indications were oral squamous cell carcinoma (n=23) and ameloblastoma (n=11). The fibula (n=39) was the most common donor site. The median time from the VSP session to product release was 15.5 days (range, 9-27 days). The mean operative time was 565 min (range, 366-972 min). The implant success rate was 95%. Seven patients experienced a Clavien-Dindo grade III or IV post-operative complication necessitating a return to theater. POC-VSP is a feasible process which provides acceptable operative time parameters and implant success rates. Optical scans of pre-bent plates can be incorporated into POC-VSP to guide plate fixation. Further research is required to quantify the cost benefit of POC-VSP.

[PMID: 41187318] Synchronous oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a unique clinical entity with potential benefit from radical local consolidative therapy (LCT). However, robust tools to stratify patients most likely to benefit from radical LCT are lacking. We identified patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC from the SEER 17 registry (2018-2021). Radical LCT was defined as surgical resection of the primary tumor (±metastasectomy) and/or radiotherapy. Patients were stratified accordingly. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox models with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding. A weighted random survival forest (RSF) model and SHAP analysis were applied to capture nonlinear interactions and key prognostic determinants. Model discrimination was assessed by C-index, AUC, and integrated Brier score (IBS). Among 5,377 patients, 221 received radical LCT. The radical LCT group was younger, had earlier T stage, smaller tumors, and more frequent brain metastases. Median overall survival (mOS) was significantly longer in the radical LCT group than the no-LCT group (27 vs. 7 months; p<0.001), with maximal benefit among those also receiving chemotherapy (mOS: 30 months). The RSF model outperformed Cox regression in training (C-index: 0.752 vs. 0.735) with similar validation results. Chemotherapy (HR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.36-0.46; p<0.001) and radical LCT (HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.91; p = 0.018) were independent favorable factors. SHAP analysis demonstrated that radical LCT and chemotherapy contributed most to risk reduction in the survival prediction model, with consistent protective effects observed across different age, T stage, and histological subgroups. This multi-center, population-based study is the first to establish and internally validate a machine learning-based risk stratification tool for patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC. Radical LCT, particularly when combined with chemotherapy, was associated with improved OS in this cohort. The model may facilitate preliminary risk stratification and assist multidisciplinary management, but external validation and integration of key clinical and molecular variables are needed before clinical application. Prospective multicenter validation is warranted.

[PMID: 41187261] Human-centered design (HCD) is vital for crafting impactful and successful health interventions. This approach has been effective in enhancing the uptake of health services, especially in rural areas. The Routine Immunization Buddy System (RIBS) is an HCD-driven intervention designed to support economically disadvantaged caregivers by empowering them to take greater responsibility for their own health and the immunization of their children. Through a community-based participatory research (CBPR), this study seeks to understand the economic, social, and health lifestyles and the impact on the health-seeking attributes of the potential beneficiaries of the project. This ensures that the identified intervention and its strategy will be implemented in a way that is of utmost benefit to the users. Using a 3-step HCD process-discovery, ideation, and formulation-the study conducted focus group discussions and key informant interviews for caregivers and stakeholders capable of influencing the woman's decision within a health setting. Semistructured interviews facilitated an in-depth exploration of participants' experiences. Data collection used audio and video recordings, detailed notes, and observation sessions. Data analysis encompassed transcription, descriptive analysis, and thematic analysis to inform evidence-based interventions. Four key interconnected barriers to routine immunization were identified from the formative research: (1) vaccine hesitancy, which is driven by safety concerns and inconsistency in vaccine-related messaging; (2) gender-based decision-making constraints, where male approval often influenced access to care; (3) financial limitations affecting transport and medical costs; and (4) unequal access to health care due to geographic disparities. Caregivers emphasized the need for economic empowerment and trusted community-based health education. These findings informed a critical redesign of the intervention from a 2-arm to a 3-arm model, with peer support groups and financial empowerment components added to address both economic barriers and vaccine misinformation through culturally tailored approaches. The use of HCD-informed formative research has helped identify tailored women's empowerment strategies, such as economic support, community-led advocacy, and peer networks, that show promise in addressing health disparities among caregivers. These approaches are hoped to enhance caregivers' ability to make informed health decisions, ultimately contributing to improved immunization uptake and broader community well-being. The insights from this research are actively informing the design of our upcoming cluster randomized controlled trial, which aims to strengthen women's decision-making power around immunization services.

[PMID: 41187250] Antibiotics remain a cornerstone in the management of dermatologic conditions such as acne and hidradenitis suppurativa, underscoring the need for responsible antibiotic stewardship. This article explores the &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; of antibiotics, highlighting their role in disrupting the gut microbiome, elevating risks for infections like Clostridium difficile, and increasing resistance in Cutibacterium acnes and other microbes. Emerging evidence also links antibiotic use to reduced vaccine efficacy and diminished responses to cancer immunotherapy. To mitigate these risks, dermatologists should prioritize narrow-spectrum antibiotics and incorporate combination topical therapies containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO), such as the triple-combination of clindamycin, adapalene, and BPO, to help curb antibiotic resistance. Prudent antibiotic use, combined with topical regimens utilizing BPO, optimizes treatment outcomes while minimizing systemic adverse effects and resistance. Ongoing education and research are essential to refine prescribing practices that balance therapeutic benefits with long-term patient and public health.

[PMID: 41187240] Nicotinamide (niacinamide) is the water-soluble form of vitamin B3. Nicotinamide plays a crucial physiological role as a catalyst for various molecular reactions in the body and is a common over-the-counter supplement. In dermatology, oral nicotinamide has a long history of diverse applications. Oral nicotinamide mitigates ultraviolet-induced immunosuppression, serves as adjunctive therapy for blistering skin disorders, reduces inflammation and sebum in acne vulgaris, and has been used for pruritic disorders. Recent studies indicate that terminal metabolites of nicotinamide may contribute to vascular inflammation and elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly at doses exceeding therapeutic recommendations of 500 mg. Given the wide range of applications of nicotinamide in dermatology, we aim to investigate the effects of oral nicotinamide on cardiovascular health. A review of the literature was conducted to assess the dermatological benefits of oral nicotinamide as well as its potential cardiovascular risks, particularly at high doses. Evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses was evaluated to synthesize current knowledge on its safety and efficacy. Oral nicotinamide has demonstrated significant benefits in dermatological practice, including reducing the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers in immunocompetent individuals and improving outcomes in various inflammatory skin conditions. However, recent evidence suggests that increased serum levels of nicotinamide's terminal metabolites N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide leads to increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular effects. While oral nicotinamide remains a valuable option in dermatological practice, clinicians should exercise caution in prescribing this at high doses due to the potential cardiovascular risks.

Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment increases brown adipose tissue activity.,Chenodeoxycholic acid AND activity AND brown adipose tissue AND thermogenesis,"37916301,37122689,32655675,27634226,27488269,24310401,41187382,41187379,41187370,41187369","[PMID: 37916301] Individuals with rotating and night shift work are highly susceptible to developing metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. This is primarily attributed to disruptions in the circadian rhythms caused by activities and irregular eating habits. Time-restricted feeding (tRF) limits the daily eating schedules and has been demonstrated to markedly improve several metabolic disorders. Although an intricate relationship exists between tRF and circadian rhythms, the underlying specific mechanism remains elusive. We used a sleep disruption device for activity interference and established a model of circadian rhythm disorder in mice with different genetic backgrounds. We found that circadian rhythm disruption led to abnormal hormone secretion in the gut and elevated insulin resistance. tRF improved metabolic abnormalities caused by circadian rhythm disruption, primarily by restoring the gut hormone secretion rhythm and activating brown fat thermogenesis. The crucial function of brown fat in tRF was confirmed using a mouse model with brown fat removal. We demonstrated that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) effectively improved circadian rhythm disruption-induced metabolic disorders by restoring brown fat activation. Our findings demonstrate the potential benefits of CDCA in reversing metabolic disadvantages associated with irregular circadian rhythms.

[PMID: 37122689] Although fat loss is observed in patients with cholestasis, how chronically elevated bile acids (BAs) impact white and brown fat depots remains obscure. To determine the direct effect of pathological levels of BAs on lipid accumulation and mitochondrial function, primary white and brown adipocyte cultures along with fat depots from two separate mouse models of cholestatic liver diseases, namely (i) genetic deletion of farnesoid X receptor (<i>Fxr</i>); small heterodimer (<i>Shp</i>) double knockout (DKO) and (ii) injury by 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), were used. As expected, cholestatic mice accumulate high systemic BA levels and exhibit fat loss. Here, we demonstrate that chronic exposure to pathological BA levels results in mitochondrial dysfunction and defective thermogenesis. Consistently, both DKO and DDC-fed mice exhibit lower body temperature. Importantly, thermoneutral (30 °C) housing of the cholestatic DKO mice rescues the decrease in brown fat mass, and the expression of genes responsible for lipogenesis and regulation of mitochondrial function. To overcome systemic effects, primary adipocyte cultures were treated with pathological BA concentrations. Mitochondrial permeability and respiration analysis revealed that BA overload is sufficient to reduce mitochondrial function in primary adipocytes, which is not as a result of cytotoxicity. Instead, we found robust reductions in uncoupling protein 1 (<i>Ucp1</i>), PR domain containing 16 (<i>Prdm16</i>)<i>,</i> and deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II (<i>Dio2</i>) transcripts in brown adipocytes upon treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, whereas taurocholic acid led to the suppression of <i>Dio2</i> transcript. This BA-mediated decrease in transcripts was alleviated by pharmacological activation of UCP1. High concentrations of BAs cause defective thermogenesis by reducing the expression of crucial regulators of mitochondrial function, including UCP1, which may explain the clinical features of hypothermia and fat loss observed in patients with cholestatic liver diseases. We uncover a detrimental effect of chronic bile acid overload on adipose mitochondrial function. Pathological concentration of different BAs reduces the expression of distinct genes involved in energy expenditure, which can be mitigated with pharmacological UCP1 activation.

[PMID: 32655675] The gut microbiota plays a critical role in obesity and lipid metabolism disorder. Chokeberry (<i>Aronia melanocarpa</i> L<i>.</i>) are rich in polyphenols with various physiological and pharmacological activities. We determined serum physiological parameters and fecal microbial components by using related kits, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing every 10 days. Real-time PCR analysis was used to measure gene expression of bile acids (BAs) and lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissues. We analyzed the effects of different Chokeberry polyphenol (CBPs) treatment time on obesity and lipid metabolism in high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. The results indicated that CBPs treatment prevents obesity, liver steatosis and improves dyslipidemia in HFD-fed rats. CBPs modulated the composition of the gut microbiota with the extended treatment time, reducing the <i>Firmicutes</i>/<i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio (F/B ratio) and increasing the relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i> and other bacterial species associated with anti-obesity properties. We found that CBPs treatment gradually decreased the total BAs pool and particularly reduced the relative content of cholic acid (CA), deoxycholic acid (DCA) and enhanced the relative content of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). These changes were positively correlated <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotella</i> and negatively correlated with <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>Eubacterium</i>, <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>. In liver and white adipose tissues, the gene expression of lipogenesis, lipolysis and BAs metabolism were regulated after CBPs treatment in HFD-fed rats, which was most likely mediated through FXR and TGR-5 signaling pathway to improve lipid metabolism. In addition, the mRNA expression of PPARγ, UCP1 and PGC-1α were upregulated markedly in interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) after CBPs treatment. We confirmed that CBPs could reduce the body weight of HFD-fed rats by accelerating energy homeostasis and thermogenesis in iBAT. Finally, the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment results demonstrated that FMT from CBPs-treated rats failed to reduce the weight of HFD-fed rats. However, FMT from CBPs-treated rats improved dyslipidemia and reshaped gut microbiota in HFD-fed rats. In conclusion, CBPs treatment improved obesity and complications by regulating gut microbiota in HFD-fed rats. The gut microbiota plays an important role in BAs metabolism after CBPs treatment, and BAs have therefore emerged as major effectors in microbe-host signaling events that influence host lipid metabolism, energy metabolism and thermogenesis.

[PMID: 27634226] The chaperone GRP78/BiP (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein) modulates protein folding in reply to cellular insults that lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study investigated the role of hypothalamic GRP78 on energy balance, with particular interest in thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, we used diet-induced obese rats and rats administered thapsigargin, and by combining metabolic, histologic, physiologic, pharmacologic, thermographic, and molecular techniques, we studied the effect of genetic manipulation of hypothalamic GRP78. Our data showed that rats fed a high-fat diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and metabolic phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors. This evidence indicates that modulation of hypothalamic GRP78 activity may be a potential strategy against obesity and associated comorbidities.

[PMID: 27488269] Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, and associated pathologies, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular alterations, are increasingly escalating morbidity and mortality. Despite intensive study, no effective simple treatment for these conditions exists. As such, the need for go-to drugs is serious. Bile acids (BAs) present the possibility of reversing these problems, as various in vivo studies and clinical trials have shown significant effects with regard to weight and obesity reduction, insulin sensitivity restoration and cardiovascular improvements. However, the mechanism of action of BA-induced metabolic improvement has yet to be fully established. The currently most accepted model involves non-shivering thermogenesis for energy waste, but this is disputed. As such, we propose to determine whether the BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) can exert anti-obesogenic effects in vitro, independent of thermogenic brown adipose tissue activation. By exposing differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes to high glucose and CDCA, we demonstrate that this BA has anti-obesity effects in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of metabolic pathways clearly indicates an improvement in metabolic status, as these cells become more oxidative rather than glycolytic, which may be associated with an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Our work demonstrates that CDCA-induced metabolic alterations occur in white and brown adipocytes and are not totally dependent on endocrine/nervous system signaling, as thought until now. Furthermore, future exploration of the mechanisms behind these effects will undoubtedly reveal interesting targets for clinical modulation.

[PMID: 24310401] Besides their role in lipid absorption, bile acids (BAs) can act as signalling molecules. Cholic acid was shown to counteract obesity and associated metabolic disorders in high-fat-diet (cHF)-fed mice while enhancing energy expenditure through induction of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and activation of non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In this study, the effects of another natural BA, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), on dietary obesity, UCP1 in both interscapular BAT and in white adipose tissue (brite cells in WAT), were characterized in dietary-obese mice. To induce obesity and associated metabolic disorders, male 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice were fed cHF (35% lipid wt wt(-1), mainly corn oil) for 4 months. Mice were then fed either (i) for 8 weeks with cHF or with cHF with two different doses (0.5%, 1%; wt wt(-1)) of CDCA (8-week reversion); or (ii) for 3 weeks with cHF or with cHF with 1% CDCA, or pair-fed (PF) to match calorie intake of the CDCA mice fed ad libitum; mice on standard chow diet were also used (3-week reversion). In the 8-week reversion, the CDCA intervention resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of obesity, dyslipidaemia and glucose intolerance, which could be largely explained by a transient decrease in food intake. The 3-week reversion revealed mild CDCA-dependent and food intake-independent induction of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in interscapular BAT, negligible increase of UCP1 in subcutaneous WAT and a shift from carbohydrate to lipid oxidation. CDCA could reverse obesity in cHF-fed mice, mainly in response to the reduction in food intake, an effect probably occuring but neglected in previous studies using cholic acid. Nevertheless, CDCA-dependent and food intake-independent induction of UCP1 in BAT (but not in WAT) could contribute to the reduction in adiposity and to the stabilization of the lean phenotype.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187370] An improved route to the indolequinone pharmacophore is described based on the reaction of bromobenzoquinones with enamines. Through the implementation of small changes in the reaction conditions, the reaction conditions were much improved with quantities of copper salt, base, and acetonitrile solvent all reduced compared with the original method. The resulting indolequinone-3-carboxylates were subsequently converted into novel indolequinones as potential inhibitors of the quinone reductase enzyme NQO2. A number of potent, mechanism-based inhibitors were identified, increasing our understanding of structure-activity relationships for inhibition of this enzyme.

[PMID: 41187369] Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with limited and often toxic treatment options. This study explores the antileishmanial potential of N-substituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridine derivatives through combined in vitro and in silico approaches. Initially, N-Boc-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine (2a-i) and N-Boc-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine (1a-f) derivatives were synthesized and evaluated against Leishmania amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. infantum, and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Only N-Boc-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine derivatives with substituted nitrogen at position 6 (2b, 2c, 2f, 2g) were active (IC₅₀ < 10 μM). Based on this, a series of N-benzyl-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine analogs (3a-i) was synthesized, with compounds 3c, 3f, and 3g showing improved antipromastigote activity and selectivity índices (SI). Notably, compound 3f demonstrated potent amastigote activities (IC₅₀ between 0.83 and 1.13 μM), comparable to amphotericin B, but with a 250-fold higher SI and low in vivo toxicity (LD₅₀ = 2000 mg/kg in Zophobas morio). Physicochemical and pharmacokinetic predictions using SwissADME and Osiris indicated favorable drug-like properties and oral bioavailability for 3f. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed strong binding affinities to Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase (NDK) (PDB: 5GO1), Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) (PDB: 4WZH), and Sterol 14α-Demethylase (CYP51) (PDB: 3L4D), surpassing reference ligands, with stable complexes, key catalytic site interactions, low RMSD, compact Radius of gyration, and reduced RMSF, supporting their potential as conformationally stable and specific enzyme inhibitors for leishmaniasis treatment. Altogether, these findings strongly highlight the potential of N-substituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridine as promising scaffolds for antileishmanial drug development and highlight compound 3f as a lead candidate for further optimization.",10

We investigated the individual and combined effects of malaria and curable STIs/RTIs on fetal growth in Kenya, Tanzania, and Malawi. This study was nested within a randomized trial comparing monthly intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine vs dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, alone or combined with azithromycin. Fetal weight gain was assessed by serial prenatal ultrasound. Malaria was assessed monthly, and Treponema pallidum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, and bacterial vaginosis at enrollment and in the third trimester. The effect of malaria and STIs/RTIs on fetal weight/birthweight Z-scores was evaluated using mixed-effects linear regression. In total, 1435 pregnant women had fetal/birth weight assessed 3950 times. Compared to women without malaria or STIs/RTIs (n = 399), malaria-only (n = 267), STIs/RTIs only (n = 410) or both (n = 353) were associated with reduced fetal growth (adjusted mean difference in fetal/birth weight Z-score [95% confidence interval]: malaria = -0.18 [-0.31,-0.04], P = 0.01; STIs/RTIs = -0.14 [-0.26,-0.03], P = 0.01; both = -0.20 [-0.33,-0.07], P = 0.003). Paucigravidae experienced the greatest impact. Malaria and STIs/RTIs are associated with poor fetal growth especially among paucigravidae women with dual infections. Integrated antenatal interventions are needed to reduce the burden of both malaria and STIs/RTIs.

[PMID: 34050737] Chlamydia trachomatis causes pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal infertility. Plasmid gene protein 3 antibody (Pgp3Ab) detects prior chlamydial infections. We evaluated for an association of high chlamydial seropositivity with sequelae using a Pgp3Ab multiplex bead array (Pgp3AbMBA). We performed chlamydia Pgp3AbMBA on sera from women 18-39 years old participating in the 2013-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with urine chlamydia nucleic acid amplification test results. High chlamydial seropositivity was defined as a median fluorescence intensity (MFI ≥ 50 000; low-positive was MFI > 551-<50 000. Weighted US population high-positive, low-positive, and negative Pgp3Ab chlamydia seroprevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were compared for women with chlamydial infection, self-reported PID, and infertility. Of 2339 women aged 18-39 years, 1725 (73.7%) had sera, and 1425 were sexually experienced. Overall, 104 women had high positive Pgp3Ab (5.4% [95% CI 4.0-7.0] of US women); 407 had lowpositive Pgp3Ab (25.1% [95% CI 21.5-29.0]), and 914 had negative Pgp3Ab (69.5% [95% CI 65.5-73.4]). Among women with high Pgp3Ab, infertility prevalence was 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.7) times higher than among Pgp3Ab-negative women (19.6% [95% CI 10.5-31.7] versus 9.9% [95% CI 7.7-12.4]). For women with low Pgp3Ab, PID prevalence was 7.9% (95% CI 4.6-12.6) compared to 2.3% (95% CI 1.4-3.6) in negative Pgp3Ab. High chlamydial Pgp3Ab seropositivity was associated with infertility although small sample size limited evaluation of an association of high seropositivity with PID. In infertile women, Pgp3Ab may be a marker of prior chlamydial infection.

[PMID: 31998566] Gini coefficients have been used to describe the distribution of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> (CT) infections among individuals with different levels of sexual activity. The objectives of this study were to investigate Gini coefficients for different sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and to determine how STI control interventions might affect the Gini coefficient over time. We used population-based data for sexually experienced women from two British National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-2: 1999-2001; Natsal-3: 2010-2012) to calculate Gini coefficients for CT, <i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> (MG), and human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18. We applied bootstrap methods to assess uncertainty and to compare Gini coefficients for different STIs. We then used a mathematical model of STI transmission to study how control interventions affect Gini coefficients. Gini coefficients for CT and MG were 0.33 (95% CI [0.18-0.49]) and 0.16 (95% CI [0.02-0.36]), respectively. The relatively small coefficient for MG suggests a longer infectious duration compared with CT. The coefficients for HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 ranged from 0.15 to 0.38. During the decade between Natsal-2 and Natsal-3, the Gini coefficient for CT did not change. The transmission model shows that higher STI treatment rates are expected to reduce prevalence and increase the Gini coefficient of STIs. In contrast, increased condom use reduces STI prevalence but does not affect the Gini coefficient. Gini coefficients for STIs can help us to understand the distribution of STIs in the population, according to level of sexual activity, and could be used to inform STI prevention and treatment strategies.

[PMID: 30981999] Mass drug administration (MDA) of 20 mg/kg (maximum 1 g in adults) azithromycin for ocular <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> (CT) infection is a key component of the WHO trachoma elimination strategy. However, this dose may be suboptimal in <i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> infection and may encourage emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to azithromycin. To determine the effect of MDA for trachoma elimination on <i>M. genitalium</i> prevalence, strain type and azithromycin resistance. A secondary analysis of CT-negative vulvovaginal swabs from three outpatient antenatal clinics (Honiara, Solomon Islands) from patients recruited either pre-MDA, or 10 months post-MDA in two cross-sectional surveys was carried out. Swabs were tested for <i>M. genitalium</i> infection using Fast Track Diagnostics Urethritis Plus nucleic acid amplification assay. <i>M. genitalium</i>-positive samples were subsequently tested for azithromycin resistance by sequencing domain V of the 23S rRNA DNA region of <i>M. genitalium</i> and underwent phylogenetic analysis by dual locus sequence typing. <i>M. genitalium</i> prevalence was 11.9% (28/236) in women pre-MDA and 10.9% (28/256) 10 months post-MDA (p=0.7467). Self-reported receipt of azithromycin as part of MDA was 49.2% in women recruited post-MDA and 17.9% (5/28) in those who tested <i>M. genitalium</i> positive. Of samples sequenced (21/28 pre-MDA, 22/28 post-MDA), all showed a macrolide susceptible genotype. Strain typing showed that sequence types diverged into two lineages, with a suggestion of strain replacement post-MDA. A single round of azithromycin MDA in an island population with high baseline <i>M. genitalium</i> prevalence did not appear to impact on either prevalence or azithromycin resistance, in contrast to reported decreased genital CT prevalence in the same population. This may be due to limitations such as sample size, including CT-negative samples only, and low MDA coverage. Further investigation of the impact of multiple rounds of MDA on <i>M. genitalium</i> azithromycin AMR in antibiotic experienced and naïve populations is warranted.

[PMID: 30285705] Youth in southern Africa, particularly adolescent girls and young women, are a key population for HIV prevention interventions. Untreated genital tract infections (GTIs) increase both HIV transmission and acquisition risks. South African GTI treatment guidelines employ syndromic management, which relies on individuals to report GTI signs and symptoms. Syndromic management may, however, underestimate cases, particularly among youth. We compared genital tract infection (GTI) prevalence by symptom-based and laboratory assessment among sexually-experienced youth in South Africa, overall and stratified by sex. Interviewer-administered surveys assessed socio-demographics, behaviors, and GTI symptoms among 352 youth (16-24 yrs., HIV-negative or unknown HIV status at enrollment) enrolled in community-based cohorts in Durban and Soweto (2014-2016). Laboratory tests assessed HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infections and, among females, bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Candida species. Youth with genital ulcers were tested for HSV-2 and syphilis. We assessed sensitivity (and specificity) of symptom-based reporting in identifying laboratory-confirmed GTIs. At baseline, 16.2% of females (32/198) and < 1% (1/154) of males reported ≥1 GTI symptom. However, laboratory tests identified ≥1 GTI in 70.2% and 10.4%, respectively. Female CT prevalence was 18.2%, NG 7.1%, MG 9.6%, TV 8.1%, and 5.1% were newly diagnosed with HIV. BV prevalence was 53.0% and candidiasis 9.6%. One female case of herpes was identified (0 syphilis). Male CT prevalence was 7.8%, NG 1.3%, MG 3.3%, TV < 1%, and 2.0% were newly diagnosed with HIV. Overall, 77.8% of females and 100% of males with laboratory-diagnosed GTIs reported no symptoms or were asymptomatic. Sensitivity (and specificity) of symptom-based reporting was 14% (97%) among females and 0% (99%) among males. A high prevalence of asymptomatic GTIs and very poor sensitivity of symptom-based reporting undermines the applicability of syndromic GTI management, thus compromising GTI control and HIV prevention efforts among youth. Syndromic GTI management does not meet the sexual health needs of young people. Policy changes incorporating innovations in GTI diagnostic testing are needed to reduce GTIs and HIV-associated risks among youth.

[PMID: 27881530] Conduct a feasibility study on the effect of menstrual hygiene on schoolgirls' school and health (reproductive/sexual) outcomes. 3-arm single-site open cluster randomised controlled pilot study. 30 primary schools in rural western Kenya, within a Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Primary schoolgirls 14-16 years, experienced 3 menses, no precluding disability, and resident in the study area. 1 insertable menstrual cup, or monthly sanitary pads, against 'usual practice' control. All participants received puberty education preintervention, and hand wash soap during intervention. Schools received hand wash soap. Primary: school attrition (drop-out, absence); secondary: sexually transmitted infection (STI) (Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoea), reproductive tract infection (RTI) (bacterial vaginosis, Candida albicans); safety: toxic shock syndrome, vaginal Staphylococcus aureus. Of 751 girls enrolled 644 were followed-up for a median of 10.9 months. Cups or pads did not reduce school dropout risk (control=8.0%, cups=11.2%, pads=10.2%). Self-reported absence was rarely reported and not assessable. Prevalence of STIs in the end-of-study survey among controls was 7.7% versus 4.2% in the cups arm (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 0.48, 0.24 to 0.96, p=0.039), 4.5% with pads (aPR=0.62; 0.37 to 1.03, p=0.063), and 4.3% with cups and pads pooled (aPR=0.54, 0.34 to 0.87, p=0.012). RTI prevalence was 21.5%, 28.5% and 26.9% among cup, pad and control arms, 71% of which were bacterial vaginosis, with a prevalence of 14.6%, 19.8% and 20.5%, per arm, respectively. Bacterial vaginosis was less prevalent in the cups (12.9%) compared with pads (20.3%, aPR=0.65, 0.44 to 0.97, p=0.034) and control (19.2%, aPR=0.67, 0.43 to 1.04, p=0.075) arm girls enrolled for 9 months or longer. No adverse events were identified. Provision of menstrual cups and sanitary pads for ∼1 school-year was associated with a lower STI risk, and cups with a lower bacterial vaginosis risk, but there was no association with school dropout. A large-scale trial on menstrual cups is warranted. ISRCTN17486946; Results.

[PMID: 27154958] This cross-sectional study was undertaken to compare health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) in women with and without undiagnosed Chlamydia trachomatis infection. We analysed data from 2401 multi-ethnic sexually active female students aged 16-27 years who were recruited to a randomised controlled trial of chlamydia screening - the prevention of pelvic infection trial in 2004-2006. At recruitment, all participants were asked to provide self-taken vaginal swabs for chlamydia testing and to complete a sexual health questionnaire including quality of life (EQ-5D). Most women (69%) had an EQ-5D of one representing 'perfect health' in the five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. We therefore compared the proportion of women with an EQ-5D score < 1 implying 'less than perfect health' in women with and without chlamydia infection, and women with symptomatic chlamydia versus the remainder. The proportion of women with EQ-5D score < 1 was similar in women with and without undiagnosed chlamydia: 34% (47/138) versus 31% (697/2263; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.41). However, more women with symptomatic chlamydia had EQ-5D score < 1 than the remainder: 45% (25/55) versus 31% (714/2319; RR 1.47, CI 1.10 to 1.98). In this community-based study, EQ-5D scores were similar in women with and without undiagnosed chlamydia. However, a higher proportion of women with symptomatic chlamydia infection had 'less than perfect health'. Undiagnosed chlamydia infection may not have a major short-term effect on health-related quality of life, but EQ-5D may not be the best tool to measure it in this group.

[PMID: 26290483] In the context of widespread opportunistic chlamydia screening among young adults, we aimed to quantify chlamydia testing and diagnosis among 16-24 year olds in Britain in relation to risk factors for prevalent chlamydia infection. Using data from sexually experienced (≥1 lifetime sexual partner) 16-year-old to 24-year-old participants in Britain's third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (conducted 2010-2012), we explored socio-demographic and behavioural factors associated with prevalent chlamydia infection (detected in urine; n=1832), self-reported testing and self-reported diagnosis in the last year (both n=3115). Chlamydia prevalence was 3.1% (95% CI 2.2% to 4.3%) in women and 2.3% (1.5% to 3.4%) in men. A total of 12.3% of women and 5.3% men had a previous chlamydia diagnosis. Factors associated with prevalent infection were also associated with testing and diagnosis (eg, increasing numbers of sexual partners), with some exceptions. For example, chlamydia prevalence was higher in women living in more deprived areas, whereas testing was not. In men, prevalence was higher in 20-24 than 16-19 year olds but testing was lower. Thirty per cent of women and 53.7% of men with ≥2 new sexual partners in the last year had not recently tested. In 2010-2012 in Britain, the proportion of young adults reporting chlamydia testing was generally higher in those reporting factors associated with chlamydia. However, many of those with risk factors had not been recently tested, leaving potential for undiagnosed infections. Greater screening and prevention efforts among individuals in deprived areas and those reporting risk factors for chlamydia may reduce undiagnosed prevalence and transmission.

[PMID: 26083250] It is well-established that male circumcision reduces acquisition of HIV, herpes simplex virus 2, chancroid, and syphilis. However, the effect on the acquisition of non-ulcerative sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remains unclear. We examined the relationship between circumcision and biological measures of three STIs: human papillomavirus (HPV), Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium. A probability sample survey of 15,162 men and women aged 16-74 years (including 4,060 men aged 16-44 years) was carried out in Britain between 2010 and 2012. Participants completed a computer-assisted personal interview, including a computer-assisted self-interview, which asked about experience of STI diagnoses, and circumcision. Additionally, 1,850 urine samples from sexually-experienced men aged 16-44 years were collected and tested for STIs. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) to quantify associations between circumcision and i) self-reporting any STI diagnosis and ii) presence of STIs in urine, in men aged 16-44 years, adjusting for key socio-demographic and sexual behavioural factors. The prevalence of circumcision in sexually-experienced men aged 16-44 years was 17.4% (95%CI 16.0-19.0). There was no association between circumcision and reporting any previous STI diagnoses, and specifically previous chlamydia or genital warts. However, circumcised men were less likely to have any HPV type (AOR 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.50) including high-risk HPV types (HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and/or 68) (AOR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05-0.40) detected in urine. Circumcised men had reduced odds of HPV detection in urine. These findings have implications for improving the precision of models of STI transmission in populations with different circumcision prevalence and in designing interventions to reduce STI acquisition.

[PMID: 26082320] To identify risk factors for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in female students. We performed a prospective study set in 11 universities and 9 further education colleges in London. In 2004-2006, 2529 sexually experienced, multiethnic, female students, mean age 20.8 years, provided self-taken vaginal samples and completed questionnaires at recruitment to the Prevention of Pelvic Infection chlamydia screening trial. After 12 months, they were followed up by questionnaire backed by medical record search and assessed for PID by blinded genitourinary medicine physicians. Of 2004 (79%) participants who reported numbers of sexual partners during follow-up, 32 (1.6%, 95% CI 1.1% to 2.2%) were diagnosed with PID. The strongest predictor of PID was baseline Chlamydia trachomatis (relative risk (RR) 5.7, 95% CI 2.6 to 15.6). After adjustment for baseline C. trachomatis, significant predictors of PID were ≥2 sexual partners or a new sexual partner during follow-up (RR 4.0, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.5; RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.3), age <20 years (RR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 7.0), recruitment from a further education college rather than a university (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.3) and history at baseline of vaginal discharge (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.8) or pelvic pain (RR 4.1, 95% CI 2.0 to 8.3) in the previous six months. Bacterial vaginosis and Mycoplasma genitalium infection were no longer significantly associated with PID after adjustment for baseline C. trachomatis. Multiple or new partners in the last 12 months, age <20 years and attending a further education college rather than a university were risk factors for PID after adjustment for baseline C. trachomatis infection. Sexual health education and screening programmes could be targeted at these high-risk groups. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00115388).",10

The functions of miRNA-19b were assessed by phenotypic switching, proliferation, and migration of VSMCs. The target genes of miR-19b associated with proliferation and migration were revealed by analysis of TargetScan and miRanda databases and verified with luciferase assay. Experiments showed that EMPs could transfer miRNA-19b into VSMCs. Elevated content of miRNA-19b increased expression of contractile phenotypic markers SMA and SM22α and inhibited proliferation and migration of VSMCs. The direct target gene of miRNA-19b turned out to be the mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6). Thus, miRNA-19b in EMPs could inhibit phenotypic transformation of VSMCs from the contractile phenotype to synthetic one and reduce proliferation and migration by down-regulating MAPK6 expression, which can potentially inhibit the development of atherosclerosis.

[PMID: 41186671] Skin aging is a prominent manifestation of human aging, largely driven by oxidative stress and inflammation. D-limonene, a natural monoterpene, possesses strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help counteract these effects. This study aimed to explore the anti-aging and skin-rejuvenating potential of D-limonene in a mouse model of D-galactose-induced skin aging. 60 male mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 10). Group I served as the control. Group II received D-galactose (500 mg/kg) for 42 days to induce aging. Groups III and IV received vitamin C (100 mg/kg) either concurrently with D-galactose or after aging induction, respectively. Groups V and VI received D-limonene (100 mg/kg) either simultaneously with D-galactose or after induction. This design allowed comparison of protective versus therapeutic effects. Both concurrent and post-treatment with D-limonene substantially decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and the oxidative stress marker MDA, while enhancing antioxidant components (SOD and GPx) and promoting the synthesis of collagen types I and III. Additionally, it improved skin thickness and histomorphological scores, restoring normal skin architecture. D-limonene exerts potent anti-aging and skin-rejuvenating effects by modulating oxidation and inflammatory markers, suggesting its potential as a preventive and curative anti-aging agent.

[PMID: 41186651] Progesterone, traditionally recognized for maintaining the gestational environment, also plays a pivotal immunomodulatory role essential for successful pregnancy in bovine species. This review synthesizes current understanding of progesterone-mediated immune regulation during early bovine pregnancy, focusing on its molecular mechanisms. These include genomic pathways involving nuclear progesterone receptors, non-genomic signaling through membrane progesterone receptors and progesterone receptor membrane component 1, and immunoregulatory effects mediated by the progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF). Progesterone acts both locally at the maternal-fetal interface and systemically, shaping immune tolerance and protecting the developing conceptus. Locally, it promotes an anti-inflammatory microenvironment by expanding regulatory T cells, reducing the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, and suppressing dendritic cell activation. It downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, while upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-4 and interleukin-10. Additionally, progesterone inhibits the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway, thereby attenuating inflammatory responses. PIBF contributes by enhancing T helper 2 cytokine profiles and reducing cytotoxic activity. Emerging evidence also suggests that progesterone modulates immune function in peripheral organs, including the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, indicating systemic immunoregulation. However, species-specific differences in receptor expression, signaling cascades, and immune cell responsiveness remain poorly understood. Addressing these gaps is essential for optimizing reproductive management in cattle. In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of progesterone's immunological roles may lead to improved fertility outcomes and advance knowledge of maternal-fetal immune tolerance in ruminants.

[PMID: 41186354] Myeloma overexpressed gene (MYEOV) was initially identified as a gene amplified in several malignancies and was found to promote cell proliferation and metastasis. Our previous comparative RNA sequencing and epigenetic analyses revealed high MYEOV levels in differentiated corneal epithelial cells and showed that TET2 epigenetically regulated MYEOV expression. In the current study, we aimed to further characterize the expression and regulation of MYEOV in the human ocular surface. MYEOV expression was examined by immunostaining of the human corneas and by analysis of the publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data. Gene knockdown (KD) of MYEOV and the regulators of corneal epithelial differentiation, PAX6 and KLF4, in in vitro-expanded corneal epithelial cells was performed using siRNA transfection. Protein expression levels were examined by western blot. MYEOV KD cells were subjected to colony-forming and EdU cell proliferation assays and RNA sequencing analysis. Human cornea immunostaining revealed strong MYEOV expression in the KRT12-positive differentiated corneal epithelial cells, whereas the majority of KRT13-positive differentiated conjunctival epithelial cells were MYEOV negative. MYEOV expression was not detected in the other surface ectoderm-derived epithelia, such as skin and oral mucosa. Both PAX6 KD and KLF4 KD resulted in a reduction of MYEOV and KRT12 protein expression. MYEOV KD decreased cell proliferation. Our study revealed specific high MYEOV expression in KRT12-positive corneal epithelial cells among surface ectoderm-derived epithelia. Similar to KRT12, MYEOV expression is regulated by PAX6 and KLF4. Functionally, MYEOV regulates the proliferation of transient amplifying cells in the cornea.

[PMID: 41186245] Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a major contributor to mortality in septic patients, with its mechanisms being incompletely understood and effective therapies lacking. While the gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) has shown beneficial effects in systemic infections, its specific role and mechanisms in SAE remain undefined. We investigated the role of AKK in a murine model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Oral administration of AKK was confirmed via 16S rRNA sequencing. Mice underwent behavioral assessments to evaluate cognitive function. Hippocampal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured, and transcriptomic profiling was performed to identify key mediators. Functional analyses were conducted to delineate the role of the identified protein, Decorin (DCN), in neuronal survival, apoptosis, and autophagy. Simultaneously, we intervened in the expression of mouse DCN using AAV virus and further validated. Oral AKK pretreatment was successfully enriched in the gut and significantly ameliorated CLP-induced cognitive deficits. It concurrently reduced hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokine levels through a robust, DCN-independent anti-inflammatory pathway. Transcriptomics revealed that AKK treatment notably upregulated hippocampal DCN expression. Functional studies demonstrated that DCN contributed to AKK's neuroprotective effects by promoting autophagy and suppressing neuronal apoptosis, representing a distinct mechanism of action. Our findings reveal a dual mechanism through which AKK mitigates SAE: (1) suppression of hippocampal inflammation via a DCN-independent pathway, and (2) DCN-dependent modulation of neuronal apoptosis and autophagy. This study establishes AKK as a promising microbial intervention for SAE and identifies DCN as a context-specific mediator of its neuroprotective effects.

[PMID: 41186244] Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a critical role in hypertension by activating toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR4, which contributes to end-organ damage and vascular injury. Ang 1-7, a by-product of the RAAS system, is known to counteract the deleterious effects of Ang II; however, the potential protective effects of the peptides, Ang 1-7 and BNP in Ang II induced TLR4 activation remain unexplored. Therefore, our study primarily focused on investigating the effects of Ang 1-7 and BNP on Ang II-induced TLR4 activation in renal and primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We utilized renal epithelial cells (RECs), renal fibroblasts (RFbs), and VSMCs to assess end-organ damage and vascular dysfunction mediated by Ang II. Gene expression of TLR4 and its downstream markers was evaluated via qPCR. Additionally, the impact of Ang 1-7 and BNP on inflammatory, hypertrophic and fibrotic markers was assessed using qPCR and immunocytochemistry. Ang II stimulation led to the upregulation of TLR4-mediated pathways in RECs and VSMCs, with a significant increase in hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation observed in RECs and RFbs. Treatment with Ang 1-7 and BNP notably reduced TLR4-mediated injury markers and prevented the phenotypic switch. Furthermore, these peptides significantly inhibited Ang II-induced TLR4 pathways in primary VSMCs and RECs. Importantly, the Ang II-induced injury and phenotypic switch were driven by pro-inflammatory and fibrotic markers, which were reversed by peptide treatment. These findings suggest that Ang 1-7 and BNP offer a promising avenue for future research, peptide-based strategies for protecting vital organs.

[PMID: 41186005] Aeromonas hydrophila-induced bacterial sepsis is a major threat to aquaculture, characterised by excessive inflammation, ferroptosis (an iron-dependent lipid peroxidation-driven cell death) and oxidative damage, which collectively lead to high mortality. Taurine (TAU) and glutathione (GSH) have been demonstrated to have potential therapeutic efficacy against ferroptosis-associated pathologies through redox modulation. However, their combined effects and underlying mechanisms in alleviating A. hydrophila infection remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the protective roles of TAU, GSH and their combination in vitro using yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) macrophages and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) kidney (CIK) cells and in vivo using yellow catfish challenged with A. hydrophila. The results showed that TAU and GSH, either alone or in combination, alleviated oxidative stress by significantly reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and inhibited nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway activation. This led to downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β), accompanied by alleviated ferroptosis. In vivo, dietary supplementation with TAU (10 g/kg) or GSH (350 mg/kg) alone improved survival rates (51.7% and 38.3%, respectively), reduced tissue bacterial loads and protected intestinal and hepatic tissues by preserving mucosal barrier function. However, the TAU + GSH combination unexpectedly decreased survival (28.3%) due to excessive immunosuppression (overproduction of IL-10 and TGF-β) and impaired mucosal barrier, which exacerbated pathogen colonisation. Together, our findings demonstrate that TAU and GSH alleviate A. hydrophila-induced oxidative stress by reducing mitochondrial ROS overproduction and disrupting the ROS/NF-κB signalling pathway, thereby attenuating inflammatory cytokine storms and ferroptosis. These results provide novel insights into the pathological mechanisms of bacterial sepsis in fish and develop sustainable strategies to improve disease resistance in aquaculture.

[PMID: 41185995] Ang II (angiotensin II) causes hypertension and vascular inflammation both directly and indirectly via cytokines, including TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α). In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), Ang II and TNFα activate Nox1 (NADPH oxidase 1) to produce superoxide. TNFα receptors associate with Nox1 and LRRC8A (leucine-rich repeat containing 8A) anion channels to modulate inflammation and contractility in a RhoA-dependent manner. VSMC-specific LRRC8A knockout mesenteric arteries are protected from TNFα-induced injury, and vasodilation is preserved. We hypothesized that LRRC8A knockout would preserve vascular function and decrease blood pressure (BP) in Ang II-infused mice. Wild-type and knockout mice received Ang II infusions for 14 days. BP was measured by radiotelemetry, and aortic and mesenteric artery function was measured by wire myography. VSMCs were isolated from male wild-type and knockout mice. Systolic BP was not different, but knockout mice had more BP dipping during inactive periods at baseline, and dipping was preserved after Ang II. The function of knockout aortic and mesenteric vessels was less impaired by Ang II, as reflected by less augmented contraction to norepinephrine and serotonin and preserved relaxation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Western blotting revealed increased soluble guanylate cyclase alpha and reduced CPI-17 in hypertensive knockout aortae. Consistent with lower Rho kinase activity, phosphorylation of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) and cofilin was reduced in knockout VSMCs. Ang II caused less proliferation (lower PCNA [proliferating cell nuclear antigen]) and less induction of senescence in knockout vessels. LRRC8A anion channels support VSMC inflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction, which impairs BP dipping in hypertension.

[PMID: 41185743] Many meta-analyses and systematic reviews have explored the impact of omega-3 supplementation on clinical outcomes in individuals with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Thus, this study aimed to capture the effects of omega-3 supplementation on GI cancers and associated complications. This umbrella study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive advanced search was executed across Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science until 25 January 2025. Data were pooled by using random-effects models based on heterogeneity. The entire statistical analysis was performed via RStudio and R. The statistical analysis results are presented as the mean difference (MD), standard mean difference (SMD), and relative risk (RR) in conjunction with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Eight meta-analysis papers were included in our umbrella review. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation improved the serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (SMD: -0.34; 95% CI: -0.56, -0.11), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (SMD: -0.30; 95% CI: -0.49, -0.12; MD: -4.96; 95% CI: -6.62, -3.30), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: -5.46; 95% CI: -10.06, -0.87). Omega-3 supplementation improved the CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> ratio (SMD: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.71) and reduced the length of hospitalization (MD: -2.45 d; 95% CI: -3.11, -1.80). Omega-3 supplementation was associated with a 24% significant reduction in the risk of overall complications (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.86). Omega-3 supplementation may reduce the risk of overall complications and length of hospitalization in individuals suffering from GI cancers. Additionally, supplementation with omega-3 may alleviate the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, and acute-phase proteins such as CRP.

[PMID: 41185635] Adipose tissues have long been recognized for their diverse endocrine functions that serve to regulate tissue homeostasis. Although adipose depot-specific secretory profiles can differentially regulate fibroblast fate and fibrotic tissue remodeling, systematic investigation of how adipose depots of varying phenotypes influence fibroblast mechanobiology remains lacking. By integrating secretome profiling with functional and mechanobiological assays in a controlled adipose-fibroblast coculture platform, we mechanistically investigate how canonical brown (BAT), white (WAT), and beige adipose tissues (thoracic and abdominal perivascular adipose tissue; T-PVAT and A-PVAT, respectively) govern fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT) through depot-specific paracrine signaling. Thermogenic depots (BAT and T-PVAT) enhance fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and stiffness (1.9-fold increase in single cell modulus; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) alongside specific adipokines that regulate metabolism (ANGPTL3, FGF1) and inhibit calcification (Fetuin A). In contrast, lipid-storing depots (WAT and A-PVAT) promote fibroblast migration (79% scratch wound closure at 12 h; <i>p</i> < 0.01) and matrix degradation through upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (CCL2, IL-6) and fibrogenic mediators (PAI-1, TIMP-1). Mechanistically, BAT and T-PVAT secretomes induce pro-contractile and matrix-producing fibroblast phenotypes, while A-PVAT and WAT promote migratory and matrix-remodeling behaviors. Further, T-PVAT uniquely combines BAT-like genetic identity with elevated RAGE-DPP4 signaling, resulting in excessive fibroblast activation, stiffening, and collagen production that can be attenuated via pharmacological inhibition of DPP4. Our findings establish adipose depots as distinct modulators of fibroblast phenotype, wherein depot-specific mediators promote mechanobiological alterations that balance reparative and pathological remodeling processes related to fibrosis. Differential biological responses by fibroblasts exposed to diverse adipose phenotypes underscores the potential for adipose-driven stromal crosstalk to mitigate fibrotic remodeling alongside metabolic and cardiovascular disease comorbidities.

The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187304] Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) represents a complex interplay of pathophysiological processes that create a self-perpetuating cycle of heart and kidney dysfunction. While it is clearly understood how hemodynamic changes connect pathogenesis in the two organs, other processes are also in play. Some are the structural changes involving both the cellular and extracellular compartments that precede functional alterations. Fibrosis, which is initiated by an inflammatory response triggering myofibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix production, is a common denominator of heart and kidney pathology in CRS. This review focuses on fibroblast activities as a crucial factor in disease onset and progression in CRS. We explore how fibrosis in one organ can trigger or worsen dysfunction in the other organ, and we describe the key pathological signaling pathways of cardiorenal fibrosis, the extracellular matrix-derived biomarkers that can aid clinical management and drug development, and the therapeutic opportunities that can be beneficial in CRS by targeting fibroblast activities.

[PMID: 41187054] The etiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of many uterine diseases including endometritis, cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), and pyometra remain poorly understood in canids, hindering the advancement of effective preventative therapeutics to ultimately improve fertility. The development of an in vitro endometrial cell culture system that mimics in vivo architecture, cellular morphology, and physiological responses would facilitate a greater understanding of the mechanisms of complex canine uterine diseases and reduce the need for in vivo research. Three-dimensional organoid cell cultures may provide an innovative approach for studying uterine pathologies in the bitch. Unlike traditional two-dimensional monolayer cell culture systems, organoids can be grown long-term whilst maintaining the structure, phenotype, and function of their organ of origin. Here we report the generation and characterization of canine endometrial organoids via immunohistochemistry (IHC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and RT-qPCR and demonstrate their responsiveness to exogenous steroid hormones mimicking the estrous cycle. Furthermore, gene expression of key inflammatory markers was upregulated in endometrial organoids derived from bitches with CEH compared to organoids derived from healthy tissue. Findings highlight canine endometrial organoids as a valuable model to study both normal uterine physiology and disease-related processes in dogs. Organoids are cells that are grown three-dimensionally in the laboratory that retain similar functions to the organ from which the cells were collected. Organoids were used here to study the female dog reproductive tissue without the need for live animals, which saves time and money and improves animal welfare. We developed a three-dimensional model of the dog uterus that responds to reproductive hormones and maintains its normal structure. In addition, we used diseased canine tissue to replicate cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), a condition that affects pregnancy and can lead to the serious disease of pyometra in which the uterus is infected and filled with pus. In future studies, this validated model can be used to study how CEH develops and to test new treatments for the disease.

[PMID: 41186650] Patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are at increased risk for infections. Identifying clinical and immunological biomarkers predictive of infection is essential. We included 169 patients from the MYOTReCSZ cohort, all with ≥ 6 months of follow-up. Clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected, including: (1) low-density granulocytes and monocyte subsets, (2) serum cytokines, and (3) neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) quantification. The primary outcome was infection development. Most patients were female (72.78%), with a median age of 42. At least one infection occurred in 46.7% of patients; 55.6% were severe and 32.9% had recurrent infections. Independent predictors of infection included number of immunosuppressants (OR 1.7, P = 0.023), gastrointestinal activity score, cardiovascular damage-VAS, anti-Jo1 positivity (OR 10.0, P = 0.05), heliotrope rash, alopecia, and mycophenolate mofetil use (OR 11.9, P = 0.026). Severe infections were associated with number of immunosuppressants, low albumin, constitutional activity score, gastrointestinal damage-VAS, and TLR4⁺ intermediate monocytes (OR 1.0, P = 0.038). Recurrent infections correlated with lower TLR2⁺ classical monocytes (OR 0.4, P = 0.045), cumulative prednisone dose, global damage-VAS (OR 2.0, P = 0.0004), and anti-PM/Scl75 positivity (OR 3.8, P = 0.006). In conclusion, IIM patients with higher baseline activity and damage scores, specific autoantibodies, and altered innate immune cell phenotypes are more likely to develop infections. These parameters may serve as early biomarkers to stratify infection risk in clinical practice.

[PMID: 41185926] Heat shock protein 22 (HSP22) can reduce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) induced vascular endothelial injury by inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress. Therefore, we explored whether HSP22 alleviated diabetes cardiomyopathy (DCM) in mice. A T2DM mouse model was constructed and myocardial tissues were used to perform transcriptome sequencing. HSP22 transgenic and HSP22 knockout mice were established to confirm its role in DCM. Transthoracic echocardiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, TUNEL staining and apoptosis-related proteins were detected to evaluate myocardial injury. Dihydroethidium staining, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase levels were detected to evaluate myocardial oxidative stress. We performed RT-PCR to detect inflammatory factors and evaluate the myocardial inflammatory response. Immunohistochemical staining, RT-PCR and western blot were used to define the expression of HSP22 in mouse myocardial tissues. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed the expression of HSP22 in myocardium of T2DM mice significantly decreases. GO analysis found that oxidative stress and inflammatory response were closely related to DCM in mice. Furthermore, HSP22 overexpression can alleviate DCM in mice and HSP22 knockout aggravated DCM. HSP22 reduced oxidative stress and inflammation to alleviate DCM in mice.

[PMID: 41185834] Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a serious condition with varied manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that involves the central and peripheral nervous systems. While seizures and psychiatric components are common findings, brain atrophy is not frequently reported, especially in young individuals. We present a case of a 22-year-old Saudi female who presented with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and a significant history of undiagnosed psychiatric suffering. Neuroimaging of the brain demonstrated cortical atrophy and extensive subcortical hyperintensities. Autoimmune serology revealed SLE with the positivity of anti-dsDNA and anticardiolipin antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with NPSLE and treated with corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, and rituximab. A one-year follow-up MRI showed radiological stability with no new lesions or progression of atrophy. Clinically, she achieved complete seizure remission and improved neurocognitive function. We performed a structured literature review following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Databases were searched, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer, and Web of Science, for publications between 2013 and 2025. A total of 1,770 results were screened, and 20 studies were included in the review. The literature review and the case that is discussed support the link between neuroinflammation, injury mediated by autoantibodies, and structural brain changes in NPSLE. Seizures are regularly observed; cortical atrophy is atypical but could represent significant, long-term damage, especially among adults. Immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab can help stabilize both radiological findings and clinically significant manifestations of the disease.  This report highlights the necessity of early recognition of neuropsychiatric symptoms in young individuals with an undiagnosed SLE. If an MRI shows central nervous system (CNS) atrophy, then aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is warranted despite the rare nature of findings during clinical presentation. Longitudinal imaging combined with multidisciplinary care may be particularly appropriate, as coordination among the neurologist, rheumatologist, and primary care physician is essential to achieving favorable outcomes in NPSLE.

[PMID: 41185362] This correspondence comments on the recent study by Lee et al. (2025) published in Food Research International, which investigated Naturaldream Brown Rice (NBR) cultivated with deep-sea mineral fertiliser for its potential in colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. NBR demonstrated enriched mineral and γ-oryzanol content, enhanced antioxidant capacity, and significant modulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic markers in in vitro HT-29 colon cancer cells and in vivo AOM/DSS mouse models. The study further revealed potent anti-inflammatory effects and gut microbiota reprogramming towards a eubiotic profile. However, limitations remain regarding the translation of these findings, as rodent AOM/DSS models do not fully recapitulate the complexity of human CRC pathogenesis. Future studies should critically assess human applicability before broad claims are made. These findings highlight NBR as a promising functional food developed through sustainable agriculture, bridging ecological crop production with targeted disease prevention. Moreover, the integration of deep-sea mineral fertiliser should be evaluated not only for nutrient enrichment but also for long-term soil health, carbon footprint reduction, and life-cycle sustainability metrics.

[PMID: 41184994] This study aimed to investigate longitudinal change of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy-associated interstitial lung disease (IIM-ILD) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). This prospective cohort study was undertaken involving 514 IIM-ILD patients (367 females; median age 54 years) from 2016 to 2022. Deep learning algorithms were employed to quantify interstitial lesions on HRCT, while clinical parameters including pulmonary function tests, serum biomarkers, and arterial blood gas analysis were also considered. The study identified anti-MDA5 antibody positivity (OR: 10.46, 95% CI: 3.40-32.22), reduced FVC (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-0.98), and extensive ground-glass opacity (GGO) (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.13)/ reticulation (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.41) involvement as independent risk factors for rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) within IIM. During the rapid progressive period of RP-ILD, anti-MDA5-positive dermatomyositis (MDA5 + DM) showed greater progression in fibrotic, inflammatory, and emphysema lesions compared to anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS). In the slow progressive period, MDA5 + DM tended towards chronic fibrosis, while ASS exhibited overall improvement. The extent of lesion increase in non-RP-ILD patients is significantly smaller than in those who have experienced RP. Reticular and consolidation changes were strongly correlated with variations in VC%, FVC%, and FEV<sub>1</sub>%, and moderately associated with changes in TLC and DL<sub>CO</sub>. The prognostic impact of GGO proportion on adverse outcomes intensified with longer follow-up durations, with each 1-unit increase in whole-lung GGO proportion linked to a 0.56% higher risk of adverse outcomes (HR: 1.0056, 95% CI: 1.001-1.010). IIM-ILD cases with prior rapid progression will develop chronic fibrotic trajectories with persistent inflammation compared to non-progressive cases. ASS is characterized by sustained inflammatory activity in imaging manifestations, whereas MDA5 + DM shows post-acute fibrotic remodeling following initial injury. Longitudinal GGO emerges as a critical prognostic indicator, demonstrating time-dependent cumulative risk effects.",10
Combination nicotine replacement therapies with varenicline or bupropion are more effective after 12 weeks of reatment compared to varenicline monotherapy.,Combination nicotine replacement therapy AND Varenicline AND Bupropion AND Smoking cessation,"41025676,40391127,40385053,40004917,39889280,39876021,39868569,39659160,39556472,39231467","[PMID: 41025676] Tobacco use poses a large public health problem, particularly among those with mental illness, but behavioral health providers often do not prioritize management of this disorder. This is a new algorithm from the Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project at the Harvard South Shore Program for the treatment of tobacco use disorder, taking into account pertinent findings in articles, meta-analyses, reviews, and other published algorithms. Once patients are prepared to try medications, we first consider exceptions to the main algorithm when there is comorbid major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, other serious mental illnesses, posttraumatic stress disorders, alcohol use disorder, cardiovascular morbidity, seizure disorders, or weight gain that could affect the choice of pharmacological agents. In patients with depression, bupropion could be considered as initial treatment, while bupropion should usually be avoided in patients with bipolar disorder and is relatively contraindicated in those with a seizure disorder. In the main algorithm, for patients who smoke cigarettes, varenicline has been convincingly established as the most effective treatment, with combined nicotine replacement therapy as a potential second-choice consideration. In the event of unsatisfactory response to varenicline after an adequate trial (described in detail), augmentation with bupropion may be considered; the role of combination therapy (eg, varenicline + NRT) is less well established and is discussed in the context of limited evidence. For users of smokeless tobacco, the evidence is also in favor of using varenicline first-line. Management of the side effects of these medications is discussed. The algorithm concludes with a discussion of other options with less support but with potential future promise.

[PMID: 40391127] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent respiratory disorders, with smoking being a major risk factor. Smoking cessation is therefore crucial in the management of COPD. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety profiles of common cessation therapies, including nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline. Using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from Q1 2004 to Q2 2024, we analyzed adverse events (AEs) associated with bupropion, nicotine, and varenicline in COPD patients. Disproportionality analysis, case-by-case evaluation, and co-medication analysis were performed to identify positive safety signals. Eighty-eight positive safety signals were identified, primarily involving psychiatric, nervous system, and gastrointestinal disorders. Notable AEs included depression, nausea, anxiety, abnormal dreams, and insomnia. Critically, eight PTs indicated serious AEs associated with psychiatric disorders that were not present in the labeling but required Important Medical Event (IME) surveillance. Experiencing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (eg, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts) was the major reason for limiting the use of these drugs, especially varenicline, for which the FDA issued a black box warning in 2009. Nicotine combined with varenicline showed higher risks for skin reactions and gastrointestinal issues. Most AEs occurred within the first 30 days of therapy, with some persisting beyond a year. This study highlights significant psychiatric, neurological, and gastrointestinal AEs associated with smoking cessation therapies in patients with COPD. Clinicians are advised to be particularly cautious of these risks, especially when using combination therapies or treating patients with a predisposition to psychiatric disorders.

[PMID: 40385053] Nicotine addiction is a complex phenomenon entwined with intricate mechanisms within the nicotine receptor pathway. This review offers an insightful exploration of this multifaceted landscape, delving into the interplay between nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and their pivotal role in neurotransmission. The structural and functional aspects of nAChRs, their distribution within the peripheral and central nervous systems, and their involvement in modulating diverse signalling cascades are reviewed. The clinical implications of nicotine addiction and the challenges in smoking cessation are also explored. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) drugs, designed to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and aid in smoking cessation, are critically evaluated. This article synthesizes current research findings on the efficacy, safety, and limitations of various NRT modalities. Furthermore, emerging pharmacotherapeutic strategies and novel molecules aimed at optimizing NRT outcomes are discussed. The potential of leveraging a deeper understanding of the nicotine receptor pathway to develop more targeted and efficacious NRT interventions is emphasized. The exploration of adjunct therapies and combination approaches to enhance the success rates of smoking cessation is also addressed. Through a synthesis of preclinical and clinical evidence, this article aims to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers working towards advancing the field of nicotine addiction treatment. As the global effort to combat tobacco-related health challenges intensifies, a nuanced understanding of the nicotine receptor pathway and its therapeutic implications becomes increasingly imperative.

[PMID: 40004917] Smoking is one of the strongest modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease. It is the cause of approximately 10-30% of deaths due to cardiovascular disease around the world. There is a 50% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction by one year for people who successfully quit smoking. Considering the risk associated with smoking and the benefits of smoking cessation, it is important to identify and implement effective smoking cessation strategies. There are pharmacological as well as non-pharmacological interventions to assist in smoking cessation. Pharmacological therapies including nicotine replacement therapy; bupropion and varenicline have generally been studied more in patients with cardiovascular disease than the non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological strategies for smoking cessation include behavioural interventions such as counselling sessions and cognitive behavioural therapy. Studies and randomised controlled trials have demonstrated the safety of most of the pharmacological interventions. Nonetheless, the success rates are variable for the different pharmacological options. Data suggest that greater success can be achieved in smoking cessation with a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. However, more studies are needed to explore the best therapeutic options to improve the success of smoking cessation.

[PMID: 39889280] Hispanic adults receive less advice to quit smoking and use fewer evidence-based smoking cessation treatments compared to their non-Hispanic counterparts. Digital smoking cessation interventions, such as those delivered via smartphone apps, provide a feasible and within-reach treatment option for Hispanic adults who smoke and want to quit smoking. While the combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions are considered best practices for smoking cessation, its efficacy among Hispanic adults, especially alongside smartphone app-based interventions, is uncertain. This secondary analysis used data from a randomized controlled trial that compared the efficacy of 2 smoking cessation apps, iCanQuit (based on acceptance and commitment therapy) and QuitGuide (following US clinical practice guidelines), to explore the association between pharmacotherapy use and smoking cessation outcomes among the subsample of 173 Hispanic participants who reported on pharmacotherapy use. Given the randomized design, we first tested the potential interaction of pharmacotherapy use and intervention arm on 12-month cigarette smoking abstinence. We then examined whether the use of any pharmacotherapy (ie, nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], varenicline, or bupropion) and NRT alone augmented each app-based intervention efficacy. Participants reported using pharmacotherapy on their own during the 3-month follow-up and cigarette smoking abstinence at the 12-month follow-up via web-based surveys. These data were used (1) to test the interaction effect of using pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation and intervention arm (iCanQuit vs QuitGuide) on smoking cessation at 12 months and (2) to test whether the use of pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation augmented the efficacy of each intervention arm to help participants successfully quit smoking. The subsample of Hispanic participants was recruited from 30 US states. They were on average 34.5 (SD 9.3) years of age, 50.9% (88/173) were female, and 56.1% (97/173) reported smoking at least 10 cigarettes daily. Approximately 22% (38/173) of participants reported using pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation at the 3-month follow-up, including NRT, varenicline, or bupropion, with no difference between intervention arms. There was an interaction between pharmacotherapy use and intervention arm that marginally influenced 12-month quit rates at 12 months (P for interaction=.053). In the iCanQuit arm, 12-month missing-as-smoking quit rates were 43.8% (7/16) for pharmacotherapy users versus 28.8% (19/16) for nonusers (odds ratio 2.21, 95% CI 0.66-7.48; P=.20). In the QuitGuide arm, quit rates were 9.1% (2/22) for pharmacotherapy users versus 21.7% (15/69) for nonusers (odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.07-1.72; P=.20). Results were similar for the use of NRT only. Combining pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation with a smartphone app-based behavioral intervention that teaches acceptance of cravings to smoke (iCanQuit) shows promise in improving quit rates among Hispanic adults. However, this combined approach was not effective with the US clinical guideline-based app (QuitGuide). ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02724462; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02724462.

[PMID: 39876021] Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of death and disease, including those related to the cardiovascular system. Cytisine is a plant-based medication, which works in a similar mechanism to varenicline. It is safe, efficacious, and cost-effective for smoking cessation. While there are effective therapies such as nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline, and cytisine for smoking cessation, relapse remains common. It is unclear how best to support these individuals. This study aims to assess the feasibility of randomizing patients who relapse to combination NRT or cytisine after admission to a cardiac hospital. Randomized, two-group parallel feasibility trial. This trial will recruit relapsed smokers from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive cytisine or combination NRT, alongside counseling and follow-up support. Feasibility outcomes include recruitment rates and treatment completion. Secondary outcomes include smoking cessation rates and adverse events. A total of 60 participants will be recruited using stratified randomization by sex to ensure gender balance. Data will be analyzed descriptively, focusing on feasibility and efficacy measures to inform future trials. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting patients who were recently admitted to the hospital and have relapsed to smoking within 180 days post-discharge. This will inform future studies aimed at recruiting patients who have relapsed to understand how best to support them to quit smoking. This study will also compare the acceptability, efficacy, and safety of cytisine compared to combination NRT, as demonstrated in previous studies in other populations. Notably, cytisine's shorter regimen and natural composition broaden its appeal, potentially supporting a wider spectrum of people who smoke. The study's robust design, infrastructure, and expertise enhance its feasibility. Future research avenues, especially among cardiac patients and relapsed individuals, promise further insights, potentially transforming cessation strategies worldwide. Registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (CT04286295) on 14 March 2022. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04286295?locStr=Canada&country=Canada&intr=Cytisine&rank=3 .

[PMID: 39868569] People from lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to smoke and less likely to succeed in achieving abstinence, making tobacco smoking a leading driver of health inequalities. Contextual factors affecting subpopulations may moderate the efficacy of individual-level smoking cessation interventions. It is not known whether any intervention performs differently across socioeconomically-diverse populations and contexts. To assess whether the effects of individual-level smoking cessation interventions on combustible tobacco cigarette use differ by socioeconomic groups, and their potential impact on health equalities. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to 1 May 2023 for Cochrane reviews investigating individual-level smoking cessation interventions. We selected studies included in these reviews that met our criteria. We contacted study authors to identify further eligible studies. We included parallel, cluster or factorial randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating any individual-level smoking cessation intervention which encouraged complete cessation of combustible tobacco cigarette use compared to no intervention, placebo, or another intervention in adults. Studies must have assessed or reported smoking quit rates, split by any measure of socioeconomic status (SES) at longest follow-up (≥ six months), and been published in 2000 or later. We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. We assessed the availability of smoking abstinence data by SES in lieu of selective reporting. The primary outcome was smoking cessation quit rates, split by lower and higher SES, at the longest follow-up (≥ six months). Where possible, we calculated ratios of odds ratios (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study, comparing lower to higher SES. We pooled RORs by intervention type in random-effects meta-analyses, using the generic inverse-variance method. We subgrouped by type of SES indicator and economic classification of the study country. We summarised all evidence in effect direction plots and categorised the intervention impact on health equality as: positive (evidence that the relative effect of the intervention on quit rates was greater in lower rather than higher SES groups), possibly positive, neutral, possibly neutral, possibly negative, negative, no reported statistically significant difference, or unclear. We evaluated certainty using GRADE. We included 77 studies (73 from high-income countries), representing 127,791 participants. We deemed 12 studies at low overall risk of bias, 13 at unclear risk, and the remaining 52 at high risk. Included studies investigated a range of pharmacological interventions, behavioural support, or combinations of these. Pharmacological interventions We found very low-certainty evidence for all the main pharmacological interventions compared to control. Evidence on cytisine (ROR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.74; 1 study, 2472 participants) and nicotine electronic cigarettes (ROR 4.57, 95% CI 0.88 to 23.72; 1 study, 989 participants) compared to control indicated a greater relative effect of these interventions on quit rates in lower compared to higher SES groups, suggesting a possibly positive impact on health equality. CIs for both estimates included the possibility of no clinically important difference and of favouring higher SES groups. There was a lower relative effect of bupropion versus placebo on quit rates in lower compared to higher SES groups, indicating a possibly negative impact on health equality (ROR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.00; from 1 of 2 studies, 354 participants; 1 study reported no difference); however, the CI included the possibility of no clinically important difference. We could not determine the intervention impact of combination or single-form nicotine replacement therapy on relative quit rates by SES. No studies on varenicline versus control were included. Behavioural interventions We found low-certainty evidence of lower quit rates in lower compared to higher SES groups for print-based self-help (ROR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; 3 studies, 4440 participants) and text-messaging (ROR 0.76, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.23; from 3 of 4 studies, 5339 participants; 1 study reported no difference) versus control, indicating a possibly negative impact on health equality. CIs for both estimates included the possibility of no clinically important difference and of favouring lower SES groups. There was very low-certainty evidence of quit rates favouring higher SES groups for financial incentives compared to balanced intervention components. However, the CI included the possibility of no clinically important difference and of favouring lower SES groups (ROR 0.91, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.85; from 5 of 6 studies, 3018 participants; 1 study reported no difference). This indicates a possibly negative impact on health equality. There was very low-certainty evidence of no difference in quit rates by SES for face-to-face counselling compared to less intensive counselling, balanced components, or usual care. However, the CI included the possibility of favouring lower and higher SES groups (ROR 1.26, 95% CI 0.18 to 8.93; from 1 of 6 studies, 294 participants; 5 studies reported no difference), indicating a possibly neutral impact. We found very low-certainty evidence of a greater relative effect of telephone counselling (ROR 4.31, 95% CI 1.28 to 14.51; from 1 of 7 studies, 903 participants; 5 studies reported no difference, 1 unclear) and internet interventions (ROR 1.49, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.25; from 1 of 5 studies, 4613 participants; 4 studies reported no difference) versus control on quit rates in lower versus higher SES groups, suggesting a possibly positive impact on health equality. The CI for the internet intervention estimate included the possibility of no difference. Although the CI for the telephone counselling estimate only favoured lower SES groups, most studies narratively reported no clear evidence of interaction effects. Currently, there is no clear evidence to support the use of differential individual-level smoking cessation interventions for people from lower or higher SES groups, or that any one intervention would have an effect on health inequalities. This conclusion may change as further data become available. Many studies did not report sufficient data to be included in a meta-analysis, despite having tested the association of interest. Further RCTs should collect, analyse, and report quit rates by measures of SES, to inform intervention development and ensure recommended interventions do not exacerbate but help reduce health inequalities caused by smoking.

[PMID: 39659160] The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the leading smoking cessation medications among individuals with current versus past major depressive disorder (MDD). This was a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind trial over 12 weeks with varenicline or bupropion, followed by a 12-week assessment, in participants ages 18-75 with past (N=2,174) or current (N=451) MDD or without psychiatric disorders (N=4,028). Interventions included 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy with placebo, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; nicotine patch), bupropion, or varenicline, and brief counseling. The primary safety outcome was occurrence of one or more moderate to severe neuropsychiatric adverse events. Efficacy was assessed as biochemically verified continuous abstinence during weeks 9-12. Among all 6,653 participants, the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events did not differ by medication within the past-MDD, current-MDD, or nonpsychiatric cohorts. The MDD cohorts had higher risk difference (p<0.001) for neuropsychiatric adverse events compared with the nonpsychiatric cohort (past-MDD cohort, risk difference=-0.03, 95% CI=-0.05, -0.02; current-MDD cohort, risk difference=-0.02, 95% CI=-0.05, 0.00). Within the past-MDD cohort, the odds ratios compared with placebo were 3.0 (95% CI=2.0, 4.5) for varenicline, 2.1 (95% CI=1.6, 2.7) for bupropion, and 2.1 (95% CI=1.4, 3.2) for NRT. Within the current-MDD cohort, varenicline differed from placebo (odds ratio=2.67, 95% CI=1.2, 6.15) and NRT (odds ratio=2.93, 95% CI=1.2, 7.2). All medications were generally safe in both MDD cohorts. NRT and bupropion were not more effective than placebo for those with current MDD. Varenicline plus counseling may be the best treatment for individuals with past or current MDD, given its greater efficacy, similar risk of adverse events, and, for those with current depression, reductions in anxiety and depression while trying to quit smoking.

[PMID: 39556472] The number one cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States is tobacco use. According to data from the National Health Interview Survey, 18.7% of US adults (46 million people) currently use a tobacco product. Smoking causes lung, laryngeal, hepatocellular, and colorectal cancers and possibly breast cancer. Nicotine is the highly addictive component of tobacco that releases dopamine when it binds to alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. This produces reward sensations that become associated with specific behaviors and relieves stress and negative emotions. Public policy changes, behavioral interventions, and pharmacologic approaches have been shown to reduce tobacco use. Combining behavior therapy with pharmacotherapy increases cessation rates. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved five nicotine replacement therapies and two no-nicotine oral medications to assist with smoking cessation. Medications are categorized as controllers or relievers based on their pharmacokinetics. Nicotine replacement therapy delivers lower amounts of nicotine and needs to be titrated to alleviate patient cravings. Varenicline is a selective partial agonist at the alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and is recommended over bupropion for smoking cessation.

[PMID: 39231467] To summarise systematic reviews on tobacco addiction published by the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (CTAG) from 2021 to 2023. We identified all new and updated Cochrane Reviews published by CTAG between 2021 and 2023. We present key results from these reviews and discuss promising avenues for future research. CTAG published five new reviews and one overview of reviews, and updated eight reviews. Review evidence showed that all main pharmacotherapies (varenicline, cytisine, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], especially when patches are combined with fast acting forms like gum) are effective for smoking cessation, as are nicotine e-cigarettes. Evidence suggested similar magnitude of effects of varenicline, cytisine, and nicotine e-cigarettes; these emerged as the most effective treatments. Evidence also supported behavioural counselling and financial incentives for smoking cessation. Secondary analyses of the Cochrane review of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation showed over half of participants assigned to e-cigarette conditions were still using them at six months or longer, that biomarkers of potential harm significantly reduced in people switching from smoking to vaping or to dual use, and that there was insufficient evidence to draw associations between e-liquid flavours and smoking cessation. Findings on mindfulness-based interventions, interventions delivered by dental and primary care professionals, interventions to prevent weight gain after smoking cessation, and interventions for waterpipe cessation were less certain. Reviews of observational evidence showed that smoking cessation reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in people living with cardiovascular disease, and improved mental health. Nicotine replacement therapy (especially patches combined with fast acting forms), varenicline, cytisine, bupropion, nicotine e-cigarettes, behavioural counselling, and financial incentives are all effective ways to help people quit smoking. Quitting smoking improves mental health and reduces cardiovascular events and mortality in people living with cardiovascular disease.",10

Preclinical studies have predominantly used male animals, limiting findings' relevance to both sexes. This project aimed to explore sex differences in cirrhosis and portal hypertension (PH) in rats, and to find similarities in human samples for translational relevance. Advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) was induced in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats using thioacetamide (TAA, 250 mg/kg; 12 weeks) or bile duct ligation (BDL; 28 days). Healthy rats served as controls (n = 11-18/group). We assessed in vivo hepatic and systemic hemodynamic parameters, hepatic microvascular function, and hepatic transcriptomic analyses, including sex-specific differences in cellular composition using gene deconvolution (n = 5/group). Two human sample cohorts were compared to preclinical data for translational insights. Both animal models showed PH. TAA males had similar portal pressure (PP) to females (14.2 vs 14.1 mmHg), but BDL males had significantly higher PP than females (14.5 vs 12.5 mmHg; p = 0.003). No differences were observed in hepatic microvascular function. In the BDL model, females had more fenestrae and porosity, and less fibrosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TAA males had dysregulated metabolic pathways, while females had deregulated genes in hormone signaling. In the BDL model, males showed higher deregulation in platelet activation, protein degradation, vesicular transport, and disease-related pathways. Gene deconvolution showed males had a more specialized endothelial phenotype basally, with more changes in endothelial and macrophage phenotypes after injury. In MASLD patients, men had dysregulated metabolic pathways, while women showed deregulation in fibrosis, extracellular matrix, and endocrine regulation. In HBV patients, men had more dysregulation in fibrosis, inflammation, and immune response. Female MASLD patients had more activated hepatic stellate cells, and greater loss of endothelial phenotype compared to men. This study highlights sex-dependent molecular differences in the pathophysiology of cirrhosis in two preclinical models. Further research in preclinical and human liver disease is essential to develop safe and effective treatments for ACLD in both sexes.

[PMID: 38233918] Compared with corn, wheat contains higher crude protein, amino acids concentration. However, wheat contains a mass of anti-nutritional factors, resulting in increased of the digesta viscosity and impaired the intestinal function in ruminant. This study aimed to investigate the effects of substitution of different amounts of wheat for corn on hepatic metabolism in the Tibetan lamb. Ninety Tibetan lambs (Body weight = 12.37 ± 0.92 kg) were randomly assigned to three groups: 0% wheat diet (Control), 10% wheat diet (Low group), and 15% wheat diet (High group). The feeding trial lasted for 130 d, including a 10 d adaption period. Hepatic gene expression profiling was performed via RNA sequencing after the conclusion of the feeding trials. Results showed that greater level of glutathione peroxidase levels in L group compared with those of the C and H groups (P < 0.05). The immune indexes, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and IgM were also elevated in L group compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). Compared with H group, the hepatocytes were arranged radially, and hepatic plates anastomosed with each other to form a labyrinth-like structure in L group. Transcriptomic analysis showed 872 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between H and L group, of which 755 were down-regulated and 117 were up-regulated. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, 32 pathways were significantly enriched (Q-value < 0.05), such as the cAMP signaling pathway, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, leukocyte transendothelial migration, platelet activation and adipocytokine signaling pathway. Additionally, the expression of comment DEGs were verified via quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. In summary, our findings suggest that wheat can be supplemented up to 10% in Tibetan sheep, contributing to improve the hepatic oxidative stress, immune response and lipid metabolism through regulating the expression of related genes.

[PMID: 37904396] Gastric carcinoma is a common malignant tumor originating from gastric mucosal epithelium. However, role of DS-cell cycle-dependent protein 1 (DSCC1) and GINS1 in gastric carcinoma remains unclear. The gastric carcinoma datasets GSE79973 and GSE118916 were downloaded from gene expression omnibus. Multiple datasets were merged and batched. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed. Functional enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis and immune infiltration analysis were performed. Construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction Network. Survival analysis and comparative toxicogenomics database were performed. A heat map of gene expression was drawn. Target Scan screen miRNAs regulating DEGs. Two thousand forty-four DEGs were identified. According to gene ontology analysis, in biological process, they were mainly enriched in cell migration, transforming growth factor β receptor signaling pathway, angiogenesis, and steroid metabolism process. In cellular component, they were mainly enriched in extracellular vesicles, basement membrane, endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and extracellular space. In molecular function, they focused on extracellular matrix structural components, protein binding, platelet-derived growth factor binding, and catalytic activity. In Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes, they were mainly enriched in protein digestion and absorption, metabolic pathways, fatty acid degradation, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, ether lipid metabolism. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in transforming growth factor β receptor signaling pathway, steroid metabolism process, basement membrane, endoplasmic reticulum lumen, structural components of extracellular matrix, platelet-derived growth factor binding, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, ether lipid metabolism. The results of immune infiltration analysis showed that expression of T cell CD4 memory resting was lower in the samples of gastric cancer. The core genes (TRIP13, CHEK1, DSCC1, GINS1) are protective factors, their expression shows a downward trend with increase of risk score. Comparative toxicogenomics database analysis showed that TRIP13, CHEK1, DSCC1, GINS1 were related to gastric tumors, gastric diseases, tumors, inflammation, and necrosis. DSCC1 and GINS1 are highly expressed in gastric cancer. Higher expression levels of DSCC1 and GINS1, worse the prognosis.

[PMID: 37498421] Early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE) is a complex pregnancy complication that poses significant risks to the health of both mothers and fetuses, and research on its pathogenesis and pathophysiology remains insuffcient. This study aims to explore the role of candidate genes and their potential interaction mechanisms in EOPE through bioinformatics analysis techniques. Two gene expression datasets, GSE44711 and GSE74341, were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between EOPE and gestational age-matched preterm control samples. Functional enrichment analysis was performed utilizing the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), gene ontology (GO), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database, and hub DEGs were identified through Cytoscape software and comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD) analysis. Furthermore, a diagnostic logistic model was established using these hub genes, which were confirmed through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Finally, immune cell infiltration was analyzed using CIBERSORT. In total, 807 DEGs were identified in the GSE44711 dataset (451 upregulated genes and 356 downregulated genes), and 787 DEGs were identified in the GSE74341 dataset (446 upregulated genes and 341 downregulated genes). These DEGs were significantly enriched in various molecular functions such as extracellular matrix structural constituent, receptor-ligand activity binding, cytokine activity, and platelet-derived growth factor. KEGG and GSEA annotation revealed significant enrichment in pathways related to ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-AKT signaling, and focal adhesion. Ten hub genes were identified through the CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape. Among these hub genes, three key DEGs (COL1A1, SPP1, and THY1) were selected using CTD analysis and various topological methods in Cytoscape. The diagnostic logistic model based on these three genes exhibited high efficiency in predicting EOPE (AUC = 0.922). RT-PCR analysis confirmed the downregulation of these genes in EOPE, and immune cell infiltration analysis suggested the significant role of M1 and M2 macrophages in EOPE. In conclusion, this study highlights the association of three key genes (COL1A1, SPP1, and THY1) with EOPE and their contribution to high diagnostic efficiency in the logistic model. Additionally, it provides new insights for future research on EOPE and emphasizes the diagnostic value of these identified genes. More research is needed to explore their functional and diagnostic significance in EOPE.

[PMID: 33085906] C1q/TNF-related protein 1 (CTRP1) is an endocrine factor with metabolic, cardiovascular, and renal functions. We previously showed that aged <i>Ctrp1-</i>knockout (KO) mice fed a control low-fat diet develop renal hypertrophy and dysfunction. Since aging and obesity adversely affect various organ systems, we hypothesized that aging, in combination with obesity induced by chronic high-fat feeding, would further exacerbate renal dysfunction in CTRP1-deficient animals. To test this, we fed wild-type and <i>Ctrp1-</i>KO mice a high-fat diet for 8 mo or longer. Contrary to our expectation, no differences were observed in blood pressure, heart function, or vascular stiffness between genotypes. Loss of CTRP1, however, resulted in an approximately twofold renal enlargement (relative to body weight), ∼60% increase in urinary total protein content, and elevated pH, and changes in renal gene expression affecting metabolism, signaling, transcription, cell adhesion, solute and metabolite transport, and inflammation. Assessment of glomerular integrity, the extent of podocyte foot process effacement, as well as renal response to water restriction and salt loading did not reveal significant differences between genotypes. Interestingly, blood platelet, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts were significantly elevated, whereas mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin were reduced in <i>Ctrp1</i>-KO mice. Cytokine profiling revealed increased circulating levels of CCL17 and TIMP-1 in KO mice. Compared with our previous study, current data suggest that chronic high-fat feeding affects renal phenotypes differently than similarly aged mice fed a control low-fat diet, highlighting a diet-dependent contribution of CTRP1 deficiency to age-related changes in renal structure and function.

[PMID: 32914379] Platelet derived growth receptor alpha (PDGFRA) promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in thyroid follicular cells and is linked to lymphatic metastases in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). We probed the regulatory network of genes linked to PDGFRA and EMT, comparing matched patient primary tumor and metastatic specimens, as well as engineered cell lines and ex vivo primary cultures with and without PDGFRA. Freshly isolated thyroid tumors with or without metastases, with matching neighboring benign or normal tissue, was isolated for comparative transcriptional analysis using a TaqMan Low Density array (TLDA) assay with genes representing important markers of EMT, cellular adhesion, apoptosis, differentiation, senescence, and signal transduction pathways in thyroid cancer. Transfected primary cultures and immortalized cell lines were also analyzed with respect to PDGFRA expression and cell phenotype. We reveal the consistent upregulation of serine protease DPP4 and structural protein SPP1 with the progression of PTC to metastatic disease, as well as with PDGFRA expression. Conversely, epithelial integrity gene TFF3 and transcription factor SOX10 were strongly down-regulated. This gene network also includes important mediators of EMT including DSG1, MMP3, MMP9, and BECN. We observed similar genomic changes in ex vivo normal thyroid cells transfected with PDGFRA that also exhibited a partially dedifferentiated phenotype. In particular, we observed lamellopodia with induction of PDGFRA and illustrate that DPP4 and SPP1 were upregulated in this process, with decreased TFF3 and SOX10 as seen in tissue specimens. PDGFRA did decrease nuclear protein levels of differentiation factor TTF1, but not the transcription of TTF1 and PAX8. We demonstrate that PDGFRA activates EMT pathways and decreases expression of genes favoring epithelial integrity, pushing follicular cells toward a dedifferentiated phenotype. SPP1 and DPP4, previously linked with adverse outcomes in thyroid cancer, appear to be regulated by PDGFRA. PDGFRA expression promotes metastatic disease through multiple EMT levers that favor formation of an invasive phenotype and increased metalloproteinase expression.

[PMID: 32586411] The choroid plexus (CP) is a highly vascularized structure located in the ventricles that forms the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) and separates the blood from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition to its role as a physical barrier, the CP functions in CSF secretion, transport of nutrients into the central nervous system (CNS) and a gated point of entry of circulating immune cells into the CNS. Aging and neurodegeneration have been reported to affect CP morphology and function and increase protein leakage from blood to the CSF. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with both upper and lower motor neuron loss, as well as altered proteomic and metabolomic signatures in the CSF. The role of the BCSFB and the CP in ALS is unknown. Here we describe a transcriptomic and ultrastructural analysis of BCSFB and CP alterations in human postmortem tissues from ALS and non-neurologic disease controls. ALS-CP exhibited widespread disruptions in tight junctional components of the CP epithelial layer and vascular integrity. In addition, we detected loss of pericytes around ALS blood vessels, accompanied by activation of platelet aggregation markers vWF and Fibrinogen, reminiscent of vascular injury. To investigate the immune component of ALS-CP, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of cytokines and chemokine panels in CP lysates and found a significant down-regulation of M-CSF and V-CAM1 in ALS, as well as up-regulation of VEGF-A protein. This phenotype was accompanied by an infiltration of MERTK positive macrophages into the parenchyma of the ALS-CP when compared to controls. Taken together, we demonstrate widespread structural and functional disruptions of the BCSFB in human ALS increasing our understanding of the disease pathology and identifying potential new targets for ALS therapeutic development.

[PMID: 32496971] Solid tumors have complex biology and structure comprising cancer cells, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix. While most therapeutics target the cancer cells, recent data suggest that cancer cell behavior and response to treatment are markedly influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME). In particular, the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant stromal cells, and play a significant contextual role in shaping tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. CAFs have therefore emerged as part of the next-generation cancer drug design and discovery innovation strategy. We report here new findings on differential expression and prognostic significance of CAF markers in several cancers. We utilized two publicly available resources: The Cancer Genomic Atlas and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis. We examined the expression of CAF markers, <i>ACTA2</i>, <i>S100A4</i>, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta [<i>PDGFR-β</i>], <i>CD10</i>, and fibroblast activation protein-alpha (<i>FAP-α</i>), in tumor tissues versus the adjacent normal tissues. We found that CAF markers were differentially expressed in various different tumors such as colon, breast, and esophageal cancers and melanoma. No CAF marker is expressed in the same pattern in all cancers, however. Importantly, we report that patients with colon adenocarcinoma and esophageal carcinoma expressing high <i>FAP-α</i> and <i>CD10</i>, respectively, had significantly shorter overall survival, compared with those with low levels of these CAF markers (<i>p</i> < 0.05). We call for continued research on TME biology and clinical evaluation of the CAF markers ACTA2, S100A4, PDGFR-β, CD10, and FAP-α in relation to prognosis of solid cancers in large population samples. An effective cancer drug design and discovery roadmap in the 21st century ought to be broadly framed, and include molecular targets informed by both cancer cell and TME variations.

[PMID: 32012801] Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by enhanced permeability of the air-blood barrier, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) was shown to be involved in pulmonary remodeling and the pathology of ALI, and we hypothesized that miR-21 knock-out (KO) reduces injury and remodeling in ALI. ALI was induced in miR-21 KO and C57BL/6N (wildtype, WT) mice by an intranasal administration of 75 µg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in saline (<i>n</i> = 10 per group). The control mice received saline alone (<i>n</i> = 7 per group). After 24 h, lung function was measured. The lungs were then excised for proteomics, cytokine, and stereological analysis to address inflammatory signaling and structural damage. LPS exposure induced ALI in both strains, however, only WT mice showed increased tissue resistance and septal thickening upon LPS treatment. Septal alterations due to LPS exposure in WT mice consisted of an increase in extracellular matrix (ECM), including collagen fibrils, elastic fibers, and amorphous ECM. Proteomics analysis revealed that the inflammatory response was dampened in miR-21 KO mice with reduced platelet and neutrophil activation compared with WT mice. The WT mice showed more functional and structural changes and inflammatory signaling in ALI than miR-21 KO mice, confirming the hypothesis that miR-21 KO reduces the development of pathological changes in ALI.

[PMID: 30897318] Vascular complications contribute significantly to the extensive morbidity and mortality rates observed in people with diabetes. Despite well known that the diabetic kidney and heart exhibit imbalanced angiogenesis, the mechanisms implicated in this angiogenic paradox remain unknown. In this study, we examined the angiogenic and metabolic gene expression profile (GEP) of endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from a mouse model with type1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). ECs were isolated from kidneys and hearts of healthy and streptozocin (STZ)-treated mice. RNA was then extracted for molecular studies. GEP of 84 angiogenic and 84 AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK)-dependent genes were examined by microarrays. Real time PCR confirmed the changes observed in significantly altered genes. Microvessel density (MVD) was analysed by immunohistochemistry, fibrosis was assessed by the Sirius red histological staining and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was quantified by ELISA. The relative percentage of ECs and MVD were increased in the kidneys of T1DM animals whereas the opposite trend was observed in the hearts of diabetic mice. Accordingly, the majority of AMPK-associated genes were upregulated in kidneys and downregulated in hearts of these animals. Angiogenic GEP revealed significant differences in Tgfβ, Notch signaling and Timp2 in both diabetic organs. These findings were in agreement with the angiogenesis histological assays. Fibrosis was augmented in both organs in diabetic as compared to healthy animals. Altogether, our findings indicate, for the first time, that T1DM heart and kidney ECs present opposite metabolic cues, which are accompanied by distinct angiogenic patterns. These findings enable the development of innovative organ-specific therapeutic strategies targeting diabetic-associated vascular disorders.",10
Converting apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing prevents the pathology associated with apoE4 in human iPSCderived neurons.,apoE4 AND apoE3 AND gene editing AND iPSC-derived neurons,"29632371,41186979,41186968,41186660,41186282,41186276,41185939,41185139,41185093,41185018","[PMID: 29632371] Efforts to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail in human trials, suggesting a pressing need to study AD in human model systems. Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.

[PMID: 41186979] Messenger RNA (mRNA) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a transformative technology with broad applications in vaccines, protein replacement therapy, and gene editing. However, the transient nature of mRNA expression often necessitates high or repeated dosing regimens, limiting its therapeutic potential. Thus, there is a critical need for innovation at the interface of RNA biology and drug delivery that prolong the duration of RNA translation. In this Viewpoint, we provide an overview of emerging nucleic acid cargos that address these challenges, specifically self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA), and provide a framework for how these nucleic acid cargos can enable the next generation of vaccines and therapeutics for diverse clinical applications.

[PMID: 41186968] Rice cooking and eating quality (CEQ), a core agronomic trait tied to consumer preference and market value, is regulated by endosperm starch, protein, and lipid metabolism; this review synthesizes advances in its molecular mechanisms, focusing on genetic determinants and regulatory networks of storage substances. Starch is key: the Wx gene (central hub) has ≥ 9 allelic variants (e.g., Wxᵃ, Wxᵇ and Wx<sup>ela</sup>), modulating amylose content (AC) via GBSSI activity, Wx gene expression levels, splicing efficiency, etc., and exerting pleiotropic effects on protein/lipid metabolism, grain transparency, and taste; storage proteins (80% glutelin) harm CEQ by inhibiting starch gelatinisation, regulated by relevant gene families and vesicular pathways (e.g., Rab5a-VPS9a); lipids (0.3%-3% of endosperm) affect Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) profiles and aroma via genes like OsFAD, PDCT, FGC3; modules (e.g., OsNF-Ys, OsbZIP60, Ghd7-OsNAC42) balance starch-protein accumulation. Breeding strategies include marker-assisted selection, CRISPR/Cas9 editing of Wx elements or glutelin genes, gene pyramiding (Wx, ALK, GS3), and artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated intelligent breeding to boost efficiency; the review first proposes a framework: 'Wx genotype determination - amylopectin/glutelin regulation - CEQ improvement', and the establishment of this framework is rooted in the core role of the Wx gene in determining rice eating quality, which is achieved through its pleiotropic regulation of starch, protein, and lipid metabolism in the endosperm. Future directions: use Wx allelic diversity, decipher multi-omics modules (e.g., RNA methylation in starch metabolism), and integrate aroma, Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), grain shape, chalkiness, sugar transport genes to balance yield and CEQ for rice breeding.

[PMID: 41186660] Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have survival benefits for patients with high-risk (High-risk disease is defined per the phase III OlympiA trial as follows: for triple-negative breast cancer, residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or node-positive or ≥ 2 cm tumors after adjuvant chemotherapy; for hormone receptor-positive disease, four or more positive nodes after adjuvant chemotherapy or a CPS + EG score ≥ 3 after incomplete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The CPS + EG score accounts for clinical/pathologic stage, ER status, and grade (Giaquinto et al. in CA Cancer J Clin 72:524-541, 2022)), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer (eBC) with germline BReast CAncer gene mutations (gBRCAm). However, many patients are unaware of their gBRCA status; this can impact eligibility for targeted treatment. We sought to evaluate patient preferences for BRCA testing and treatment decision-making as they relate to HER2-negative eBC. We conducted an online survey, including a best-worst scaling exercise (BWS) and discrete-choice experiment (DCE), among patients with self-reported HER2-negative eBC residing in the USA who were either untested, unsure if they were tested, or tested positive for the gBRCAm. The BWS generated a rank ordering of 16 barriers and facilitators to BRCA testing. The DCE evaluated patient preferences for adjuvant therapies versus no treatment based on seven treatment attributes: invasive disease-free survival, targeted treatment, nausea risk, risk of serious side effects, regimen, treatment duration, and cost. BWS and DCE exercises were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian models. Among the 359 women included in our sample, the top facilitators for BRCA testing were determining eligibility for targeted therapy that may prevent or delay metastasis, a physician's recommendation, and absence of out-of-pocket costs (OOPC). In contrast, the top barriers were an OOPC of $250, potential anxiety from test results, and the possibility of a 3- to 4-week delay in treatment. The DCE showed that most participants preferred adjuvant treatment (77.6%) over no treatment, and reducing treatment OOPC from $900 to $0, reducing the risk of serious side effects from 77 to 24%, and having a BRCA-targeted treatment influenced treatment choice most. Individuals reported that a key benefit of BRCA testing was the insight it provided into their treatment options, allowing for more personalized care. However, OOPC was a barrier to testing. Their choice to receive adjuvant therapy was most influenced by OOPC, followed by the tolerability of the treatment and the ability to receive a targeted therapy.

[PMID: 41186282] <i>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</i> is a chemolithoautotrophic acidophilic bacterium widely found in industrial biomining operations. The cells obtain energy through iron and/or sulfur oxidation, and the resulting ferric iron can solubilize copper and other critical materials. The genetic engineering of acidophiles including <i>A. ferrooxidans</i> remains challenging due to limited molecular tools. In this study, we explored the feasibility of retron-based genetic engineering tools in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i> ATCC23270, leveraging a <i>pBAD</i> promoter system for inducible gene expression. We successfully expressed retron elements in <i>Escherichia coli</i> using the broad host pJRD215 plasmid and demonstrated both RNA and DNA antisense interference. We then expressed retron elements in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i> and targeted RNA antisense interference of the <i>PetA2</i> gene, which is a <i>bc</i>1 complex gene involved in the sulfur metabolism electron transport chain. Engineered strains exhibited reduced expression of sulfur oxidation genes and increased iron oxidation under high sulfur conditions, demonstrating retron-mediated regulation. While transcriptional interference was evident, genome editing in concert with the addition of a single-stranded annealing protein (SSAP), or recombineering, was not detected in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i>. These findings establish retrons as a viable new tool for genetic modulation in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i><i>,</i> suggesting a new capability for metabolic engineering of acidophilic extremophiles.

[PMID: 41186276] Activation of natural killer (NK) cells by transformed targets requires the engagement of activating receptors and commonly a concomitant loss of inhibitory signaling. While the coactivating receptor DNAM-1 is involved in NK cell recognition of tumors expressing the nectin-like molecule CD155, in many cancer types, high expression of CD155 is associated with a poor clinical prognosis. To assess the impact of ligand density on NK cell function, recognition of target cells expressing low and high levels of CD155 was compared. While low levels of CD155 on target cells augmented NK cell activation, most evident in elevated IFN-γ responses, high levels of CD155 drove rapid, activation-induced downregulation of DNAM-1 that did not result in enhanced IFN-γ responses. High levels of CD155 also drove TIGIT loss from the NK cell surface; however, gene editing of TIGIT from primary NK cells had no significant impact on target cell recognition. Although low levels of CD155 induced a degree of DNAM-1 loss, the improved activation was still mediated through DNAM-1, as assessed through selective disruption of the interaction. Similarly, NK cell recognition of targets expressing the nectin CD112, which also engages both DNAM-1 and TIGIT, resulted in modest loss of DNAM-1 expression and heightened IFN-γ responses. Together, these observations suggest that DNAM-1 recognition of its ligands is delicately poised such that low avidity receptor engagement augments NK cell activation, and in particular IFN-γ responses, while stronger engagement can result in the rapid downregulation of DNAM-1 without any significant enhancement of effector responses.

[PMID: 41185939] Despite the tremendous potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology in precision therapeutics, intracellular delivery remains a major challenge. High cytoplasmic viscosity and lysosomal entrapment significantly impair the cytosolic transport and gene-editing efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate that both the size and magnetic responsiveness of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters can be finely tuned by modulating ionic strength, enabling their rapid propulsion under external magnetic fields. Leveraging this property, we develop magnetic nanoparticle cluster nanorobots (MagCbots) of approximately 200 nm in size by electrostatically assembling Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids. Under magnetic actuation, MagCbots exhibit rapid rotation in highly viscous intracellular environments, achieving a linear velocity of ∼0.41 μm/s. MagCbots reduce intracellular viscosity by approximately 50% and enhance lysosomal escape efficiency by 3-fold compared to nonactuated counterparts. Their porous architecture not only offers high payload capacity but also protects plasmid DNA from enzymatic degradation. Notably, MagCbots enable efficient genome editing of both PD1 and PLK1 genes across various cell lines including hard-to-transfect Jurkat T cells. This magnetically driven nanorobot platform presents a promising strategy for active intracellular delivery and holds significant potential for advancing gene therapy and related biomedical applications.

[PMID: 41185139] Myhre syndrome is a rare, multisystemic disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SMAD4 gene, a key component of the TGF-β signaling pathway. These mutations lead to manifestations affecting neurodevelopment, bone and joint development, fibrosis and stenosis, immune responses, reproductive health, and cardiac function. The Myhre Syndrome Foundation (MSF) is a patient-centered organization focused on accelerating drug discovery while supporting patients, prioritizing research targeting fibrosis/stenosis and autism/intellectual and developmental disabilities, the most significant burdens reported by patients. Their short-term strategy involves: (1) Creating and running a preclinical platform to screen potential treatments using patient-derived and animal models. (2) Clinical readiness, addressing challenges associated with low disease incidence and heterogeneity in clinical trial design, by developing multi-domain endpoints, responder index, and biobanks/biomarkers. (3) Target identification investigating SMAD4 pathogenic variants rewiring protein-protein interactions in key signaling pathways. (4) Fostering partnerships with regulatory authorities, industries, and other patient research organizations. The MSF portfolio includes targeting fibrosis with immunotherapy using FAP-CAR-T cells, and a precision medicine approach aimed at restoring normal SMAD4 function through gene editing and small molecules. MSF aims to develop therapies that address both acute and chronic manifestations of this complex disease, improving the quality of life for affected individuals.

[PMID: 41185093] Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the apoE4 isoform (C112R) represents the strongest genetic risk factor. We combined binding-site mapping and discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations to elucidate isoform-specific apoE-Aβ interactions. Computational peptide-array analysis identified Aβ-binding hotspots in the apoE4 N-terminal domain (NTD) around R112, conferring greater Aβ-binding propensity than apoE3. DMD simulations showed that apoE4 NTD is less stable and more solvent-exposed, resulting in stronger Aβ binding, especially near the mutation site. Upon binding apoE NTDs, Aβ exhibited an increased β-sheet content, suggesting a lowered fibril nucleation barrier. Incorporating these insights into a recently established thermodynamic-kinetic framework of amyloid aggregation rationalizes apoE's biphasic effect on Aβ aggregation: apoE retards Aβ fibrillization at low Aβ-concentrations via monomer sequestration but accelerates the process at high concentrations by facilitating nucleation. Our findings offer mechanistic insight into the APOE genotype-dependent modulation of Aβ aggregation and may inform genotype-specific therapeutic strategies for AD.

In this study, we showed that emitted VOCs discriminate between uncontaminated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and those contaminated with the bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis or fungus Aspergillus Fumigatus separately, in vitro, using a methodology based on an adapted cell culture and thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). In addition, we elucidated a set of discriminatory volatile compounds from the MSC cultures and media alone across a time series experiment. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-variable importance in projection confirmed putative identifications of 18, 16, and 26 VOCs that showed relevant changes in a bacterial, fungal, and universal pathogen model, respectively, with an accuracy of 100% in the fungal model. Among these metabolites, octane, 2,5,6-trimethyl- overlapped between the three groups. Furthermore, a total of 15 VOCs were found most relevant to cell culture expansion over three days based on cluster analysis. This novel study goes a step further in identifying distinct VOC signatures of MSCs contaminated with S. epidermidis or A. fumigatus, and in monitoring MSCs proliferation over time. This pilot study shows preliminary results that indicate that VOC headspace analysis could serve as a suitable, rapid, non-invasive, and non-destructive tool for the metabolic and growth monitoring of MSCs in a dynamic cell culture bioreactor system.

[PMID: 41185687] Osteoarthritis (OA), a prevalent degenerative inflammatory joint disorder, imposes a substantial global health burden, affecting over 500 million people worldwide and representing a leading cause of pain and disability. Its pathogenesis is characterized by the progressive degradation of articular cartilage, concomitant synovitis, and aberrant subchondral bone remodeling. Contemporary management strategies primarily aim to alleviate symptoms rather than halt disease progression, underscoring the critical need to elucidate fundamental pathogenic mechanisms to identify novel therapeutic targets. Recently, pyroptosis-a lytic, pro-inflammatory cell death mediated by inflammasomes (eg, NLRP3) and gasdermin D (GSDMD)- has emerged as a key mechanism linking inflammation to tissue damage. This review integrates pyroptosis research with OA pathomechanisms to establish their interplay. This review synthesizes contemporary research to delineate the intricate interplay between pyroptosis and OA pathomechanisms across joint tissues. Our integration of evidence reveals that: (1) The pyroptosis-inflammation axis involves NLRP3 activation, caspase cleavage, and GSDMD pore formation, releasing IL-1β/IL-18 that amplify synovitis and tissue destruction; (2) Chondrocyte pyroptosis is regulated by NF-κB and Hedgehog signaling, suppressible by inhibitors (eg, loganin); (3) Synovial cells undergo pyroptosis under stimuli like LPS, perpetuating fibrosis via HIF-1α activation; (4) Subchondral bone pyroptosis disrupts remodeling, targetable via PI3K/AKT pathways.

[PMID: 41185562] Senescence is a cellular response closely associated with genotoxic stress and plays a critical role in determining cell fate following irradiation exposure. Primary cilia, which are sensory organelles on the cell surface, detect and transmit diverse signaling cues. However, the relationship between primary cilia and senescence in long-term cell fate decisions after ionizing radiation (IR) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) colocalizes with centromeres during various stages of mitosis, whereas during interphase, phosphorylated DNA-PKcs (p-DNA-PKcs) is confined to the nucleus in tumor cells. Following irradiation exposure, primary cilia are formed and persistently maintained at high levels in senescent tumor cells. Inhibition of DNA-PKcs enhances primary cilia formation, whereas combined inhibition with siDNA-PKcs and irradiation reduces cilia generation. Moreover, chloral hydrate-induced primary cilia removal results in senescent cell death and decreases p-DNA-PKcs protein expression. Notably, treatment with the apoptosis inducer ABT263 also leads to increased cell death and decreased incidence of primary cilia. Inhibition of either primary cilia or DNA-PKcs further enhances the radiosensitivity of tumor cells. These findings suggest that DNA-PKcs contributes to primary cilia formation after irradiation and plays a critical role in both the induction and maintenance of cellular senescence.

[PMID: 41185301] The objective of this study is to use synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence imaging (XFI) and bulk analysis to investigate elements (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, P, S, K, Ca) distributions and relative concentrations in four cool-season oat varieties (CDC Arborg, CDC Nasser, CDC Haymaker, and Summit) obtained from the same growing location, soil conditions and harvest time at the University of Saskatchewan. XFI at the Canadian Light Source's BioXAS-Imaging beamline (5 μm resolution, 15 keV) revealed that P, K, Mn, and Zn were concentrated in the aleurone layer, scutellum, and embryo, while Ca was only localized in the aleurone layer and scutellum in the four oat varieties. Notably, S and Cu were distributed in all parts of the seed across four varieties, but the intensity was low in the endosperm. Bulk analysis results show that there were significant differences in the relative concentrations of K, Fe and Zn among four oat varieties harvested for three consecutive years (2018, 2019, 2020) at the completely mature stage. CDC Nasser oat had the lowest K and Zn, while CDC Haymaker had the highest Fe among the oat varieties. These findings highlight the impact of variety on nutritional quality and could help inform future biofortification strategies to enhance the micronutrient content for human and animal diets. This work is the first to map the oat mineral distributions across cool-season varieties using high-resolution XFI. Unlike rice, oats showed minimal mineral accumulation in the hull, ensuring nutritional retention post-milling. Overall, this study shows XFI's potential as a non-destructive tool for cereal grain analysis and supports breeding nutrient-dense oat varieties to address global micronutrient deficiencies.

[PMID: 41185246] Ultrasonic detection serves as a significant non-destructive testing method in industrial manufacturing. Quasi-distributed acoustic sensing (QDAS) offers promise for cost-effective, large-scale ultrasonic sensor arrays owing to its superior array integration capability. In this study, we implement an optical coherence domain reflectometry (OCDR) system incorporating frequency-division multiplexing to detect ultrasonic pulses propagating in metal plates via an optical fiber with weak reflectors. This strategy drastically reduces the receiver bandwidth requirement for QDAS systems. We demonstrate 1 MHz ultrasonic pulse detection over 2 km fiber with the receiver bandwidth compressed to several MHz. The proposed system significantly enhances the feasibility of QDAS for ultrasonic flaw detection, imaging, and other fields.

[PMID: 41185072] Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to insulin deficiency. As insulin therapy does not affect disease progression, advancements in immune regulation therapies have emerged, including the reconstitution of the insulin secretory system. Cysteine-rich acidic secretory protein (SPARC) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that regulates cell adhesion, facilitating cell migration, and mediating interactions between cells and their extracellular matrix. SPARC is overexpressed during tissue repair and is involved in β-cells survival. However, the potential of SPARC-modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to improve insulin secretion has not been thoroughly investigated. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of SPARC-MSCs in vivo and in vitro and assessed whether SPARC enhances survival and insulin secretion after β-cells injury. In vivo, we established T1D models in mice and canine using SPARC-MSCs for cell transplantation. In vitro, MIN6 cells were damaged with STZ, and SPARC-MSC supernatant was co-cultured with MIN6 for various assays. Our study demonstrated that SPARC enhanced the regenerative capacity and migratory efficiency of MSCs after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> injury and improved their morphology. In STZ-induced canine and mice diabetes models, SPARC-MSCs therapy significantly reduced hyperglycemia, improved oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and reversed weight loss in canine. Biochemical analyses showed improved liver function, and histological examination revealed restored islet area was significantly restored. Transcriptome and proteome sequencing indicated significant enrichment in calcium binding and cell migration pathways. Co-culturing SPARC-MSC supernatant with MIN6 cells after STZ injury restored their regenerative ability, enhancing insulin secretion and ATP content under high glucose stimulation. SPARC treatment also significantly increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in MIN6 cells. SPARC significantly promotes cell regeneration and stimulates insulin secretion by increasing intracellular ATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. In diabetic canine and mice models, it alleviated hyperglycemia, improved glucose tolerance, and enhanced pancreatic islet area and insulin secretion.

[PMID: 41184589] During development, stem and progenitor cells divide and transition through multipotent states to generate the diverse cell types by undergoing defined changes in biomolecular composition, which underlie the progressive loss of potency and acquisition of lineage-specific characteristics. For example, the cardiac and pharyngeal muscle programs are jointly primed in multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors, and segregate in distinct daughter cells only after cell division. Here, using the tunicate Ciona, we showed that multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors acquire the competence to produce distinct Tbx1/10 (+) and (-) daughter cells shortly before mitosis, which is necessary for Tbx1/10 activation. By combining transgene-based sample barcoding with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we uncovered transcriptome-wide dynamics in migrating cardiopharyngeal progenitors as cells progress through G1, S, and G2 phases. We refer to this process as ""transcriptome maturation"", and identified candidate mature genes, including the Rho GAP-coding gene Depdc1b, which peaks in late G2. Functional assays indicated that transcriptome maturation fosters cardiopharyngeal competence, in part through multilineage priming and by enabling asymmetric cell division that influences subsequent fate decisions, illustrating the concept of ""behavioral competence"". We show that both classic regulatory circuits and coupling with the G1-S transition drive transcriptome maturation, ensuring the timely deployment of lineage-specific programs.

[PMID: 41184430] The composite materials are widely used across industries however, these materials are prone to damages like cracking and delamination due to its complexity. The Electromechanical Impedance (EMI) technique offers a reliable non-destructive solution for detecting such damage using piezoelectric sensors and enabling effective structural health monitoring and enhancing safety and durability. This study explores the application of the EMI technique for monitoring damages in composite fibre concrete specimens. The specimens were prepared using Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), fly ash, and polypropylene, glass fiber mixture, water, fine and coarse aggregates. The Piezoelectric sensors were employed to record conductance and susceptance signatures, enabling early detection and quantification of damages. The severity of damages were assessed using statistical indices such as Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Mean Absolute Percentage Deviation (MAPD), and Correlation Coefficient (CC) revealing higher sensitivity. A notable leftward shift in EMI signatures with increasing damage was confirmed progressive structural degradation. Additionally, structural parameters equivalent stiffness and equivalent damping were evaluated, demonstrating a decrease in stiffness and an increase in damping with greater damage depth. Temperature effects on EMI responses were also investigated, necessitating compensation for reliable analysis. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was trained using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and implemented to predict conductance values and damage depth. The developed ANN showed high accuracy, with strong agreement between experimental and predicted results. Overall, the findings confirm the EMI technique's potential for SHM of composite fiber concrete and integration with machine learning for improved predictive its durability assessment.

[PMID: 41184301] Cyclin A2 (CCNA2), a master cell cycle regulator silenced in postnatal cardiomyocytes, promotes cardiac repair in animal models. However, its effect on cytokinesis in adult human cardiomyocytes was previously unknown. We engineered a replication-deficient adenoviral vector encoding human CCNA2 under the cardiac Troponin T promoter and delivered it to freshly isolated cardiomyocytes from adult human hearts. Time-lapse live imaging revealed the induction of complete cytokinesis with preservation of sarcomeres and calcium mobilization in redifferentiated daughter cardiomyocytes. Single-nucleus transcriptomic profiling of CCNA2-transgenic and non-transgenic mouse hearts uncovered a cardiomyocyte subpopulation characterized by enrichment of cytokinesis, proliferation, and reprogramming gene signatures. Ultra-deep bulk RNA sequencing of adult and fetal human hearts further highlighted reprogramming pathways relevant to CCNA2-induced effects. Together, these findings demonstrate that CCNA2 can reinitiate cytokinesis in adult human cardiomyocytes, illuminating conserved molecular programs that support its promise as a regenerative gene therapy for the heart.

[PMID: 41184261] Optical patterning of quantum dots is essential for the fabrication of light-emitting diodes displays. However, current patterning methods either require inert environments or compromised quantum dots optical properties under ambient conditions. Here, we report a photoresist-free strategy enabling direct quantum dot patterning in air by using triphenylphosphine, a cost-effective, commercially available molecule that functions simultaneously as a surface ligand, photoinitiator, and oxidation protector. Under light exposure, triphenylphosphine reacts with atmospheric oxygen to trigger solubility changes, allowing precise patterning with resolutions up to 9534 dpi. The resulting devices exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 21.6% (blue), 25.6% (green), and 20.2% (red). We further demonstrate full-color active-matrix quantum dots light-emitting diodes displays by integrating the patterned red, green and blue quantum dots with thin-film transistor backplanes. This work offers a scalable, non-destructive, and environmentally compatible patterning solution for industrial display technologies.",10
DUSP4 increases apoptosis.,DUSP4 AND apoptosis AND regulation of apoptosis AND DUSP4 function,"40241046,39639217,38824257,36705792,36234680,35361955,35189148,34299042,34254709,33760201","[PMID: 40241046] Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a highly fatal pathophysiological syndrome. The group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by acute pulmonary vasoconstriction and chronic vascular remodeling caused by hyperplasia and hypertrophy of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and chronic inflammation. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory mode of cell death that is regulated by super-enhancers (SEs) and occurs in the setting of tumors and cardiovascular diseases. However, whether SEs are involved in the pathological process of pyroptosis in PAH and the specific mechanism involved remain unclear. Here, we identified the SE target gene DUSP4 via ChIP-seq with an anti-H3K27ac antibody, and bioinformatics predictions revealed that the transcription factor PITX1 can bind to the promoter and SE sequences of DUSP4. The AAV5 vector was used to deliver shRNAs targeting PITX1 and DUSP4 to PASMCs. PITX1 overexpression reversed the increase in right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary vascular remodeling, restored the PAAT/PAVTI ratio in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH, Group 3 PH) and SuHx PAH (Group 1 PAH) mice, and suppressed pyroptosis in pulmonary vascular cells. However, knockdown of DUSP4 counteracted the effects of PITX1 overexpression. Similar results were obtained in cultured PASMCs. In addition, treatment with the SE inhibitors JQ1 and iBET decreased the transcription of DUSP4 and increased the expression of hypoxia-induced pyroptosis proteins in PASMCs. We confirmed that PITX1 can promote DUSP4 expression by binding to the DUSP4 promoter and SE to reduce pyroptosis in hypoxic PASMCs, providing new insights into the role of SEs and pyroptosis in pulmonary vascular remodeling and a theoretical basis for the treatment of PAH and related diseases.

[PMID: 39639217] Radiotherapy (RT) is an important means of local treatment of solid tumors, and radioresistance is the main reason for RT failure for tumors, especially pancreatic cancer (PC). It is urgent to distinguish key genes and mechanisms of radioresistance in PC. We acquired the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), obtained the gene modules associated with radioresistance by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and tumor samples. Radioresistance-related genes (RRRGs) were determined with the intersection of WGCNA and DEGs. The hub RRRGs associated with prognosis were distinguished by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. We established a risk score model using multivariate Cox regression. Immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity were evaluated through the CIBERSORT algorithm and the ""OncoPredict"" software package, respectively. The association of the key gene RIC3 and PC clinical features was verified in public databases, and its biological behaviors were explored in vitro. The intersection of DEGs and WGCNA confirmed 14 RRRGs, then six hub RRRGs were identified using LASSO. A key four genes (DUSP4, ADORA2B, SCGB2A1, and RIC3) risk score model was constructed and proved to be capable of independently estimating the prognosis of PC. There is no significant difference between risk score groups in various immune cell infiltration and response to immunotherapy. Although the low-risk group seemed to exhibit greater sensitivity to antitumor drugs, the four drugs (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) currently used for PC patients had no statistical difference for the low- and high- group. The overexpression of RIC3 had a synergy effect with irradiation on inhibited malignant biological properties of PC cells, which was verified by detecting the proliferation ability, apoptosis rate, cell cycle distribution, and migration ability of PANC-1 cells. We herein presented signature genes correlated with radioresistance in PC and established a risk score model competent in estimating patients' clinical outcomes and response to antitumor drugs. The above evidence could contribute to comprehending the mechanisms of radioresistance and identifying the underlying therapy targeting.

[PMID: 38824257] Previous studies have demonstrated that Dual-specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) plays an important role in the progression of different tumor types. However, the role and mechanism of DUSP4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. We investigate the role and mechanisms of DUSP4 in CRC. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate DUSP4 expression in CRC tissues. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration assays were used to validate DUSP4 function in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequence assay was used to identify the target genes of DUSP4. Human phosphokinase array and inhibitor assays were used to explore the downstream signaling of DUSP4. DUSP4 expression was upregulated in CRC tissues relative to normal colorectal tissues, and DUSP4 expression showed a significant positive correlation with CRC stage. Consistently, we found that DUSP4 was highly expressed in colorectal cancer cells compared to normal cells. DUSP4 knockdown inhibits CRC cell proliferation, migration and promotes apoptosis. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of DUSP4 enhanced CRC cell proliferation, migration and diminished apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Human phosphokinase array data showed that ectopic expression of DUSP4 promotes CREB activation. RNA-sequencing data showed that PRKACB acts as a downstream target gene of DUSP4/CREB and enhances CREB activation through PKA/cAMP signaling. In addition, xenograft model results demonstrated that DUSP4 promotes colorectal tumor progression via PRKACB/CREB activation in vivo. These findings suggest that DUSP4 promotes CRC progression. Therefore, it may be a promising therapeutic target for CRC.

[PMID: 36705792] The DUSP4 gene plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanism of DUSP4-regulated colorectal carcinogenesis is unknown. DUSP4 is a negative regulator of the MAP kinase (MAPK) JNK, and JNK-mediated BCL2 phosphorylation is associated with apoptosis and autophagic cell death. Our study aimed to explore the significance of BCL2 phosphorylation-dependent autophagy and apoptosis in DUSP4-promoted colorectal carcinogenesis. We first investigated the roles of DUSP4 in the survival of HCT116 and SW480 CRC cell lines using gene-silencing and -overexpression techniques. Next, we explored the effects of DUSP4 on the BCL2 phosphorylation, autophagy and apoptosis of HCT116 and SW480 cells. Ultimately, with the help of pharmacological inhibitors of Beclin1 and BCL2 (spautin-1 and ABT-737), the relationship between BCL2-Beclin1/Bax signaling and DUSP4-regulated autophagy, apoptosis, survival and migration in HCT116 cells was clarified. Our results first confirmed the contribution of DUSP4 to the survival of HCT116 and SW480 cells. In addition, DUSP4 silencing resulted in BCL2 phosphorylation and the enhancement in autophagy and apoptosis in HCT116 and SW480 cells, while DUSP4 overexpression showed the opposite effect. Moreover, DUSP4 silencing inhibited the protein interaction between BCL2 and Beclin1 or Bax in HCT116 cells. Moreover, the survival and migration of HCT116 cells inhibited by DUSP4 silencing were blocked by autophagy inhibition with spautin-1. Notably, the survival and migration of HCT116 cells promoted by DUSP4 overexpression were reversed by ABT-737. It was indicated that DUSP4 can maintain the survival and function of CRC cells by inhibiting BCL2 phosphorylation-dependent autophagic cell death and apoptosis.

[PMID: 36234680] Doxorubicin (Dox) has limited efficiency in breast cancer (BC) due to drug-acquired resistance. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a major role in the survival and drug resistance of cancer cells. It was suggested that the JNK pathway was implicated in the response to Dox by regulating EMT. DUSP4/or MKP-2 is a well-known regulator of the JNK pathway and was found to be highly expressed in BC. However, its functional significance is not yet fully understood. In the present study, the possible involvement of MKP-2 in Dox-induced EMT was investigated in breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry for tissues obtained from BC patients (<i>n</i> = 108) revealed 71.3% of tissues stained positively for MKP-2 while only 28.7% stained negatively. However, MKP-2 protein expression exhibited no significant relationship between BC prognostic factors, such as histological grade, histological type, hormonal status, and Ki-67 marker, its expression was significantly correlated with age 40 or below. In MDA-MB-231 cells, Dox-induced phosphorylation of JNK was sufficiently enhanced in MKP-2 silenced cells. This resulted in the attenuation of Dox-induced EMT, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately accelerated apoptosis. It was confirmed that the acquisition of Dox sensitivity by MKP-2 silencing largely depends on the stimulation of the JNK pathway. Indeed, results showed that overexpressing MKP-2 in non-tumorigenic MCF-12A cells dramatically inhibited Dox-induced JNK activation and, subsequently, cell death. The present study, to our knowledge, is the first to provide evidence for the potential role of MKP-2 in chemoresistance to Dox through modulating the JNK pathway and enhancing EMT.

[PMID: 35361955] Efferocytosis, the clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) by macrophages, is critical for tissue resolution, with defects driving many diseases. Mechanisms of efferocytosis-mediated resolution are incompletely understood. Here, we show that AC-derived methionine regulates resolution through epigenetic repression of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphatase Dusp4. We focus on two key efferocytosis-induced pro-resolving mediators, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), and show that efferocytosis induces prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2/cyclooxygenase 2 (Ptgs2/COX2), leading to PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis and PGE<sub>2</sub>-mediated induction of TGF-β1. ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation by AC-activated CD36 is necessary for Ptgs2 induction, but this is insufficient owing to an ERK-DUSP4 negative feedback pathway that lowers phospho-ERK. However, subsequent AC engulfment and phagolysosomal degradation lead to Dusp4 repression, enabling enhanced p-ERK and induction of the Ptgs2-PGE<sub>2</sub>-TGF-β1 pathway. Mechanistically, AC-derived methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine, which is used by DNA methyltransferase-3A (DNMT3A) to methylate Dusp4. Bone-marrow DNMT3A deletion in mice blocks COX2/PGE<sub>2</sub>, TGF-β1, and resolution in sterile peritonitis, apoptosis-induced thymus injury and atherosclerosis. Knowledge of how macrophages use AC-cargo and epigenetics to induce resolution provides mechanistic insight and therapeutic options for diseases driven by impaired resolution.

[PMID: 35189148] A subset of dual-specificity phosphatases is a major negative regulator of MAPKs, and their involvement in tumorigenesis remains controversial. Among them, DUSP4 is reported to preferentially dephosphorylate extracellular signal‒regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase over p38. In this study, we aimed to identify a possible role of DUSP4 in melanoma genesis. An examination of large-scale public data on gene expression and dependency revealed a considerably high DUSP4 expression and dependency of the melanoma cell lines compared with those of other tumor cell lines, which was not apparent for the other 24 dual-specificity phosphatases genes encoded in the human genome. Using two melanoma lines, we confirmed that DUSP4 depletion impaired cell growth without notably inducing apoptosis. Interestingly, immunoblotting and kinase translocation reporter data revealed that DUSP4 depletion induces a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation but barely affects c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, suggesting that neither ERK nor c-Jun N-terminal kinase is a direct target of DUSP4 in our experimental setting. Notably, DUSP4 depletion led to an increase in DUSP6 level, possibly through a post-transcriptional process, and DUSP6 knockout almost eliminated the DUSP4-depletion effect on cell growth and ERK activity. Our findings suggest that DUSP4 plays a role in maintaining a high ERK1/2 activity by negatively regulating DUSP6 and thus contributes to the survival and growth of melanoma cells.

[PMID: 34299042] Diarylpentanoid (DAP), an analog that was structurally modified from a naturally occurring curcumin, has shown to enhance anticancer efficacy compared to its parent compound in various cancers. This study aims to determine the cytotoxicity, antiproliferative, and apoptotic activity of diarylpentanoid MS13 on two subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells: squamous cell carcinoma (NCI-H520) and adenocarcinoma (NCI-H23). Gene expression analysis was performed using Nanostring PanCancer Pathways Panel to determine significant signaling pathways and targeted genes in these treated cells. Cytotoxicity screening revealed that MS13 exhibited greater inhibitory effect in NCI-H520 and NCI-H23 cells compared to curcumin. MS13 induced anti-proliferative activity in both cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Morphological analysis revealed that a significant number of MS13-treated cells exhibited apoptosis. A significant increase in caspase-3 activity and decrease in Bcl-2 protein concentration was noted in both MS13-treated cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A total of 77 and 47 differential expressed genes (DEGs) were regulated in MS13 treated-NCI-H520 and NCI-H23 cells, respectively. Among the DEGs, 22 were mutually expressed in both NCI-H520 and NCI-H23 cells in response to MS13 treatment. The top DEGs modulated by MS13 in NCI-H520-DUSP4, CDKN1A, GADD45G, NGFR, and EPHA2-and NCI-H23 cells-HGF, MET, COL5A2, MCM7, and GNG4-were highly associated with PI3K, cell cycle-apoptosis, and MAPK signaling pathways. In conclusion, MS13 may induce antiproliferation and apoptosis activity in squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of NSCLC cells by modulating DEGs associated with PI3K-AKT, cell cycle-apoptosis, and MAPK pathways. Therefore, our present findings could provide an insight into the anticancer activity of MS13 and merits further investigation as a potential anticancer agent for NSCLC cancer therapy.

[PMID: 34254709] Dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), a member of the dual specificity phosphatase family, is responsible for the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ERK, JNK and p38, which are mitogen-activated protein kinases involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, but also in inflammation processes. Given its importance for cellular signalling, DUSP4 is subjected to a tight regulation and there is growing evidence that its expression is dysregulated in several tumours. However, the mechanisms underlying DUSP4 transcriptional regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we analysed the regulation of the human DUSP4 promoters 1 and 2, located upstream of exons 1 and 2, respectively, by the cancer-related transcription factors (TFs) STAT3, FOXA1, CTCF and YY1. The presence of binding sites for these TFs was predicted in both promoters through the in silico analysis of DUSP4, and their functionality was assessed through luciferase activity assays. Regulatory activity of the TFs tested was found to be promoter-specific. While CTCF stimulated the activity of promoter 2 that controls the transcription of variants 2 and X1, STAT3 stimulated the activity of promoter 1 that controls the transcription of variant 1. YY1 positively regulated both promoters, although to different extents. Through site-directed mutagenesis, the functionality of YY1 binding sites present in promoter 2 was confirmed. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulation of DUSP4, contributing to a better comprehension of the mechanisms of its dysregulation observed in several types of cancer.

[PMID: 33760201] MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play an important role in regulating the occurrence and development of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). miR‑122‑5p is widely considered a tumour inhibitor, which has not been fully explored in PTC. Bioinformatics analysis identified dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), a tumour promoter gene for PTC, as a downstream target of miR‑122‑5p. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of miR‑122‑5p in PTC oncogenesis. In this study, the expression pattern of miR‑122‑5p in PTC cancer tissues and PTC cell lines was investigated via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the roles of miR‑122‑5p in PTC were explored using gain‑of‑function and loss‑of‑function assays. The results revealed that the expression of miR‑122‑5p was significantly lower in PTC cancer tissues, especially in cancer tissues with significant invasion or metastasis. Overexpression of miR‑122‑5p caused by miR‑122‑5p mimics inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of the PTC cell line K1, while knockdown of miR‑122‑5p by miR‑122‑5p inhibitors exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> assays revealed that miR‑122‑5p overexpression inhibited tumour growth. In addition, miR‑122‑5p was negatively correlated with DUSP4 expression in PTC cancer tissues. miR‑122‑5p overexpression inhibited DUSP4 expression in K1 cells, while miR‑122‑5p downregulation produced the inverse effect. Specifically, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding sites of miR‑122‑5p on the 3'‑UTR of DUSP4, demonstrating the targeting effect of miR‑122‑5p on DUSP4. miR‑122‑5p inhibited the oncogenesis of PTC by targeting DUSP4, revealing the potential application value of miR‑122‑5p in the diagnosis and treatment of PTC.",10
Depletion of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection increases dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium from the gut.,Th17 cells AND SIV infection AND Salmonella Typhimurium AND gut dissemination,"20543591,18376406,41187080,41186155,41185563,41185363,41185294,41184436,41183489,41183066","[PMID: 20543591] We discuss studies on a subset of CD4T cells, designated Th17, and their role in the pathogenesis of human and simian acquired immune deficiency, caused by infection with HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), respectively. Most of the Th17 cells are lost within 2 weeks from infection at mucosal sites of SIV-infected macaques and are not replenished over time. Comparison of simian pathogenic and nonpathogenic models of SIV infection suggests that Th17 cells contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS. Th17 cells, a recently identified subset of T helper cells, play a major role in both inducing autoimmune disorders and fencing off extracellular pathogens. Several groups have reported that the number of Th17 cells is decreased in the gut of HIV-infected and SIV-infected hosts. The loss of Th17 cells from the mucosal compartment has been associated with the dissemination of Salmonella typhimurium that is normally contained locally by the host immune system. It is believed that microbial translocation sustains immune activation in HIV infection and contributes to AIDS. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to disruption of mucosal integrity, viral spread, and chronic immune activation is of crucial importance for the design of efficient vaccines and therapeutic intervention for HIV.

[PMID: 18376406] Salmonella typhimurium causes a localized enteric infection in immunocompetent individuals, whereas HIV-infected individuals develop a life-threatening bacteremia. Here we show that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in depletion of T helper type 17 (TH17) cells in the ileal mucosa of rhesus macaques, thereby impairing mucosal barrier functions to S. typhimurium dissemination. In SIV-negative macaques, the gene expression profile induced by S. typhimurium in ligated ileal loops was dominated by TH17 responses, including the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-22. TH17 cells were markedly depleted in SIV-infected rhesus macaques, resulting in blunted TH17 responses to S. typhimurium infection and increased bacterial dissemination. IL-17 receptor-deficient mice showed increased systemic dissemination of S. typhimurium from the gut, suggesting that IL-17 deficiency causes defects in mucosal barrier function. We conclude that SIV infection impairs the IL-17 axis, an arm of the mucosal immune response preventing systemic microbial dissemination from the gastrointestinal tract.

[PMID: 41187080] Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP) plays a critical role in host defense against invading pathogens, including <i><i>Listeria</i> monocytogenes (<i>Listeria. monocytogenes</i>)</i>, <i><i>Salmonella typhimurium (<i>S. typhimurium</i>)</i></i>, and <i>Francisella novicida (<i>F. novicida</i>)</i>. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms controlling LAP remain poorly understood. Here, we identify enkurin domain-containing protein 1 (ENKD1) as a key negative regulator of LAP during infection with these pathogens. Macrophages infected with <i><i>L.</i> monocytogenes</i> (10403S), <i>S. typhimurium</i> (ATCC14028), or <i>F. novicida</i> (U112) exhibit significant ENKD1 downregulation. ENKD1-deficient macrophages display enhanced antibacterial activity, characterized by increased LAP, higher reactive oxygen species production, enhanced LC3 lipidation on phagosomes, and improved phagosome-lysosome fusion. In vivo, ENKD1<i>-</i>deficient mice <i>ex</i>hibited improved bacterial clearance in the liver and spleen, with notable survival benefits. Mechanistically, ENKD1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), which mediates degradation of Run domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein (RUBCN) through K48-linked polyubiquitination, thereby dampening RUBCN's role in LAP. Our findings reveal an ENKD1-TRIM21-RUBCN axis that suppresses LAP, providing insights into antibacterial immune regulation and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to enhance host defense against intracellular pathogens.

[PMID: 41186155] Molecular chaperones play a critical role in proteostasis by aiding the folding of newly synthesized proteins and the refolding of misfolded proteins. Cells must match the protein synthesis rate to the protein folding capacity to avoid the accumulation of unfolded proteins that can form toxic aggregates. The Hsp70 chaperone DnaK binds to ribosomes and decreases protein synthesis in the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium when facing cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation, an infection-relevant stress that disrupts proteostasis. DnaK decreases protein synthesis independently of J-domain cochaperones and nucleotide exchange factor GrpE even though J-domain cochaperones and GrpE are required for DnaK's canonical role in protein folding and refolding. DnaK's activity contrasts with that exhibited by the bacteria-specific chaperone trigger factor, which associates with ribosomes and carries out cotranslational protein folding in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-abundant conditions. Under infection-relevant conditions, the master regulator of S. typhimurium virulence and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis PhoP promotes the expression of DnaK, but not of J-domain cochaperones, GrpE, or trigger factor, suggesting that the differential expression of chaperones and cochaperones furthers S. typhimurium pathogenesis. Hsp70 chaperones also associate with ribosomes in eukaryotic cells but instead promote protein synthesis, the opposite effect that DnaK binding to ribosomes has in bacteria. Thus, Hsp70 chaperone activity differs across growth conditions and among organisms.

This report summarizes the results of the Swiss national program for surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs by presenting data on their genetic diversity and on transmissions to humans between 2010 and 2022. Challenges and optimization options in the program are discussed. Nasal swabs or lung tissue samples from pigs with influenza-like signs were screened by real-time RT-PCR for swine influenza virus (SIV) genomes and the human seasonal strain A(H1N1)pdm09; positive samples were subtyped for H1, N1, H3 and N2. In parallel, humans with influenza-like symptoms and recent contact with diseased pigs were asked to sample themselves with a nasal swab. Human swabs were tested for IAV, and positive swabs further subtyped to identify potential cross-species transmission between swine and humans. In the pigs, SIV was detected in 375 of 674 farm visits. H1N1 was the only subtype detected in Swiss pigs so far. The human seasonal strain A(H1N1)pdm09 (Hemagglutinin (HA) clade 1A) was detected in seven out of 375 SIV positive farm visits. Phylogenetic analyses from partial HA and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences indicate that the remaining pigs were infected with the Eurasian avian lineage (HA clade 1C), which is predominant in swine in Europe. The Swiss H1N1 strains form distinct phylogenetic clusters within HA clades 1C.2.1 and 1C.2.2 and seem to evolve comparably slowly. Infection of humans with SIV was identified in five cases. Sequence similarity analysis assigned the five viruses to the Eurasian avian lineage (C), clades 1C.2.1 and 1C.2.2. There was no evidence for sustained human-to-human transmission. Continued surveillance of influenza viruses at the swine-human interface is of major importance to enable early detection of new IAV subtypes and changes in the epidemiological situation. The authors consider the publication of data from the surveillance program to be essential in order to raise awareness of the disease among both veterinarians and the general public and to supplement existing information on circulating influenza viruses in Europe.

[PMID: 41185363] Effective air purification is crucial for controlling airborne contamination, especially in food storage environments where microbial cross-contamination can compromise food safety. Conventional filtration methods often suffer from microbial accumulation, leading to decreased efficiency and potential recontamination. This study aimed to develop a polyester-based nonwoven filter doped with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) synthesized using a green method involving banana peel extract. Two embedding methods, padding and in situ synthesis, were optimized for pH and temperature to enhance nanoparticle deposition and antimicrobial activity. The optimal conditions were determined to be pH 12 at 25 °C for in situ synthesis, achieving superior ZnO loading and photocatalytic activity under UVA irradiation. ZnO-doped filters were assembled into the UVLED module in a 512 L aerobiology chamber simulating refrigerator conditions, achieving more than 3-log reduction against aerosolized foodborne pathogens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes. Structural characterization using SEM and FT-IR confirmed uniform nanoparticle distribution and stable embedding within the polyester matrix. The developed ZnO-doped polyester filters provide robust and reusable air purification capabilities, highlighting their potential as sustainable and effective solutions for improving microbial safety in food preservation environments.

[PMID: 41185294] The bacterial contamination and failure of pasteurization are leading threats to the safety of dairy productions. Milk contains a large quantity of fat which supports bacterial growth but its influence on pasteurization efficacy and biofilm formation remains poorly understood. In this study, we first demonstrate that the inactivation of Salmonella during pasteurization is significantly less effective in whole milk compared to skim milk, with the D-value increasing from 0.60 min in skim milk to 0.67 min in whole milk (P = 0.0047). In whole milk, Salmonella biofilms form greater biomass and display a distinct architecture from biofilms in skim milk. Specifically, Salmonella in whole milk was embedded within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), while cells in skim milk biofilms were sparsely distributed. Raman spectroscopy showed that biofilms formed in whole milk possess a distinctly higher lipid content. Therefore, we hypothesized that the thermal tolerance of Salmonella in whole milk was directly linked to its physical interaction with milkfat. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed an increase from 26.1 % to 86.1 % of the fraction of Salmonella co-localizing with milkfat after 12 h of incubation in whole milk. Lipase treatment (200 units/mL) on whole milk reduced biofilm formation and improved the efficacy of thermal inactivation. Our findings demonstrate the milkfat acts as a physical scaffold, facilitating bacterial aggregation and the formation of a protective, lipid-rich biofilm matrix enhancing Salmonella survival during pasteurization. These insights should inform pasteurization strategies of high-fat dairy products to ensure food safety.

[PMID: 41184436] Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) causes approximately 155 000 deaths annually and poses significant risks to both human and animal health. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in NTS is a growing global public health threat. Using a One Health approach, this study investigated NTS in swine, poultry, and wastewater in Gauteng Province, South Africa. From May 2019 to August 2020, 507 samples were collected, including animal faeces (n = 388), hand swabs (n = 104), abattoir and farm run-off (n = 10), and hospital (n = 1) and municipal wastewater (n = 4). Whole genome sequencing of recovered isolates revealed a 2.37% (12/507) NTS prevalence, identifying four serovars: Salmonella Enteritidis sequence type (ST) 11 (n = 3), S. Infantis ST32 (n = 4), S. Irumu ST2026 (n = 2), and multidrug-resistant S. Typhimurium monophasic variant 1,4,[5],12:i:- ST34 (n = 3). The ST34 strains, detected in swine, exhibited ASSuT (ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline) resistance pattern and marked the first detection of ST34 from an animal source in Africa. The strains harboured a novel sopE-phage (AmTI) and SGI-4. Phylogenetic analysis linked these strains to human cases in South Africa and the UK, which could indicate transmission of MDR S. Typhimurium between animals and humans, underscoring the importance of enhanced AMR surveillance using a One Health approach.

[PMID: 41183489] Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium is a leading cause of foodborne outbreaks linked to chickens in the United States. To investigate the genomic landscape of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in this population, 1 048 chicken-associated S. Typhimurium genomes collected nationwide were analyzed. Overall, 84.5% of isolates carried at least one AMR determinant, and 34.3% displayed multidrug resistance (MDR). Sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance were most prevalent (1.03 and 1.01 AMR determinant per isolate, respectively). ARG co-occurrence analysis identified strong associations among tet(A), sul1, sul2, aac(3)-VIa, and aadA1, with blaCMY-2 emerging within an expanding co-resistance cluster. ARG-plasmid replicon association analysis indicated significant positive links between sul2 and tet(A) with IncC and ColRNAI. Machine learning-driven association rule mining demonstrated that integron carriage perfectly predicted MDR, and their absence in both non-AMR and AMR but non-MDR isolates underscores their pivotal role as the defining marker of MDR. We observed a pan-genome pattern with 3 855 core and 9 549 accessory genes, reflecting both genomic conservation and diversity. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis revealed two major clades, with sequence type 19 comprising 99.0% of the isolates. This research provides a comprehensive genomic characterization of chicken-associated S. Typhimurium in the United States, highlighting key AMR mechanisms relevant for food safety and public health.

[PMID: 41183066] The bactericidal lectin RegIIIβ secreted by intestinal epithelial cells, kills the microbiota and enteropathogens but also been suggested to modulate bacterial physiology and host interactions. However, it remains to be determined whether RegIIIβ plays roles beyond its bactericidal effects. The present study revealed that RegIIIβ binds to the enteropathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in the gut, thereby increasing the locomotion speed of this bacterium through maintenance of the membrane potential. This led to enhanced invasion by S. Typhimurium into epithelial cells. Finally, RegIIIβ facilitated the gut colonization levels of S. Typhimurium and enteropathy in the early stages of gastrointestinal infection. In conclusion, S. Typhimurium has become tolerant to RegIIIβ in the evolutionary process, during which the pathogen has simultaneously acquired the ability to exploit this antimicrobial to enhance flagellar-based locomotion for successful gastrointestinal infection. Our findings provide novel insight into the roles of RegIIIβ in gastrointestinal infection caused by S. Typhimurium.",10

Intravenous infusion of all drugs was started at the beginning of the operation and continued for 60 minutes. At the end of infusion period the depth of fluorescein dye penetration in the skin flap was assessed visually from photographic records, and the flap survival area was measured by the grid method at the seventh postoperative day. There was a significant reduction in distal necrosis of random skin flaps after intravenous infusion of L-arginine, iloprost, and L-arginine combined with iloprost (p < 0.01). Possible mechanisms that may be responsible for impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and vasospasm in the microvasculature of random skin flap and their prevention with L-arginine and iloprost include restoration of the depleted stores of NO which in turn causes vasodilatation and has an antithrombotic effect.

[PMID: 2153470] The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms associated with the reciprocal relation between magnesium and calcium on vascular smooth muscle tone in bovine pulmonary artery and vein. Rapid removal of magnesium from Krebs-bicarbonate medium used to bathe isolated rings of precontracted artery or vein caused transient endothelium- and calcium-dependent relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation. Both responses were antagonized by oxyhemoglobin, methylene blue, or superoxide anion and were enhanced by superoxide dismutase. The transient relaxation was followed by sustained endothelium-independent contraction. Endothelium-denuded vascular rings contracted in response to extracellular magnesium depletion without alteration in cyclic GMP levels. The data suggest that vascular endothelium-derived nitric oxide is responsible for the calcium-dependent relaxation elicited by extracellular magnesium depletion. Indeed, in bioassay cascade studies, magnesium removal from the medium used to perfuse intact artery or vein enhanced the formation and/or release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor by calcium-dependent mechanisms. In the absence of both extracellular magnesium and calcium, calcium readdition caused transient endothelium-dependent relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation, and both responses were abolished by oxyhemoglobin or methylene blue. In the presence of magnesium, however, readdition of calcium to calcium-depleted medium caused only contractile responses. Addition of magnesium to calcium-containing medium consistently caused endothelium- and cyclic GMP-independent relaxation that was not altered by oxyhemoglobin or methylene blue. Thus, magnesium and calcium elicit reciprocal or mutually antagonistic effects at the levels of both endothelium-derived relaxing factor formation and/or release and smooth muscle contraction. This relation may be of physiological importance, and the possibility that a reduction in circulating magnesium levels could lead to calcium-mediated vasospasm may be of pathophysiological concern.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187380] Mutations of the Ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene are generally associated with syndromic tooth agenesis, yet their influence on non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) has not been thoroughly elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of NSTA and to identify pathogenic EDA mutations in two Chinese families using whole-exome sequencing, and explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Two unrelated individuals with NSTA and their families were enrolled in this study, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Whole-exome sequencing was performed, followed by variants detection and filtering to identify pathogenic genes and mutations. The identified genetic mutations were further validated by Sanger sequencing and confirmed to be absent in 300 unrelated healthy individuals. Conservation analysis, three-dimensional (3D) modeling, and electrostatic potential calculations were conducted accordingly. We identified a novel mutation c.827 G>T (p.Arg276Leu) and a previously reported mutation c.1069 C>T (p.Arg357Trp) in the EDA gene, with the latter showing previously unreported phenotypic characteristics. Both mutations are located in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) domain of EDA, which is crucial for binding with ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR). Conservation analysis indicated that these mutations are evolutionarily conserved across various species. In silico predictions and 3D modeling analyses suggested that these mutations may be pathogenic, potentially due to alterations in the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic potential, thereby affecting EDA-EDAR interaction. Our findings broaden the mutation spectrum of EDA gene associated with NSTA by identifying a novel mutation and provide a basis for future genetic counseling.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187377] Foodborne contaminants, such as mycotoxins and microplastics, pose significant threats to human health due to their high toxicity and persistence in the food chain, thus necessitate effective mitigation strategies. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), characterized by high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, safety, and environmental friendliness, offer a promising solution for adsorbing these pollutants. This review systematically explores the roles, binding locations, interaction forces, and molecular mechanisms underlying LAB-contaminant interactions, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetic properties of the adsorption processes. Notably, LAB strains with outstanding adsorption capabilities are spotlighted, along with innovative enhancement strategies: optimized culture conditions, co-culture systems, nanoparticle functionalization, immobilized cells, and combinations with bio-adsorbents. The review further demonstrates the applications of LAB in ensuring safe food production and maintaining biological health. Future directions include multi-omics-driven gene discovery, genetic engineering techniques for precision regulation, and machine learning for adsorption optimization, advancing mechanistic insights and interdisciplinary solution.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187370] An improved route to the indolequinone pharmacophore is described based on the reaction of bromobenzoquinones with enamines. Through the implementation of small changes in the reaction conditions, the reaction conditions were much improved with quantities of copper salt, base, and acetonitrile solvent all reduced compared with the original method. The resulting indolequinone-3-carboxylates were subsequently converted into novel indolequinones as potential inhibitors of the quinone reductase enzyme NQO2. A number of potent, mechanism-based inhibitors were identified, increasing our understanding of structure-activity relationships for inhibition of this enzyme.

[PMID: 41187366] The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, primarily through mechanisms involving carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Aberrant FGFR1 signalling has been implicated in various cancers, including lung, breast, neck and urothelial carcinoma. Despite the recognized oncogenic potential of FGFR1, therapeutic strategies targeting its kinase domain remain inadequately explored. This underscores an urgent need for the development of novel FGFR1 inhibitors, particularly through de novo drug design approaches, to effectively counteract FGFR1-driven malignancies. This research aims to develop novel FGFR1 inhibitors through a multi-step approach involving fragment-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and density functional theory studies (DFT), with the goal of targeting FGFR1's kinase binding domain to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Initially, known FGFR inhibitor molecules were retrieved and subjected to fragment-based drug designing and virtual screening. Through thorough analysis, molecules containing the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold were identified as promising candidates. A pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based database containing 90,952 molecules was subsequently retrieved from PubChem and filtered using molecular docking-based virtual screening resulting 94 molecules having better binding affinity than derazantinib, reference drug. After pharmacokinetic profiling (ADME), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) studies, out of 94 molecules only 11 compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and superior MM-GBSA binding free energies were selected. Docking-based screening revealed that selected 11 compounds demonstrated better binding scores than the reference drug, derazantinib. Among them, HIT1, was selected for 150ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess its conformational stability. DFT calculations further confirmed its bio-feasibility by analyzing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Overall, the selected lead compounds exhibited enhanced binding affinity, superior conformational stability, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to derazantinib. Present findings suggest that the identified hit molecules hold strong potential for inhibiting FGFR1's kinase domain and disrupting FGFR-associated tumor angiogenesis.

[PMID: 41187361] To explore the mechanism of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa on the accumulation of γ-glutamyl peptides and taste development in Jinhua ham, the influences of R. mucilaginosa on fungal community structure, functional enzyme gene expression, key enzyme activities, γ-glutamyl peptides accumulation and taste attributes were investigated during the dry-ripening. In comparison with Pichia kudriavzevii XS-5 (PK), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa XZY63-3 (RX) and no inoculation (CK), the inoculation with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa EIODSF019 (RE) showed the highest overall acceptance and richness. Metagenomics revealed that RE inoculation inhibited Aspergillus abundance, and the profile of Rhodotorula reached 45.94 % at genus level. The treatment of RE increased the gene abundance of amino acid metabolism pathways; the expression levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase gene in RE were increased by 83.27 % compared with CK, and the activities of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase increased from 214 U/g proteins of CK to 567 U/g proteins of RE. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the total contents of γ-glutamyl peptides increased from 136.40 μg/g of CK to 518.18 μg/g of RE. Partial least squares regression and correlation analysis indicated that γ-Glu-Cys and γ-Glu-Gln were mainly responsible for the improvement of overall acceptance and richness of Jinhua ham with RE inoculation.",10

Moreover, patients often report their aftercare needs are unmet. In an era of increasing pressure on healthcare resources - alongside a growing emphasis on patient-empowerment and appropriate care - it is time to reconsider current follow-up practices for gynaecological cancer survivors. This has led to a growing body of research exploring new approaches to follow-up care in gynaecologic oncology. In this scoping review, we aim to explore these alternative follow-up approaches and evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to current follow-up care. The methodological framework for scoping studies by Arksey and O'Malley's was used, further guided by the PRISMA-ScR checklist. A literature search on follow-up care for gynaecological cancers was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid) and Cochrane Library. Included studies employed a comparative method, allowing assessment of alternative approaches relative to current follow-up. Data were charted according to the TIDieR checklist and guide for better reporting of interventions. Eighteen articles were included, identifying three categories of alternative follow-up strategies: nurse-led follow-up, reduced follow-up and patient-initiated follow-up. Across all categories, these approaches showed similar - and sometimes improved - effect on oncological outcomes, quality of life, and/or patient satisfaction, without increased costs and healthcare use. Follow-up care can be delivered in alternative ways, without compromising on patient experiences or oncological safety. This offers the possibility of more cost-effective and resource-efficient healthcare. These findings support the feasibility of using alternative follow-up strategies in gynaecological oncological care.

[PMID: 41187375] To compare cost-effectiveness of targeted therapeutic strategies for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHB) patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage endometrial cancer. A Markov-based cost-utility model using a third-party payer perspective compared concurrent and maintenance treatment strategies incorporating dostarlimab and trastuzumab for newly diagnosed stage III-IV endometrial cancer: chemotherapy alone; 3 universal immunotherapy strategies (universal concurrent and maintenance dostarlimab +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu-positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas); and 3 targeted immunotherapy strategies (dostarlimab for mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas). Costs (2024 USD), utilities, and clinical estimates were derived from published literature and the National Cancer Database. The base case analysis was a microsimulation with 10,000 runs, accompanied by a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 20,000 trials. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We performed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses on key parameters and analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. All targeted immunotherapy strategies were cost-effective compared to chemotherapy alone in both NHB and NHW, while universal immunotherapy was never cost-effective. Targeted strategies were more cost-effective in NHB than NHW. Targeted dostarlimab for dMMR plus trastuzumab for HER2 serous and carcinosarcomas was the most cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy, with an ICER of $119,945/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, assuming longer durations of treatment benefit resulted in lower ICERs. Personalized treatment strategies incorporating HER2 and MMR testing should be considered to optimize both cost-effectiveness and equity in care.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187216] Many taxa have independently evolved genetic sex determination where a single gene located on a sex chromosome controls gonadal differentiation. The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex-reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the ""Four Core Genotypes"" model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.

[PMID: 41187208] This study reports the first green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using an aqueous leaf extract of Brownlowia tersa (B. tersa), confirming their formation via UV-Vis spectrophotometry with a peak at 472 nm. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial and neuroprotective activities, particularly for Alzheimer's disease. GC-MS and FT-IR analyses identified phenolics and flavonoids as the capping and reducing agents in the synthesis process. FESEM imaging showed nanoparticles of varied shapes and sizes, while EDX analysis confirmed the presence of silver, oxygen, and carbon. The antimicrobial activity was demonstrated with inhibition zones ranging from 8.5 to 10.5 mm against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 100 and 200 μg/disc, compared to control, deionised water. In antioxidant assays, AgNPs exhibited an IC₅₀ of 1533.448 μg/ml, significantly higher than L-ascorbic acid (IC₅₀: 83.948 μg/ml) and the plant extract (IC₅₀: 254.438 μg/ml), indicating weaker antioxidant properties of AgNPs. The cytotoxicity of the AgNPs was assessed using the brine shrimp lethality test, yielding LC₅₀ value of 13.50 μg/ml, indicating moderate toxicity. Neuropharmacological tests, except the elevated plus maze, on swiss albino mice revealed significant anxiolytic effects (p < 0.05) and enhanced locomotor activity. Molecular docking studies of bioactive compounds from B. tersa leaves with Alzheimer's and bacterial infection-related proteins revealed binding energies from -7.7 to -5.2 kcal/mol, with Benzamide, N-ethyl-N-[(4-ethylaminophenyl) sulfonyl]- and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol showing the strongest affinities. While the results are promising, the study acknowledges challenges in scaling up the synthesis process and emphasises the need for further research into the long-term biological effects and safety of AgNPs. Overall, B. tersa-derived AgNPs show great potential for therapeutic applications in bacterial infections and neurological disorders, but scalability and safety require more investigation.

[PMID: 41187206] Fast skeletal muscle fibers from zebrafish share a number of functional properties with mammalian twitch muscle fibers, making this vertebrate a precious model to investigate the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders. We previously reported that action potentials (APs) from zebrafish fast fibers exhibit low amplitude and require unusually strong negative resting membrane voltage levels to be elicited. In this study, using voltage-clamp and current-clamp techniques, we explored the properties of voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV) responsible for initiation and propagation of AP in isolated adult zebrafish fast skeletal muscle fibers and compared them to mouse fast-twitch muscle fibers using the same experimental conditions. We found that kinetics of activation and inactivation of NaV were faster in zebrafish fibers and, overall, that the voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted by 25 mV toward negative voltages as compared to mouse fibers, yielding a mean half-inactivation potential of -90 mV. In agreement with these findings, recording of APs at various resting membrane potentials indicated that APs vanished for resting membrane potentials less negative than -80 mV in zebrafish, whereas APs could still be elicited from resting membrane potentials as low as -60 mV in mice. In addition, Ca2+ transients induced by field stimulation were insensitive to Na+ current blockade in zebrafish but not in mouse fibers. Fluorescence labeling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors showed that zebrafish fast fibers were multi-innervated with a mean distance between extra-synaptic sarcolemma and motor endplates of 14 µm, expected to lead to negligible attenuation of depolarization propagated from endplates. Finally, knock out of the two genes encoding pore-forming NaV subunits in zebrafish muscles did not induce any change in locomotion and escape behavior of the animals. Taken together, these data question the role of NaV and the occurrence of APs in zebrafish fast muscle.",10

In this prospective interventional case series, patients with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction who were candidates for En-DCR were enrolled. Patients with a known history of previous DCR, sinus surgery, rhinoplasty, nasal trauma, nasal anomaly, canalicular or punctal occlusion, or less than one year of follow-up were excluded. All patients underwent En-DCR and stenting followed by ostial packing using Gelfoam soaked with dexamethasone. The patients were assessed preoperatively, on the first postoperative day, after 2 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year. Postoperative outcomes were anatomical and functional success, defined as patent irrigation test and resolution of epiphora, respectively. The nasolacrimal drainage system was evaluated anatomically and functionally during the follow-up period. Eighty-three patients with a mean age of 54.36±15.27 years were enrolled. Of these, 61 patients (73.5%) were women. The mean duration of follow-up was 20.7±6.9 months. Anatomical success was achieved in all patients and remained stable during the study duration and at 1 year. Functional failure leading to epiphora was observed in 1 patient 3 months after surgery and resolved after re-DCR at year 1. Preoperative tenderness and purulent reflux were observed in 12%, 33.7% of which completely resolved postoperatively. Moderate and severe hemorrhage was observed in 12 (14.5%) and 2 (2.4%) patients, respectively. En-DCR without mucosal flap preservation in combination with silicone stent and steroid-soaked Gelfoam is a safe and highly successful procedure in patients with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

[PMID: 34794198] The optimal regimes of tranexamic acid (TXA) and dexamethasone (DXM) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are still uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a prolonged course of intravenous TXA and DXM involving a high initial dose in TKA. Patients who underwent primary TKA at our center were randomized to receive one of four regimes: control (group A), prolonged course of TXA (B), prolonged course of DXM (C), or the combination of a prolonged course of TXA and DXM (D). The four groups were compared in primary outcomes (fibrinolytic and inflammatory markers, knee function, postoperative pain levels, and consumption of opioids) and secondary outcomes (blood loss, maximal drop in hemoglobin, coagulation, fasting blood glucose, and complications). A total of 162 patients were enrolled. On postoperative days 2 and 3, fibrinolytic markers were lower in groups B and D than in groups A and C; inflammatory markers were lower in groups C and D than in groups A and B. Inflammatory markers were lower in group B than in group A on postoperative day 3. Postoperative pain levels and oxycodone consumption were lower, and knee function was better in groups C and D. The four groups did not differ in any of the secondary outcomes. A prolonged course of intravenous TXA and DXM involving high initial doses can effectively inhibit postoperative fibrinolytic and inflammatory responses, reduce pain, and improve knee function after TKA.

[PMID: 25680452] Rapid recovery after total joint arthroplasty requires patients to get ahead and stay ahead or the four impediments to early rehabilitation and discharge: volume depletion, blood loss, pain, and nausea. Adequate volume resuscitation starts before entering the operating room and focuses on intravenous fluids rather than red blood cell transfusion. Tranexamic acid limits blood loss and reduces the need for most other blood management systems. Rapid recovery pain management focuses on minimizing parenteral opioids. A short-acting spinal with a peri-articular local anesthetic injection is reliable, reproducible, and safe. Patients at risk for post-operative nausea are treated with anti-emetic medications and perioperative dexamethasone. These interventions reflect a transition from the sick-patient model to the well-patient model and make rapid recovery joint arthroplasty a reality in 2015.

[PMID: 23021035] The use of topical hemostatic agents is widespread and has been shown to reduce bleeding during a wide variety of surgical procedures. Nonetheless, as biologically active agents, there is potential for allergic reactions to these products. This is a report of intraoperative anaphylaxis to gelatin associated with the use of two topical hemostatic agents. Case report. There is no outside funding or potential conflict of interest. A patient with anaphylaxis during anterior spinal fusion. Laboratory assays for tryptase, gelatin-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), and total IgE. A 14-year-old male with myelomeningocele and scoliosis was treated with anterior spinal fusion from T12 to L3. Gelfoam sponges were applied during the preparation of the disc spaces. Approximately 1 hour later, Floseal hemostatic matrix was applied to a briskly bleeding screw hole in the L3 vertebral body, and the patient experienced an abrupt onset of hypotension and ventilatory difficulty. Epinephrine, dexamethasone, and blood products were administered for hemodynamic support while the surgical site was closed. Removal of the drapes revealed a widespread erythematous rash, and the patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit. When stable 3 days later, he returned to the operating room for completion of the spinal fusion. Postoperative laboratory assays were sent that revealed elevated levels of tryptase, total IgE, porcine, and bovine gelatin-specific IgE. The patient was counseled to avoid gelatin-containing products. At 6-month follow-up, his instrumented spine was radiographically fused and he reported no further allergic issues. Anaphylaxis may occur because of animal gelatin components of topical hemostatic agents. Previous reports have focused on the thrombin components. Care should be taken in the administration of these products, particularly in the atopic individual.

[PMID: 17338651] Multiple myeloma, as with other malignancies, has been associated with the development of venous thromboembolic events. Chemotherapy or steroids in combination with antiangiogenic agents can further enhance this risk. The identification of measurable factors associated with this prothrombotic state could help in the selection of patients who need antithrombotic prophylaxis. Malignancy-associated thrombophilic state, paraprotein-specific mechanisms and treatment-induced changes can explain the high rate of thrombosis in this cancer population. While the release of inflammatory cytokines induces high levels of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor and downregulate the protein C system, elevated plasma immunoglobulin can impair fibrinolysis. Strategies of thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, warfarin or aspirin in patients treated with thalidomide/chemotherapy or lenalidomide and dexamethasone have shown efficacy. Early data indicate that the effect of low molecular weight heparin on multiple myeloma is not confined to the anticoagulant effect but could extend to survival; a similar positive trend in overall survival has also been reported in patients treated with aspirin.

[PMID: 41187385] First-generation Latinx immigrant youth face risks for experiencing unique immigration-related traumas, which could exacerbate their mental health. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of forced immigration-related family separation on the association between traditional adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) among Latinx immigrant youth from the Northern Triangle (NT; El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Primary surveys assessing forced immigration-related family separation, ACEs, and mental health were administered to a sample of NT immigrant youth (N = 172). Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the study aim. In main effects analysis, forced immigration-related family separation was significantly associated with depression (B = 2.11, CI = [0.11, 4.11], p = .039) and PTSD (B = 4.01, CI = [0.63, 7.40], p = .021) symptoms. ACEs were significantly associated with depression (B = 1.34, CI = [0.86, 1.81], p < .001), anxiety (B = 1.05, CI = [0.63, 1.47], p < .001), and PTSD (B = 2.17, CI = [1.37, 2.97], p < .001) symptoms. In moderation effects analysis, the association of ACEs on depression (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.18, -0.25], p = .014), anxiety (B = -1.00, CI = [-1.86, -0.13], p = .024), and PTSD (B = -2.23, CI = [-3.84, -0.62], p = .007) symptoms was significantly attenuated among youth who experienced forced immigration-related family separation. Study findings may underscore the need to consider the inclusivity of immigration-related trauma in ACE assessment tools.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187354] In recent years, atmospheric pollution has been increasing day by day due to the rapid growth of industrialization, urbanization and motor vehicles. As a result, a large number of pollutants containing harmful and toxic gases like NO2, NH3, H2, H2S and C3H6O etc. are being released into the environment. This detrimental increase can cause adverse effects on human life, necessitating monitoring and safety measures. Gas sensors play a crucial role in this regard by monitoring and alerting when pollutant levels exceed permissible limits. Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors have gained much popularity due to their good stability, tunable chemical properties, simple fabrication process and cost effectiveness. SnO2 is the most widely used MOS material for detecting various toxic and hazardous gases, owing to its excellent physical and chemical properties, high reliability and short adsorption and desorption times. In this review, we elevated the role of SnO2 in detecting various toxic and hazardous gases and highlighting different synthesis methods with various structural and morphological modifications are summarized. By reviewing the latest advancements, this paper proposes several future research directions for SnO2-based gas sensors.",10
Diabetes remission occurs less in people treated with conventional therapy than in people treated with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery.,diabetes remission AND laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding AND conventional therapy AND comparative study,"18212316,16249543,41187323,41187294,41187260,41187242,41187196,41187181,41187140,41187097","[PMID: 18212316] Observational studies suggest that surgically induced loss of weight may be effective therapy for type 2 diabetes. To determine if surgically induced weight loss results in better glycemic control and less need for diabetes medications than conventional approaches to weight loss and diabetes control. Unblinded randomized controlled trial conducted from December 2002 through December 2006 at the University Obesity Research Center in Australia, with general community recruitment to established treatment programs. Participants were 60 obese patients (BMI >30 and <40) with recently diagnosed (<2 years) type 2 diabetes. Conventional diabetes therapy with a focus on weight loss by lifestyle change vs laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with conventional diabetes care. Remission of type 2 diabetes (fasting glucose level <126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L] and glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] value <6.2% while taking no glycemic therapy). Secondary measures included weight and components of the metabolic syndrome. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Of the 60 patients enrolled, 55 (92%) completed the 2-year follow-up. Remission of type 2 diabetes was achieved by 22 (73%) in the surgical group and 4 (13%) in the conventional-therapy group. Relative risk of remission for the surgical group was 5.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-14.0). Surgical and conventional-therapy groups lost a mean (SD) of 20.7% (8.6%) and 1.7% (5.2%) of weight, respectively, at 2 years (P < .001). Remission of type 2 diabetes was related to weight loss (R2 = 0.46, P < .001) and lower baseline HbA1c levels (combined R2 = 0.52, P < .001). There were no serious complications in either group. Participants randomized to surgical therapy were more likely to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes through greater weight loss. These results need to be confirmed in a larger, more diverse population and have long-term efficacy assessed. actr.org Identifier: ACTRN012605000159651.

[PMID: 16249543] Lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes in obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and conventional diet (No-LAGB) in the prevention (primary intervention study; 56 vs. 29 patients) and remission (secondary intervention study; 17 vs. 20 patients) of type 2 diabetes and hypertension in grade 3 obesity in a 4-year study. The subjects (n = 122; age 48.5 +/- 1.05 years; BMI 45.7 +/- 0.67 kg/m2) underwent a diagnostic workup, including psychological and psychiatric assessments, in preparation for the LAGB procedure. Of the 122 subjects, 73 had the surgery (LAGB group). The control group (No-LAGB group) consisted of the 49 subjects who refused the surgery but agreed to be followed up; 6 of these subjects dropped out by the 2nd year of the study, so that the final number of patients was 73 and 43 in the LAGB and No-LAGB groups, respectively. All patients had a yearly visit and oral glucose tolerance test. From baseline to the end of the 4-year follow-up, BMI decreased from 45.9 +/- 0.89 at baseline to 37.7 +/- 0.71 kg/m2 in the LAGB group and remained steady in the No-LAGB group (from 45.2 +/- 1.04 to 46.5 +/- 1.37 kg/m2), with no significant differences between the primary and secondary intervention groups. In the primary intervention study, five of the No-LAGB subjects (17.2%) and none of the LAGB subjects (0.0%; P = 0.0001) progressed to type 2 diabetes; in the secondary intervention study, type 2 diabetes remitted in one No-LAGB patient (4.0%) and seven LAGB patients (45.0%; P = 0.0052). Hypertension occurred in 11 No-LAGB patients (25.6%) and 1 LAGB patient (1.4%; P = 0.0001) and remitted in 1 No-LAGB (2.3%) and 15 LAGB patients (20.5%; P = 0.0001). A study of body mass composition revealed a significant reduction of fat mass and a transitory, but not significant, decrease of fat-free mass in LAGB patients. In morbid obesity, sustained and long-lasting weight loss obtained through LAGB prevents the occurrence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and decreases the prevalence of these disorders.

[PMID: 41187323] To determine the 1-year mortality in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement and its relationship with the myocardial damage extension scale. An observational, retrospective, cross-sectional, and comparative study was conducted. Patients over 18 years of age, of both sexes, who underwent aortic valve replacement between March 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021, were included. Patients were classified into subgroups based on the myocardial damage extension classification to determine 12-month mortality. In addition, risk factors associated with mortality, as well as clinical and sociodemographic variables, were documented. A total of 177 patients (104 men [59%] and 73 women [41%]) were included. Distribution among myocardial damage stages was: Stage 0 (5%), stage 1 (25%), stage 2 (56%), stage 3 (8%), and stage 4 (6%). One-year mortality was 6% (11/177), predominantly in stage 2 (72%) and stage 3 (18%). Hypertension (64%) and diabetes mellitus (55%) were the most frequent comorbidities among the deceased. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score > 2% were risk factors associated with mortality. One-year mortality was 6%, predominantly in stage 2 of myocardial damage extension. The staging did not correlate with mortality after 1 year of follow-up. An STS score > 2% and LVEF < 30% are risk factors for mortality.

[PMID: 41187294] The optimal surgical approach for intraarticular calcaneal fractures remains debated. This study compares deep infection rates between the extended lateral (EL) and sinus tarsi (ST) approaches. A retrospective review was conducted of 782 patients treated surgically for OTA 82B/C calcaneal fractures across 15 institutions. Deep infection was defined as requiring surgical débridement or treatment for osteomyelitis. Risk factors were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses. Of 782 fractures, 444 were treated with EL and 338 with ST. Deep infections occurred in 6.8% of EL and 3.0% of ST cases (P = 0.017). Multivariate analysis found that surgical approach (P = 0.03) and age (P < 0.001) were independent risk factors. EL had more wound complications; ST had more symptomatic implants. The ST approach was associated with lower rates of deep infection and wound complications, even in higher-risk patients.

[PMID: 41187260] The venipuncture is one of the most frequently performed procedures in health care. Arm phantoms are available for training, because the procedure itself can be challenging. These phantom arms do not represent a realistic setting and do not offer opportunities to train challenging scenarios. This randomized, single-blind study aimed to train health care workers on both a commercially available injection arm and an in-house developed 3D-printed arm, to evaluate the perceived realism and adequacy of training on both arms. Participants were trained on both the commercially available arm (arm A) and the 3D-printed arm (arm B). Participants were randomized and blinded from knowing which arm they started training on. A questionnaire was filled in on, among others, the perceived realism of the arm (0 for not realistic, 100 for realistic) and adequacy of the training (inadequate, moderate, or adequate). A total of 68 participants evaluated the perceived realism of arm A and B, which were scored on average 62.97 (SD 21.47) and 63.79 (SD 17.45), respectively. The difference in perceived realism of the two arms was not statistically significant (based on the paired t test, mean difference=-0.82, P=.78). Training on arm A was reported inadequate by 7% (5/68 participants), moderately adequate by 31% (21/68), and adequate by 62% (42/68). This was not significantly different from arm B (marginal homogeneity test, P=.74), with 4% (3/68), 38% (26/68), and 57% (39/68), respectively, reporting that the training was inadequate, moderately adequate, and adequate. The 3D-printed arm is as realistic and provides an equally adequate training compared to the commercially available arm. The 3D-printed arm offers the additional possibility to design different models representing several levels of difficulty for vascular morphology. This potentially lowers the number of venipuncture failures by preparing health care workers on challenging scenarios.

[PMID: 41187242] Roflumilast is a topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor FDA-approved for treating plaque psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) is a novel non-invasive imaging method utilized to evaluate skin in vivo. This study uses LC-OCT (Damae Medical, France) to visualize the effects of 0.3% roflumilast versus vehicle on healthy skin in vivo. Three subjects (mean age: 26 years) with healthy skin applied roflumilast (right forearm) and vehicle (left forearm) daily for seven days. LC-OCT imaging was performed at multiple intervals: before cream application (T0A), after application (T0B), 15 minutes (T0C), 1 hour (T0D), 8-12 hours (T0E), 24 hours (T0F), 7 days (T7), and 7 days after the last application (T14). A dermatopathologist evaluated changes in morphology, and an AI algorithm calculated the changes in stratum corneum (SC) and epidermal thickness. At T0B, both creams showed a hyperreflective layer above the SC, which diminished over time. Roflumilast-treated skin exhibited increased dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) demarcation, more organized keratinocytes, and a reduction in hyperreflective material. The algorithm showed increased SC thickness in both arms until T7, but only roflumilast's SC thickness continued increasing until T14, while the vehicle-treated arm decreased. Epidermal thickness increased in both arms but reversed at T14. LC-OCT visualized roflumilast's effects on healthy skin, including reduced hyperreflective material consistent with mottled pigmentation and normalized keratinocyte organization, suggesting the effects it has on healthy skin. The AI algorithm showed lasting effects on SC thickness, even after discontinuation of treatment.

[PMID: 41187196] The safety of single-port totally extraperitoneal (STEP) inguinal hernia repair compared to conventional totally extraperitoneal (CTEP) has been supported by various randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, the optimal method remains unclear because of variations in the location and length of the incision as well as different uses of the single-port device. We standardized STEP using the glove method with a straight umbilical incision that maintained the wound profile within the confines of the umbilicus for better cosmetic satisfaction and port operative pain reduction. The incision length was limited to 1-1.5 cm, extending no further than the umbilicus. The STEP is performed utilizing the glove method using Alexis of XXS size. To minimize forceps interference, the surgeon dissected the spermatic cord into two distinct phases. As the mesh was inserted within the pneumoperitoneum, it was deployed safely and securely. In addition, we present the surgical outcomes at our institution for an early career surgeon. A total of 25 unilateral inguinal hernia STEP procedures were performed between April and October 2023. The median operative time was 68 minutes, and the procedure was performed safely with no complications requiring treatment. In conclusion, STEP using the glove method with a total intraumbilical incision can be safely performed by an early career surgeon.

[PMID: 41187181] Parrot fever, caused by Chlamydia psittaci, is a zoonotic disease typically treated with tetracyclines. Omadacycline, a novel aminomethyl tetracycline, has limited reports on its efficacy in severe Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia in the literature. We present a case of a patient with severe Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia showing symptoms of chills, high fever, shock, hepatic and renal insufficiency, and acute respiratory failure with copious yellow watery sputum. Chlamydia psittaci was confirmed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Despite initial treatment with moxifloxacin and doxycycline, the patient did not improve and was subsequently discharged after receiving omadacycline. Our findings highlight the potential of mNGS for rapid diagnosis of Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia and suggest omadacycline as a potential therapeutic option for severe cases that do not respond to conventional treatment.

[PMID: 41187140] The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has been significant and far-reaching. This paper retrospectively examines its effects on changes in the physical fitness of university students. From 2018 to 2020, a comprehensive undergraduate institution in southern Anhui Province was selected to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical health indicators among college students. The overall physical fitness of students at Chizhou University was clustered near the passing threshold of 80.8%, with 13.0% of students failing to meet the standard. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to an increased prevalence of overweight (11.3%) and obesity (4.4%) among the student population. In endurance running, both male and female students displayed a similar trend-initial improvement followed by a decline-resulting in reduced performance times by 16.7 s for males and 13.2 s for females in 2020. Notably, vital capacity and upper limb strength showed consistent upward trends from 2018 to 2020 for both genders. Specifically, male students' vital capacity increased by 2.0% and 3.4%, and upper limb strength by 4.8% and 8.3%, in consecutive years. Similarly, female students' vital capacity rose by 1.3% and 4.4%, while their upper limb strength improved by 3.9% and 3.5%, respectively. The short-term impact of the COVID-19 epidemic significant effected college students' endurance running performance. Future efforts should focus on the important long-term lagging effects of the pandemic. Meanwhile, there is an urgent need to better understand and develop alternative exercise modalities during major public health events to ensure the maintenance of physical fitness and overall health.

[PMID: 41187097] To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline. Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities. This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.",10
Differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells is skewed when insulin signaling is suppressed.,Insulin signaling AND Progenitor cell differentiation AND Myeloid cell AND Suppression effects,"41078332,31889368,30013477,26951333,22474082,41187382,41187335,41187270,41187268,41187220","[PMID: 41078332] Recent advancements in therapeutics have extended lifespan and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients, particularly with severe phenotypes. However, most patients fail to achieve normal motor function. Although structural bone defects and increased fracture susceptibility have been reported in both SMA patients and mouse models, the role of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein in bone homeostasis and therapeutic targets remains incompletely understood. To investigate the function of SMN in bone metabolism, a mild SMA mouse model and Smn1 conditional knockout mice in the myeloid lineage and mature osteoclasts were utilized. Bone architecture was assessed using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histological staining, and immunohistochemistry. RNA sequencing was performed to explore molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal defects. Primary bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were differentiated into osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively, and co-cultured to evaluate SMN-dependent regulation of osteoblast-osteoclast interactions. The therapeutic potential of exogenous osteoprotegerin (OPG) administration was further assessed. SMA mice exhibited significant bone mass reduction, characterized by impaired osteogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis. However, in vitro experiments revealed suppressed osteoclast differentiation in BMMs from SMA mice, which was inconsistent with in vivo findings. Co-culture studies demonstrated that osteoclast hyperactivity in SMA mice resulted from decreased osteoblast-derived OPG, induced by local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) deficiency. Mechanistically, SMN depletion led to IGF1 downregulation, thereby suppressing PI3K-Akt signaling, reducing OPG expression, and ultimately disrupting osteoblast-osteoclast coupling. Administration of exogenous OPG effectively mitigated osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity, indirectly promoting osteoblast function and partially restoring bone formation. These findings reveal that SMN protein loss caused IGF1 deficiency that inhibited the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, leading to downregulation of OPG expression and disrupted osteoblast-osteoclast coupling. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting OPG in SMA to alleviate skeletal complications and improve patient outcomes.

[PMID: 31889368] Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) is a low-affinity insulin growth factor (IGF) binder that may play an important role in bone metabolism. We previously reported that IGFBP7 enhanced osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) via the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. In this study, we tried to reveal its function in osteoclast differentiation and osteoporosis. We used both in vitro and in vivo studies to investigate the effects of IGFBP7 on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and osteoporosis, together with the underlying molecular mechanisms of these processes. We show that IGFBP7 inhibited receptor activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis, F-actin ring formation and bone resorption, which was confirmed by using recombinant IGFBP7 protein, lentivirus and siRNA. The NF-κB signalling pathway was inhibited during this process. Moreover, in a mouse ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis model, IGFBP7 treatment attenuated osteoporotic bone loss by inhibiting osteoclast activity. Taken together, these findings show that IGFBP7 suppressed osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo and suggest that IGFBP7 is a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis and plays a protective role in osteoporosis. These novel insights into IGFBP7 may facilitate the development of potential treatment strategies for oestrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis and other osteoclast-related disorders.

[PMID: 30013477] Acute myeloid leukemia is an aggressive disease characterized by clonal proliferation and differentiation into immature hematopoietic cells of dysfunctional myeloid precursors. Accumulating evidence shows that CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup> leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for drug resistance, metastasis, and relapse of leukemia. In this study, we found that Nanog, a transcription factor in stem cells, is significantly overexpressed in CD34<sup>+</sup> populations from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and in LSCs from leukemia cell lines. Our data demonstrate that the knockdown of Nanog inhibited proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Moreover, Nanog silencing suppressed the leukemogenesis of LSCs in mice. In addition, we found that these functions of Nanog were regulated by the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway. Nanog overexpression rescued the colony formation ability of LSCs treated with picropodophyllin (PPP), an IGF1R inhibitor. By contrast, knockdown of Nanog abolished the effects of IGF2 on the colony formation ability of these LSCs. These findings suggest that the IGF2/IGF1R/Nanog signaling pathway plays a critical role in LSC proliferation.

[PMID: 26951333] Dietary restriction (DR) improves health, delays tissue aging, and elongates survival in flies and worms. However, studies on laboratory mice and nonhuman primates revealed ambiguous effects of DR on lifespan despite improvements in health parameters. In this study, we analyzed consequences of adult-onset DR (24 h to 1 yr) on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. DR ameliorated HSC aging phenotypes, such as the increase in number of HSCs and the skewing toward myeloid-biased HSCs during aging. Furthermore, DR increased HSC quiescence and improved the maintenance of the repopulation capacity of HSCs during aging. In contrast to these beneficial effects, DR strongly impaired HSC differentiation into lymphoid lineages and particularly inhibited the proliferation of lymphoid progenitors, resulting in decreased production of peripheral B lymphocytes and impaired immune function. The study shows that DR-dependent suppression of growth factors and interleukins mediates these divergent effects caused by DR. Supplementation of insulin-like growth factor 1 partially reverted the DR-induced quiescence of HSCs, whereas IL-6/IL-7 substitutions rescued the impairment of B lymphopoiesis exposed to DR. Together, these findings delineate positive and negative effects of long-term DR on HSC functionality involving distinct stress and growth signaling pathways.

[PMID: 22474082] Improved glucose and lipid metabolism is a unique side effect of imatinib therapy in some chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients. We recently reported that plasma levels of adiponectin, an important regulator of insulin sensitivity, are elevated following imatinib therapy in CML patients, which could account for these improved metabolic outcomes. Adiponectin is secreted exclusively from adipocytes, suggesting that imatinib modulates adiponectin levels directly, by transcriptional upregulation of adiponectin in pre-existing adipocytes, and/or indirectly, by stimulating adipogenesis. In this report, we have demonstrated that imatinib promotes adipogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which in turn secrete high-molecular-weight adiponectin. Conversely, imatinib does not stimulate adiponectin secretion from mature adipocytes. We hypothesise that inhibition of PDGFRα (PDGFRA) and PDGFRβ (PDGFRB) is the mechanism by which imatinib promotes adipogenesis. Supporting this, functional blocking antibodies to PDGFR promote adipogenesis and adiponectin secretion in MSC cultures. We have shown that imatinib is a potent inhibitor of PDGF-induced PI3 kinase activation and, using a PI3 kinase p110α-specific inhibitor (PIK-75), we have demonstrated that suppression of this pathway recapitulates the effects of imatinib on MSC differentiation. Furthermore, using mitogens that activate the PI3 kinase pathway, or MSCs expressing constitutively activated Akt, we have shown that activation of the PI3 kinase pathway negates the pro-adipogenic effects of imatinib. Taken together, our results suggest that imatinib increases plasma adiponectin levels by promoting adipogenesis through the suppression of PI3 kinase signalling downstream of PDGFR.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187335] DNA nanostructure-enabled functional constructs have shown potential to improve healthcare outcomes by offering advanced disease diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Translating this potential of DNA nanostructure-based constructs to real life applications relies on maintaining and enhancing the structural integrity and functions of the surface-anchored moieties. In this study, we explored the possibility of utilizing choline dihydrogen phosphate (CDHP) solution, an aqueous solution of ionic liquid, to assemble DNA nanostructures of different sizes and complexities with enhanced biostability and ligand binding affinity. We show successful formation of the DNA nanostructures in aqueous CDHP solution using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and circular dichroism (CD). Biostability assays reveal that the aqueous CDHP solution may provide passive protection to DNA nanostructures against DNase I and human serum for up to 48 h. We also demonstrate that this enhanced biostability arises both from the structural conformation imparted during CDHP-mediated folding and from the presence of free CDHP ions in the solution. Notably, removal of free ions reduced the passive protection effect, but did not eliminate it, indicating the contribution of both folding and surrounding free ions. Using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we show that the presence of aqueous CDHP solution can enhance the binding of aptamer-functionalized DNA nanostructures to specific receptors on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Our strategy of using ionic liquid solution for one-pot preparation with enhanced stability and functionality offers a robust, simpler and faster alternative for DNA nanostructure-based constructs.

[PMID: 41187270] Cold molecules provide a unique platform for exploring quantum phenomena. Using the Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage (SARP) technique, it has, for example, been demonstrated that resonances are sensitive to the initial orientation/alignment of collisional partners at low collision temperatures. In this work, we investigate the stereodynamics of the following rotationally inelastic collision process through full-dimensional quantum scattering calculations, CO (<i>v</i><sub>1</sub> = 0, <i>j</i><sub>1</sub> = 0) + H<sub>2</sub> (<i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>j</i><sub>2</sub> = 2) → CO (<i>v</i><sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> = 0, <i>j</i><sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> = 0) + H<sub>2</sub> (<i>v</i><sub>2</sub><sup>'</sup> = <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>j</i><sub>2</sub><sup>'</sup> = 0), focusing on its dependence on vibrational excitation of a collision partner (<i>v</i><sub>2</sub>). The integral cross-section is shown to be overall vibrationally adiabatic with a slight red shift of 1 cm<sup>-1</sup> per <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> for the four main resonance peaks but with irregular relative scattering amplitudes. The horizontal SARP induces completely different effects on cross-sections for one of the resonances between different vibrational states: a 92.2% suppression for <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> = 0 versus a 120.7% enhancement for <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> = 1. Our findings establish vibrational-state-selective engineering as a potential paradigm for cold collision control.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.",10

[PMID: 41187199] Although prior research has indicated that nutritional and inflammatory markers may play a role in prostate cancer development, the exact interplay and underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The study population comprised 16,481 males from the NHANES database, after excluding participants with missing covariates. The Neutrophil Percentage-to-Albumin Ratio (NPAR) was used to assess the inflammation and nutritional status. Statistical methods such as multivariable logistic regression, eXtreme Gradient Boosting model, subgroup analysis, and Generalized Additive Model were used to analyze the relationship between NPAR and prostate cancer prevalence. The restricted cubic splines of the independent variable NPAR and the dependent variable (prostate cancer prevalence) were statistically significant based on the logistic regression analysis. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning model identified the NPAR and age as the most influential variables for prostate cancer. Subgroup analysis revealed significant correlations between the NPAR and age, race, and smoking status. Clinical validation has confirmed the diagnostic significance of NPAR in prostate cancer. A positive correlation was observed between NPAR and prostate cancer prevalence, indicating the potential mechanism of developing the disease. However, due to the cross-sectional design and self-reported cancer diagnoses in the NHANES database, causality cannot be established.

[PMID: 41187186] The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly accelerated the development of diagnostic techniques. Real‑time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was the method of choice for diagnosis and was considered as the gold standard. However, limited specificity of RT-PCR was noticed during the pandemic. This research aimed to develop a combined highly specific immune-based and highly sensitive molecular-based diagnostic technique. Groups of chicken were immunized with commercial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) N, S, and E antigens. The IgY antibodies were purified from eggs using a High-Trap IgY affinity column. Three unique DNA barcodes were designed, synthesized, and amplified using 5'-amine-labeled forward primers. DNA barcodes purified form PCR products were coupled to IgY antibodies using the (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) - N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC-NHS) coupling chemistry. ELISA; SDS-PAGEs; immunoblot (IB); and uniplex-, duplex- and multiplex immuno-PCR (IPCR) were used to confirm system validity. Amplification of single barcodes using RT-PCR showed a Ct value of 15, with no significant variation when amplified in duplex or multiplex formats. Chicken IgY-DNA barcode conjugation and reactivity were verified using IB and ELISA. IPCR resulted in efficient amplification of all three DNA barcodes in uniplex, duplex, and multiplex formats after binding to commercial N, S, and E antigens. The successful combination of the specific antibody-based techniques, low-cost chicken IgY antibodies, and RT-PCR sensitivity achieved in this study present a promising approach to meet the demand for sensitive and accurate diagnostics. This generic platform can be adopted in any analyte detection system.

[PMID: 41187160] The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a simple yet potent marker that has been established as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis. However, consensus is lacking regarding its prognostic value for predicting mortality risk in these patients. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify its clinical significance. We performed a literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies published from database inception until January 1, 2025. Studies focusing on the diagnosis of cirrhosis were included, while those involving children and neonates were excluded. Odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess heterogeneity, subgroup analysis to explore sources of heterogeneity, and Egger's test to evaluate publication bias. All analyses were performed using Review Manager (v5.4.1) and Stata (v15.0). A total of 18 studies involving 7,714 patients were included. Significant associations were obserced between the NLR and mortality (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.10-1.22; P < 0.00001), infection (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.37-0.96; P < 0.0001), and ascites (OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.43-2.88; P < 0.0001). However, no signficant correlation was found between the NLR and hepatic encephalopathy (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.89-2.00; P = 0.16). Subgroup analysis indicated that heterogeneity was partly attributable to variations in NLR cut-off values. Egger's test revealed significant publication bias only for mortality. NLR is a well-validated prognostic biomarker for mortality, infection, and ascites in patients with cirrhosis. PROSPERO, identifier CRD420251031417.

[PMID: 41187159] Adolescent opioid use in the United States commands attention: millions of twelve- to nineteen-year-olds are exposed to opioids each year by prescription and misuse. Recent findings show that opioids bind not only to canonical opioid receptors but also interact with receptors on immune cells within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The potential for early life opioid exposure to give rise to long-term changes in the neuroimmune system is not fully understood, particularly given the adolescent brain's high susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that adolescent opioid use potentiates physiological and behavioral responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness later in life. To achieve this, we treated adolescent (postnatal day 35-42) male and female C57/BL6 mice with saline or bi-daily escalating doses of morphine for 5 days to model opioid dependence and, in adulthood (postnatal day 60-67), administered saline or a low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) to promote an immune response. Body weight, body surface temperature, and locomotor activity were recorded up to 48 hours after LPS administration. Mice were also tested in the forced swim test 52 hours after LPS administration to assess depressive-like behavior. In contrast to our hypotheses, we found that adolescent morphine exposure had no additive effect on low-dose LPS-induced sickness measures when assessed in adulthood. These data suggest that adolescent opioid exposure may have minimal effects on future immune challenges, although further research is needed to confirm this.

[PMID: 41187080] Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP) plays a critical role in host defense against invading pathogens, including <i><i>Listeria</i> monocytogenes (<i>Listeria. monocytogenes</i>)</i>, <i><i>Salmonella typhimurium (<i>S. typhimurium</i>)</i></i>, and <i>Francisella novicida (<i>F. novicida</i>)</i>. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms controlling LAP remain poorly understood. Here, we identify enkurin domain-containing protein 1 (ENKD1) as a key negative regulator of LAP during infection with these pathogens. Macrophages infected with <i><i>L.</i> monocytogenes</i> (10403S), <i>S. typhimurium</i> (ATCC14028), or <i>F. novicida</i> (U112) exhibit significant ENKD1 downregulation. ENKD1-deficient macrophages display enhanced antibacterial activity, characterized by increased LAP, higher reactive oxygen species production, enhanced LC3 lipidation on phagosomes, and improved phagosome-lysosome fusion. In vivo, ENKD1<i>-</i>deficient mice <i>ex</i>hibited improved bacterial clearance in the liver and spleen, with notable survival benefits. Mechanistically, ENKD1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), which mediates degradation of Run domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein (RUBCN) through K48-linked polyubiquitination, thereby dampening RUBCN's role in LAP. Our findings reveal an ENKD1-TRIM21-RUBCN axis that suppresses LAP, providing insights into antibacterial immune regulation and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to enhance host defense against intracellular pathogens.

[PMID: 41187066] Mice often serve as valuable surrogate models for studying human reproduction. This study provides a single-cell transcriptomic profile of mouse immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout pregnancy and assesses the similarities and differences between these immune cells and human decidual immune cells. Homeostasis of the immune microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface is essential for pregnancy. Immune cell heterogeneity at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnant mice remains understudied. Here, we perform in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analysis with 120,238 maternal-fetal single cells of mice from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E18.5 and in vitro experiments to establish an immune cell atlas. Macrophages constitute the largest population, with some subsets resembling human counterparts, and the number of Ccr2 + macrophages in the decidua increases as pregnancy progresses. Neutrophils constitute the second largest population, and Ifit1 + N2 neutrophils are localized close to the implantation site during early pregnancy. Three NK cell subsets were identified, including the previously reported NK1.1 - subset. In combination with in vitro experiments, the presence of T and B cells within the decidua was validated. Our work profiles a comprehensive immune cell atlas of the mouse maternal-fetal interface, offering a valuable reference for further investigations.

[PMID: 41186894] Antimicrobial peptides (APs) are increasingly used in livestock production because of their effective antibacterial properties and low risk of causing drug resistance. However, their effects on intestinal barrier function in ruminants remain relatively unexplored. This study explored the effect of composite APs on colonic microbiota and barrier integrity in Holstein steers. Twelve steers were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 6): a control (CK) group that received a basal diet and an AP group that received the same diet supplemented with 8 g/ (d· head) of APs over a 270-day feeding period. After humanely killing, colonic tissue and contents were collected for analysis using histology, 16S rRNA sequencing, and metabolomics. The AP group demonstrated significantly increased mucosal thickness and mucin secretion (p < 0.05), enhanced activities of β-glucosidase, lipase, xylanase, cellulase, and pectinase (p < 0.01), elevated acetate, propionate, and butyrate levels (p < 0.05), upregulated polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) expression at both gene and protein levels (p < 0.05), reduced α-amylase activity (p < 0.01), and decreased density and abundance of immunoglobulin (Ig)A<sup>+</sup>, IgG<sup>+</sup> and IgM<sup>+</sup> cell clusters (p < 0.05). Additionally, AP supplementation induced functional reorganization of the intestinal microbiota. Microbial analysis indicated increased growth of beneficial bacteria, particularly Firmicutes and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, but a selective decrease in potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Metabolomic analysis suggested elevated lithocholic acid levels and modified lipid metabolism in the AP group. Correlation analysis demonstrated that alterations in colonic microbiota and metabolites were associated with enhanced intestinal barrier function. Hence, AP supplementation promotes intestinal health in Holstein steers by modulating epithelial development and microbial community composition.

[PMID: 41186833] 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) scans have largely replaced bone marrow biopsy in the staging workup for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here, we highlight a pitfall of FDG PET/CT for assessing bone marrow involvement, detailing the clinical course of a patient diagnosed with otherwise limited-stage DLBCL who exhibited diffuse bone marrow FDG uptake, felt to be compatible with extensive lymphomatous infiltration. In accordance with current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, this finding circumvented the need for a formal staging bone marrow biopsy procedure. Subsequent clinical developments revealed extensive bone marrow involvement by a second, unexpected malignancy (multiple myeloma), casting doubt on the assumption that the initial diffuse marrow uptake was attributable to DLBCL. The presented case emphasizes the challenges of interpreting diffuse FDG uptake within the bone marrow compartment and highlights the inherent contribution of histomorphology for the accurate diagnosis and classification of hematolymphoid neoplasms.",10

Four genome-wide association studies were combined using an SE-weighted meta-analysis. Within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, stepwise conditional analysis was undertaken to determine independently associated classical MHC class I alleles. Statistical tests for epistatic interaction were performed between risk alleles at the MHC and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) loci. Genome-wide significant locus associated with FFA and nonadditive effects on genetic risk between susceptibility loci. Of 6668 included patients, there were 1585 European female individuals with FFA and 5083 controls. Genome-wide significant associations were identified at 4 genomic loci, including a novel susceptibility locus at 5q15, and the association signal could be fine-mapped to a single nucleotide substitution (rs10045403) in the 5' untranslated region of ERAP1 (rs10045403; odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.43; P = 3.6 × 10-8). Within the MHC, FFA risk was statistically independently associated with HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*33:01, HLA-B*07:02, and HLA-B*35:01. FFA risk was affected by genetic variation at the ERAP1 locus only in individuals who carried at least 1 of the MHC class I risk alleles. In this genome-wide meta-analysis, a supra-additive effect of genetic variation was found that affected peptide trimming and antigen presentation on FFA susceptibility. Patients with FFA may benefit from emerging therapeutic approaches that modulate ERAP-mediated processes.

[PMID: 35954271] Epistasis of <i>ERAP1</i> single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and <i>HLA-B27</i> has been linked to ankylosing spondylitis susceptibility (AS). The current study examined how prevalent <i>ERAP1</i> allelic variants (SNV haplotypes) in Taiwan affect ERAP1 functions and AS susceptibility in the presence or absence of HLA-B27. Sanger sequencing was used to discover all <i>ERAP1</i> coding SNVs and common allelic variants in Taiwanese full-length cDNAs from 45 human patients. For the genetic association investigation, TaqMan genotyping assays were utilized to establish the genotypes of <i>ERAP1</i> SNVs in 863 AS patients and 1438 healthy controls. Ex vivo biological analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from homozygous donors of two common-risk <i>ERAP1</i> allelic variants was performed. Two common-risk <i>ERAP1</i> allelic variants were also cloned and functionally studied. In Taiwanese, eleven frequent <i>ERAP1</i> SNVs and six major <i>ERAP1</i> allelic variants were discovered. We discovered that in Taiwanese, the most prevalent <i>ERAP1</i>-001 variant with 56E, 127R, 276I, 349M, 528K, 575D, 725R, and 730Q interacting with <i>HLA-B27</i> significantly contributed to the development of AS. In <i>HLA-B27</i> negative group, however, the second most prevalent <i>ERAP1</i>-002 variant with 56E, 127P, 276M, 349M, 528R, 575D, 725R, and 730E was substantially related with an increased risk of AS. Ex vivo and in vitro research demonstrated that <i>ERAP1</i> allelic variants have a significant impact on ERAP1 functions, suggesting that ERAP1 plays a role in the development of AS. In an HLA-B27-dependent manner, common <i>ERAP1</i> allelic variants are related with AS susceptibility.

[PMID: 32804949] The killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), found predominantly on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells and some T-cells, are a collection of highly polymorphic activating and inhibitory receptors with variable specificity for class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands. Fifteen KIR genes are inherited in haplotypes of diverse gene content across the human population, and the repertoire of independently inherited KIR and HLA alleles is known to alter risk for immune-mediated and infectious disease by shifting the threshold of lymphocyte activation. We have conducted the largest disease-association study of KIR-HLA epistasis to date, enabled by the imputation of KIR gene and HLA allele dosages from genotype data for 12,214 healthy controls and 8,107 individuals with the HLA-B*27-associated immune-mediated arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We identified epistatic interactions between KIR genes and their ligands (at both HLA subtype and allele resolution) that increase risk of disease, replicating analyses in a semi-independent cohort of 3,497 cases and 14,844 controls. We further confirmed that the strong AS-association with a pathogenic variant in the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase gene ERAP1, known to alter the HLA-B*27 presented peptidome, is not modified by carriage of the canonical HLA-B receptor KIR3DL1/S1. Overall, our data suggests that AS risk is modified by the complement of KIRs and HLA ligands inherited, beyond the influence of HLA-B*27 alone, which collectively alter the proinflammatory capacity of KIR-expressing lymphocytes to contribute to disease immunopathogenesis.

[PMID: 30514861] Behçet's Disease (BD) pathogenesis remains unclear, but some genetic loci and environmental factors are proposed to play a role. Here, we investigate the association of the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 (ERAP1) gene variants and HLA-B*51 with BD susceptibility and clinical manifestations in Iranian patients. In the study, 748 BD patients and 776 healthy individuals were included. The MGB-TaqMan Allelic Discrimination method was used to genotype 10 common missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one intronic SNP in the ERAP1 gene region. We found no significant association between the 11 SNPs and BD in allelic and genotypic association tests. However, rs30187 showed the strongest association with BD in the recessive genotype model of the risk T allele in HLA-B*51 carriers. Although this became insignificant after correcting for multiple comparisons, the homozygous rs30187 risk allele genotype (TT) increased disease susceptibility in HLA-B*51 carriers in epistasis analysis, and the rs30187 TT recessive genotype showed a significant association with risk of cardiac involvement in the all patients and articular involvements in HLA-B*51 positive patients. Our findings suggest that gene-gene interactions between HLA-B*51 and ERAP1 variants is important for BD development, however, ERAP1 variants which interact with HLA-B*51 may differ among disease phenotypes or populations.

[PMID: 29632046] The Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase I (ERAP1) trims peptides to their optimal size for binding to Major Histocompatibility Complex class I proteins. The natural polymorphism of this enzyme is associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in epistasis with the major risk factor for this disease, HLA-B*27, suggesting a direct relationship between AS and HLA-B*27-bound peptides. Three polymorphisms that affect peptide trimming protect from AS: K528R, D575N/R725Q, and Q730E. We characterized and ranked the effects of each mutation, and their various combinations, by quantitative comparisons of the HLA-B*27 peptidomes from cells expressing distinct ERAP1 variants. Five features were examined: peptide length, N-terminal flanking residues, N-terminal residues of the natural ligands, internal sequences and affinity for B*27:05. Polymorphism at residue 528 showed the largest influence, affecting all five features regardless of peptide length. D575N/R725Q showed a much smaller effect. Yet, when co-occurring with K528R, it further decreased ERAP1 activity. Polymorphism at residue 730 showed a significant influence on peptide length, because of distinct effects on trimming of nonamers compared with longer peptides. Accordingly, multiple features were affected by the Q730E mutation in a length-dependent way. The alterations induced in the B*27:05 peptidome by natural ERAP1 variants with different K528R/Q730E combinations reflected separate and additive effects of both mutations. Thus, the influence of ERAP1 on HLA-B*27 is very diverse at the population level, because of the multiplicity and complexity of ERAP1 variants, and to the distinct effects of their co-occurring polymorphisms, leading to significant modulation of disease risk among HLA-B*27-positive individuals.

[PMID: 28867178] Interferon-γ-induced aminopeptidase ERAP1 trims peptides within the endoplasmic reticulum so that they can be loaded onto MHC class I and presented to the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. ERAP1 association and its interaction with HLA-C∗06 is controversial across different populations. We have investigated the association and possible functional role of non-synonymous SNPs at different exons of ERAP1 (rs26653: Arg127Pro, rs30187: Lys528Arg and rs27044: Gln730Glu) and their interactions with HLA-C∗06 in psoriasis. Significant associations of HLA-C∗06 (OR=5.47, P<2.2×10<sup>-16</sup>), rs30187 (OR 1.35, P=7.4×10<sup>-4</sup>) and rs27044 (OR=1.24, P=5.8×10<sup>-3</sup>) were observed. All three ERAP1 SNPs showed significant association only for HLA-C∗06 positive patients, while rs30187 and rs27044 showed significant association only for early onset patients (rs30187: OR=1.47, P=9.6×10<sup>-5</sup>; rs27044: OR=1.36, P=3.3×10<sup>-4</sup>). No differential expression of ERAP1 was observed either between paired uninvolved and involved skin tissues of psoriasis patients or between non-risk and risk variants in the involved skin. Significant epistatic interaction was observed between HLA-C∗06 and the SNP (rs27044) located at the peptide-binding cavity of ERAP1. Evolutionary conservation analysis among mammals showed confinement of Lys528 and Gln730 within highly conserved regions of ERAP1 and suggested the possible detrimental effect of this allele in ERAP1 regulation.

[PMID: 25994336] Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common, highly heritable, inflammatory arthritis for which HLA-B*27 is the major genetic risk factor, although its role in the aetiology of AS remains elusive. To better understand the genetic basis of the MHC susceptibility loci, we genotyped 7,264 MHC SNPs in 22,647 AS cases and controls of European descent. We impute SNPs, classical HLA alleles and amino-acid residues within HLA proteins, and tested these for association to AS status. Here we show that in addition to effects due to HLA-B*27 alleles, several other HLA-B alleles also affect susceptibility. After controlling for the associated haplotypes in HLA-B, we observe independent associations with variants in the HLA-A, HLA-DPB1 and HLA-DRB1 loci. We also demonstrate that the ERAP1 SNP rs30187 association is not restricted only to carriers of HLA-B*27 but also found in HLA-B*40:01 carriers independently of HLA-B*27 genotype.

[PMID: 25939665] Genome-wide association interaction (GWAI) studies have increased in popularity. Yet to date, no standard protocol exists. In practice, any GWAI workflow involves making choices about quality control strategy, SNP filtering, linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning, analytic tool to model or to test for genetic interactions. Each of these can have an impact on the final epistasis findings and may affect their reproducibility in follow-up analyses. Choosing an analytic tool is not straightforward, as different tools exist and current understanding about their performance is based on often very particular simulation settings. In the present study, we wish to create awareness for the impact of (minor) changes in a GWAI analysis protocol can have on final epistasis findings. In particular, we investigate the influence of marker selection and marker prioritization strategies, LD pruning and the choice of epistasis detection analytics on study results, giving rise to 8 GWAI protocols. Discussions are made in the context of the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) data obtained via the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC2). As expected, the largest impact on AS epistasis findings is caused by the choice of marker selection criterion, followed by marker coding and LD pruning. In MB-MDR, co-dominant coding of main effects is more robust to the effects of LD pruning than additive coding. We were able to reproduce previously reported epistasis involvement of HLA-B and ERAP1 in AS pathology. In addition, our results suggest involvement of MAGI3 and PARK2, responsible for cell adhesion and cellular trafficking. Gene ontology biological function enrichment analysis across the 8 considered GWAI protocols also suggested that AS could be associated to the central nervous system malfunctions, specifically, in nerve impulse propagation and in neurotransmitters metabolic processes.

[PMID: 25019531] Behçet's disease (BD) is a multifactorial disorder associated with the HLA region. Recently, the ERAP1 gene has been proposed as a susceptibility locus with a recessive model and with epistatic interaction with HLA-B51. ERAP1 trims peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum to optimize their length for MHC-I binding. Polymorphisms in this gene have been related with the susceptibility to other immune-mediated diseases associated to HLA class I. Our aim was, the replication in the Spanish population of the association described in the Turkish population between ERAP1 (rs17482078) and BD. Additionally, in order to improve the understanding of this association we analyzed four additional SNPs (rs27044, rs10050860, rs30187 and rs2287987) associated with other diseases related to HLA class I and the haplotype blocks in this gene region. According to our results, frequencies of the homozygous genotypes for the minor alleles of all the SNPs were increased among patients and the OR values were higher in the subgroup of patients with the HLA-B risk factors, although differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, the presence of the same mutation in both chromosomes increased the OR values from 4.51 to 10.72 in individuals carrying the HLA-B risk factors. Therefore, although they were not statistically significant, our data were consistent with an association between ERAP1 and BD as well as with an epistatic interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-B in the Spanish population.

[PMID: 23916068] The endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the final processing of Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) ligands and with a significant influence in the stability and immunological properties of MHC-I proteins. ERAP1 polymorphism is associated with ankylosing spondylitis among HLA-B27-positive individuals and the altered enzymatic activity of natural variants has significant effects on the HLA-B27 peptidome, suggesting a critical pathogenetic role of peptides in this disease. Likewise, the association of ERAP1 with other MHC-I associated disorders and its epistasis with their susceptibility MHC alleles point out to a general role of the MHC-I peptidome in these diseases. The functional interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-B27 or other MHC-I molecules may be related to the processing of specific epitopes, or to a more general peptide-dependent influence on other biological features of the MHC-I proteins. In addition, from a consideration of the reported functions of ERAP1, including its involvement in angiogenesis and macrophage activation, a more complex and multi-level influence in the inflammatory and immune pathways operating in these diseases cannot be ruled out.",10

Controversies persist about the management of PDA in extremely preterm infants. PDA is associated with morbidities, but no therapeutic strategy has resulted in an improved neonatal outcome. Acetaminophen appears to be a promising alternative with possibly fewer adverse effects. The primary objective is to determine whether a prophylactic pharmacological intervention with acetaminophen may increase the survival without severe morbidity at postmenstrual age of 36 weeks. TREOCAPA phase III is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled superiority trial, two arms in a 1:1 ratio performed in 43 NICUs of 14 European countries, evaluating whether the intervention increases the survival without severe morbidity by 10%, from 50% in control arm to 60% in treatment arm, until the age of 36 postmenstrual weeks. To detect this difference, 794 patients were required using a group sequential design. Recruitment has been closed, with 803 patients enrolled. Patients eligible for inclusion are preterm infants with a gestational age between 23 and 28 weeks. In the acetaminophen group, 20 mg/kg loading dose within 12 h after birth, followed by 7.5 mg/kg quarter in die (QID) for 5 days, will be administered to the 27-28 weeks gestational age group, and 25 mg/kg loading dose then 10 mg/kg QID will be administered to the 23-26 weeks gestational age group. The severe morbidities include severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD grade 3) according to NIH consensus, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) of Bell's stage II or III, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade III-IV according to Papile classification, or cystic leukomalacia. Whatever the results, the conclusions of this study should be informative for the neonatal scientific community. The results will either confirm the benefit of treatment in increasing survival without severe morbidity, or indicate a worsening of outcomes with prophylactic acetaminophen treatment, or show no difference in the primary outcome. In the latter case, ultrasonographic assessments of ductus arteriosus status on day 7 may help explain the absence of a difference. This could indicate that acetaminophen is ineffective in promoting ductal closure or that early closure of the ductus arteriosus is inconsequential if, despite more frequent closures, there is no associated improvement in outcomes. Ethical approval of the trial has been performed in each of the 14 countries after approval, at the European level, by the Voluntary Harmonization Procedure committee on 04/07/2020. Results will be disseminated through articles in peer-reviewed journals. European Clinical Trials Database: EudraCT Number: 2019-004297-26. gov: NCT04459117, registered on July 7, 2020.

[PMID: 39592675] Echocardiography is the gold standard of diagnosis and evaluation of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a common condition among preterm infants that can cause hemodynamic abnormalities and increased mortality rates, but this technique requires a skilled specialist and is not always available. Meanwhile, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is also known to exhibit signs of PDA and is a routine imaging modality in neonatal intensive care units. In this study, we aim to find and objectively define CXR image features that are associated with PDA by training and visually analyzing a deep learning model. We first collected 4617 echocardiograms from neonatal intensive care unit patients and 17,448 CXR images that were taken 4 days before to 3 days after the echocardiograms were obtained. We trained a deep learning model to predict the presence of severe PDA using the CXR images, and then visualized the model using GradCAM++ to identify the regions of the CXR images important for the model's prediction. The visualization results showed that the model focused on the regions around the upper thorax, lower left heart, and lower right lung. Based on these results, we hypothesized and evaluated three radiographic features of PDA: cardiothoracic ratio, upper heart width to maximum heart width ratio, and upper heart width to thorax width ratio. We then trained an XGBoost model to predict the presence of severe PDA using these radiographic features combined with clinical features. The model achieved an AUC of 0.74, with a high specificity of 0.94. Our study suggests that the proposed radiographic features of CXR images can be used as an auxiliary tool to predict the presence of PDA in preterm infants. This can be useful for the early detection of PDA in neonatal intensive care units in cases where echocardiography is not available.

[PMID: 38750445] To explore a method for screening and diagnosing neonatal congenital heart disease (CHD) applicable to grassroots level, evaluate the prevalence of CHD, and establish a hierarchical management system for CHD screening and treatment at the grassroots level. A total of 24,253 newborns born in Tang County between January 2016 and December 2020 were consecutively enrolled and screened by trained primary physicians via the ""twelve-section ultrasonic screening and diagnosis method"" (referred to as the ""twelve-section method""). Specialized staff from the CHD Screening and Diagnosis Center of Hebei Children's Hospital regularly visited the local area for definite diagnosis of CHD in newborns who screened positive. Newborns with CHD were managed according to the hierarchical management system. The centre confirmed that, except for 2 newborns with patent ductus arteriosus missed in the diagnosis of ventricular septal defect combined with severe pulmonary hypertension, newborns with other isolated or concomitant simple CHDs were identified at the grassroots level. The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic coincidence rate of the twelve-section method for screening complex CHD were 92%, 99.6% and 84%, respectively. A total of 301 children with CHD were identified. The overall CHD prevalence was 12.4‰. According to the hierarchical management system, 113 patients with simple CHD recovered spontaneously during local follow-up, 48 patients continued local follow-up, 106 patients were referred to the centre for surgery (including 17 patients with severe CHD and 89 patients with progressive CHD), 1 patient died without surgery, and 8 patients were lost to follow-up. Eighteen patients with complex CHD were directly referred to the centre for surgery, 3 patients died without surgery, and 4 patients were lost to follow-up. Most patients who received early intervention achieved satisfactory results. The mortality rate of CHD was approximately 28.86 per 100,000 children. The ""twelve-section method"" is suitable for screening neonatal CHD at the grassroots level. The establishment of a hierarchical management system for CHD screening and treatment is conducive to the scientific management of CHD, which has important clinical and social significance for early detection, early intervention, reduction in mortality and improvement of the prognosis of complex and severe CHDs.

[PMID: 35768356] <b>Objectives:</b> To investigate the risk factors and short-term prognosis of early pulmonary hypertension (PH) in preterm infants. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective case-control study was performed in preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 2012 to December 2019. Eighty preterm infants with a diagnosis of PH between 3 and 14 days (early PH group) were matched in gestational age and sex with the controls (1∶2) of the same period in NICU. Perinatal clinical records, complications, echocardiography and early outcomes were collected. Characteristics and outcomes were compared between the two groups with <i>t</i>-test, nonparametric test or Chi-square test. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to analyze the predictive factors of early PH. <b>Results:</b> The gestational age of the early PH group and the control group were both (27.9±1.4) weeks, and 52 (65.0%) and 104 (65.0%) were males in each group, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that birth weights were lower in the early PH group than those in the control group (1 030 (850, 1 200) <i>vs.</i> 1 110 (1 000, 1 278) g, <i>Z=</i>-3.27, <i>P=</i>0.001). The early PH group had higher rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension, prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) >1 week, born by caesarean, small for gestational age (SGA), 1 and 5 min Apgar score ≤7 scores, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and hemodynamic significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) (12.5% (10/80) <i>vs.</i> 3.8% (6/160), 11.2% (9/80) <i>vs.</i> 3.8% (6/160), 48.8% (39/80) <i>vs.</i> 28.8% (46/160), 10.0% (8/80) <i>vs.</i> 1.9% (3/160), 70.8% (51/72) <i>vs.</i> 51.7% (74/143), 50.0% (36/72) <i>vs.</i> 20.3% (29/143), 88.8% (71/80) <i>vs.</i> 59.4% (95/160), 85.0% (68/80) <i>vs.</i> 22.5% (36/160), χ<sup>2</sup><i>=</i>6.56, 5.12, 3.31, 8.05, 7.17, 20.05, 21.58, 84.84, all <i>P</i><0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the independent predictive factors of early PH were PROM >1 week, SGA, 5 min Apgar score ≤7 scores, nenonatal RDS and hsPDA (<i>OR=</i>10.40, 18.61, 4.47, 4.13, 20.10, 95%<i>CI</i> 1.93-56.12, 2.82-122.76, 1.91-10.46, 1.50-11.39, 8.28-48.80, all <i>P</i><0.05),respectively. Infants with early PH had higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), BPD associated PH, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), extrauterine growth retardation (EUGR), laser treatment for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and mortality than the controls (all <i>P<</i>0.05). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was also longer in the early PH group than that in the control group (<i>P<</i>0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Risk of early PH will be increased in preterm infants with PROM >1 week, SGA, 5 min Apgar score ≤7 scores, and comorbidities of nenonatal RDS and hsPDA. Early PH is associated with increased mortality, BPD, BPD associated PH, severe IVH, EUGR and laser treatment for ROP.

[PMID: 30153942] Anorectal malformation (ARM) is a common condition. Owing to scarcity of pediatric surgery services in Uganda, however, relatively little is known about this condition. This was a retrospective review of medical records of all patients admitted to Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) from January 2014 to May 2016. MRRH serves 3-8 million people in southwest Uganda. We also enrolled patients prospectively from June 2016 to December 2016. 78 patients were enrolled in the study. 63.38% had delayed diagnosis (presenting >48 h after birth), and most of these were self-referrals from home. The most common malformation was a vestibular fistula. Associated congenital anomalies were seen in 20% of patients, and this was associated with increased mortality. These anomalies included limb, eye, ear and genitourinary anomalies as well as ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, spina bifida and tracheoesophageal fistula. Posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) was the definitive surgery used. It was performed in 58.97% of the patients. Median age of patients who underwent PSARP was 11 months. 73.91% of PSARP patients had their colostomies closed and 62.5% of these who were ≥3 years old had good continence outcomes. Overall mortality rate was 8.97%. The majority of patients are diagnosed late. Vestibular fistula is the overall most common type of ARM. In males, however, rectourethral fistula is the most common type. Definitive surgery at MRRH is performed late. Continence outcomes are good and comparable to other countries with more resources.

[PMID: 25322995] Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs in 70% of extremely low birth weight (ELBW, birth weight <1000 g) infants. Approximately 34% of ELBW infants with a PDA have spontaneous closure. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close has been associated with multiple morbidities. To examine variability over time and across hospitals in early therapeutic (2-7 day) use of indomethacin (INDO) vs ibuprofen (IBU) for PDA treatment in outborn ELBW infants and examine the outcomes and side effects of both pharmacological agents in this population. Data were extracted from the Pediatric Health Information System. ELBW infants born between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010 and admitted on day of life 0 were eligible for inclusion. 732 infants had a PDA diagnosis and met inclusion criteria. We explored the variability in PDA pharmacotherapy over time and across hospitals. We compared outcomes of both agents for in-hospital mortality, need for surgical ligation, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, renal failure, and persistent pulmonary hypertension. Statistical methods included chi square and multivariable regression analysis. Instrumental variable analysis was used to control for selection bias and omitted variables. There was large variability in PDA pharmacotherapy over time and across hospitals. INDO use declined as IBU use grew from 12.8 to 38.9%. There was no difference in hospital or NICU characteristics between high and low IBU using NICUs. Renal failure was more common in infants receiving INDO compared to IBU. We noted large variability in PDA pharmacotherapy. Renal failure was more common with INDO use. Until further studies to compare the long-term effects of both drugs, our data support IBU as the preferred medication for PDA pharmacotherapy in ELBW infants.

[PMID: 25173927] The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate a two-stage double switch operation, morphological left ventricular (mLV) retraining followed by an atrial-arterial switch operation, in the management of patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) and a deconditioned mLV. Between May 2005 and May 2011, 14 patients with CCTGA and a deconditioned mLV anomaly underwent the two-stage double switch operation. There were eight males and six females aged between 2.5 and 72 months (mean: 34.4 ± 24.0 months) old and weighing from 5 to 23 kg (mean: 12.7 ± 4.9 kg). The major associated malformations included: tricuspid regurgitation (TR, n = 13); restrictive ventricular septal defect (n = 10); atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale (n = 7); mild pulmonary stenosis (n = 5) and patent ductus arteriosus (n = 4). These patients underwent morphological left ventricular retraining by means of pulmonary artery banding under general anaesthesia, which was then followed by a double switch operation under general anaesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass. There were no deaths or complications during the hospital stay or follow-up for the mLV retraining. In comparison with preoperative conditions, the mLV end-diastolic diameter (mLVEDd), the posterior wall thickness of the mLV and the mLV/mRV pressure ratio were all increased; the interventricular septum had moved partially to the midline position and TR had decreased. After the atrial-arterial switch procedure, 2 patients died during the perioperative period. The causes of death included serious cardiac arrhythmia with circulatory collapse and sudden death. The others were followed up for 2-8 years: 1 patient died from serious cardiac arrhythmias with circulatory collapse in the follow-up period. With regard to the others, 8 were evaluated as New York Heart Association Functional Class I, and the other 3 as Class II. Moderate aortic valve regurgitation was noted in 3 patients and moderate mitral regurgitation in 1 patient. For CCTGA children with degraded mLV, the two-stage double switch procedure can be performed with low mortality and morbidity and may be an appealing alternative to conventional repair. mLV retraining should be performed as early as possible. The second-stage atrial-arterial switch procedure showed satisfactory early and mid-term results. More attention should be paid to the long-term function of the mLV and the aortic valve.

[PMID: 11380960] Most pregnant women in New South Wales undergo obstetric ultrasound examination, including some assessment of fetal cardiac anatomy. We aimed to review the spectrum of cardiac defects, management and outcome data of all fetuses with diagnosis of major congenital heart disease between 1994 and 1996 and compare them to major congenital heart disease in infants born during the same 3-year study period. Descriptive comprehensive study of the New South Wales population. Study centers included the single fetal echocardiographic referral service and the two pediatric cardiac centers of New South Wales. Ninety-seven fetuses and 562 infants with major congenital heart disease were identified (240,000 livebirths), resulting in a prenatal detection rate of 15%. Anomalies detectable by cardiac four-chamber views were diagnosed at an average rate of 30% (68/229) in utero. By contrast, lesions associated with abnormal ventricular outflow and great artery views were detected in only 6.7% (29/430; P < 0.0001) of cases prior to birth. Of the 97 fetuses, 29 were aborted, 16 died in utero, and 9 died early postnatally without treatment. Within 2 weeks of age, 23% with fetal and 40% (P < 0.05) with infant major congenital heart disease diagnosis required an intervention, mainly for patent ductus arteriosus dependent lesions. Postnatal survival was similar for the fetal and infant series up to 2 years of age: 77% (95% confidence interval 64-90%) vs. 85% (95% confidence interval 82-88%). Prenatal diagnosis has important implications for pregnancy outcome, in particular for univentricular lesions. However, the present mode of obstetric routine ultrasound scanning fails to identify most ductus arteriosus dependent cardiac lesions with a predictable need for early postnatal intervention.

[PMID: 41187383] High breast density impairs mammographic cancer detection. We investigated if contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) performance is less affected by density compared to conventional mammography, addressing this critical gap. This study retrospectively included 326 adult female patients. The study protocol was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform. Each image was annotated and evaluated by a minimum of two expert radiologists, while a team of radiologists produced detailed medical reports and manual segmentation annotations for abnormal findings. The reference standards for lesion classification included follow-up assessments and pathological evaluations. The overall malignant breast lesion diagnosis for CESM yielded a sensitivity of 95.4 % (95 % CI = 92.4 %-97.5 %) and a specificity of 94.0 % (95 % CI = 91.8 %-95.7 %). Conventional mammography demonstrated a sensitivity of 85.0 % (CI = 80.5 %-88.8 %) and a specificity of 93.5 % (95 % CI = 91.3 %-95.3 %), which were both slightly lower than those achieved with CESM. In level A density, both conventional mammography and CESM demonstrated complete sensitivity and specificity. At density levels B, C, and D, CESM demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional mammography. Our findings indicate that as breast density transitions from fatty (level A) to dense (level D), CESM retains its sensitivity, while conventional mammography shows a decrease. Integrating CESM into clinics could enhance reporting systems and facilitate clinical decision-making, especially for patients with dense breast tissue. CESM showed superior diagnostic performance in the detection of malignant lesions compared to conventional mammography. CESM retains its diagnostic performance at varying levels of breast densities in contrast to conventional mammography.",10

To establish a robust in vitro cellular model for investigating PRRSV-host interactions, this study utilized CD163-knockout transgenic pigs previously generated in our laboratory and isolated porcine auricular marginal fibroblasts (PAMFs). Porcine-derived OSKM reprogramming factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC) were delivered via a Tet-On lentiviral system combined with an LBCSV reprogramming protocol, leading to the successful generation of a CD163-deficient porcine induced pluripotent stem cell line (CD163-KO iPSC). Effective integration of exogenous reprogramming factors was confirmed during induction, and alkaline phosphatase staining showed strong positivity in CD163-KO iPSC colonies, preliminarily demonstrating their pluripotent characteristics. Further analyses, including quantitative PCR, semi-quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot, confirmed successful reprogramming, as evidenced by the upregulated expression of the pluripotency markers NANOG and SALL4 at both the mRNA and protein levels, along with a considerable downregulation of the somatic cell marker THY1 at the mRNA level. RNA-seq analysis revealed that CD163-KO iPSC exhibited significant upregulation of pluripotency genes (e.g., OCT4, ESRRB) compared to porcine embryonic fibroblasts (PEFs), along with downregulation of developmental genes and enhanced basal metabolic activity. Embryoid body spontaneous differentiation and primordial germ cell-like cell induction experiments demonstrated that this cell line not only exhibited excellent gene editing compatibility but also possessed defined multilineage differentiation potential, thereby providing a reliable in vitro model platform for in-depth investigation of PRRSV infection mechanisms and host-pathogen interactions. This study not only offers a novel tool for elucidating viral entry mechanisms, but also lays a solid foundation for the development of antiviral strategies against PRRSV and the control of porcine viral diseases.

[PMID: 37832543] A complete knockout of a single key pluripotency gene may drastically affect embryonic stem cell function and epigenetic reprogramming. In contrast, elimination of only one allele of a single pluripotency gene is mostly considered harmless to the cell. To understand whether complex haploinsufficiency exists in pluripotent cells, we simultaneously eliminated a single allele in different combinations of two pluripotency genes (i.e., Nanog<sup>+/-</sup>;Sall4<sup>+/-</sup>, Nanog<sup>+/-</sup>;Utf1<sup>+/-</sup>, Nanog<sup>+/-</sup>;Esrrb<sup>+/-</sup> and Sox2<sup>+/-</sup>;Sall4<sup>+/-</sup>). Although these double heterozygous mutant lines similarly contribute to chimeras, fibroblasts derived from these systems show a significant decrease in their ability to induce pluripotency. Tracing the stochastic expression of Sall4 and Nanog at early phases of reprogramming could not explain the seen delay or blockage. Further exploration identifies abnormal methylation around pluripotent and developmental genes in the double heterozygous mutant fibroblasts, which could be rescued by hypomethylating agent or high OSKM levels. This study emphasizes the importance of maintaining two intact alleles for pluripotency induction.

[PMID: 29048434] Previous evidences have proved that porcine-induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) could be induced to distinctive metastable pluripotent states. This raises the issue of whether there is a common transcriptomic profile existing among the piPSC lines at distinctive state. In this study, we performed conjoint analysis of small RNA-seq and mRNA-seq for three piPSC lines which represent LIF dependence, FGF2 dependence and LFB2i dependence, respectively. Interestingly, we found there are 16 common microRNAs which potentially target 13 common mRNAs among the three piPSC lines. Dual-luciferase reporter assay validated that miR-370, one of the 16 common microRNAs, could directly target the 3'UTR of LIN28A. When the differentiation occurred, miR-370 could be activated in piPSCs and switched off the expression of LIN28A. Ectopic expression of miR-370 in piPSCs could reduce LIN28A expression, decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity, slow down the proliferation, and further cause the downregulation of downstream pluripotent genes (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SALL4 and ESRRB) and upregulation of differentiation relevant genes (SOX9, JARID2 and JMJD4). Moreover, these phenotypes caused by miR-370 could be rescued by overexpressing LIN28A. Collectively, our findings suggest that a set of common miRNA-mRNA interactions exist among the distinct piPSC lines, which orchestrate the self-renewal and differentiation of piPSCs independent of their metastable pluripotent states.

[PMID: 28457890] The core pluripotency transcription factor NANOG is critical for embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming. Although NANOG is phosphorylated at multiple residues, the role of NANOG phosphorylation in ESC self-renewal is incompletely understood, and no information exists regarding its functions during reprogramming. Here we report our findings that NANOG phosphorylation is beneficial, although nonessential, for ESC self-renewal, and that loss of phosphorylation enhances NANOG activity in reprogramming. Mutation of serine 65 in NANOG to alanine (S65A) alone has the most significant impact on increasing NANOG reprogramming capacity. Mechanistically, we find that pluripotency regulators (ESRRB, OCT4, SALL4, DAX1, and TET1) are transcriptionally primed and preferentially associated with NANOG S65A at the protein level due to presumed structural alterations in the N-terminal domain of NANOG. These results demonstrate that a single phosphorylation site serves as a critical interface for controlling context-dependent NANOG functions in pluripotency and reprogramming.

[PMID: 26798492] Every year, the list of mammalian species for which cultures of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are generated increases. PSCs are a unique tool for extending the limits of experimental studies and modeling different biological processes. In this work, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the hybrids of common voles Microtus levis and Microtus arvalis, which are used as model objects to study genome organization on the molecular-genetic level and the mechanisms of X-chromosome inactivation, have been generated. Vole iPSCs were isolated and cultured in a medium containing cytokine LIF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), ascorbic acid, and fetal bovine serum. Undifferentiated state of vole iPSCs is maintained by activation of their endogenous pluripotency genes - Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Sall4, and Esrrb. The cells were able to maintain undifferentiated state for at least 28 passages without change in their morphology and give rise to three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) upon differentiation.

[PMID: 26523946] Identification of a gene set capable of driving rapid and proper reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is an important issue. Here we show that the efficiency and kinetics of iPSC reprogramming are dramatically improved by the combined expression of Jarid2 and genes encoding its associated proteins. We demonstrate that forced expression of JARID2 promotes iPSC reprogramming by suppressing the expression of Arf, a known reprogramming barrier, and that the N-terminal half of JARID2 is sufficient for such promotion. Moreover, JARID2 accelerated silencing of the retroviral Klf4 transgene and demethylation of the Nanog promoter, underpinning the potentiating activity of JARID2 in iPSC reprogramming. We further show that JARID2 physically interacts with ESRRB, SALL4A, and PRDM14, and that these JARID2-associated proteins synergistically and robustly facilitate iPSC reprogramming in a JARID2-dependent manner. Our findings provide an insight into the important roles of JARID2 during reprogramming and suggest that the JARID2-associated protein network contributes to overcoming reprogramming barriers.

[PMID: 25192464] Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are commonly generated by transduction of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc (OSKM) into cells. Although iPSCs are pluripotent, they frequently exhibit high variation in terms of quality, as measured in mice by chimera contribution and tetraploid complementation. Reliably high-quality iPSCs will be needed for future therapeutic applications. Here, we show that one major determinant of iPSC quality is the combination of reprogramming factors used. Based on tetraploid complementation, we found that ectopic expression of Sall4, Nanog, Esrrb, and Lin28 (SNEL) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) generated high-quality iPSCs more efficiently than other combinations of factors including OSKM. Although differentially methylated regions, transcript number of master regulators, establishment of specific superenhancers, and global aneuploidy were comparable between high- and low-quality lines, aberrant gene expression, trisomy of chromosome 8, and abnormal H2A.X deposition were distinguishing features that could potentially also be applicable to human.

[PMID: 41185855] Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a severe and recurrent complication of diabetes that significantly increase the risk of infection, amputation, and mortality. Conventional therapies often fail to achieve complete healing due to the complex microenvironment characterized by ischemia, chronic inflammation, neuropathy, and oxidative stress. Stem-cell-based interventions offer a multifaceted therapeutic strategy by promoting angiogenesis, modulating immune responses, reducing oxidative damage, and enhancing extracellular matrix remodeling. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of major stem-cell sources including bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-MSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Comparative evaluation highlights that ADSCs are advantageous for autologous use and easy harvesting, BM-MSCs have the longest clinical track record, UCB-MSCs offer low immunogenicity for allogeneic applications, and iPSCs provide customizable options but require genomic stability monitoring. Increasing evidence supports the use of cell-free approaches, particularly exosome and secretome-based therapies, which reproduce stem-cell paracrine effects while minimizing ethical and safety concerns. Integration of these biologics with advanced biomaterials and nanoplatforms further enhances local retention, controlled release, and wound microenvironment regulation. Despite encouraging results, challenges remain in standardizing cell preparation, optimizing dosage and delivery, and ensuring long-term safety and cost-effectiveness. Future directions include harmonizing clinical protocols, expanding exosome-based therapeutics, and conducting large multicenter trials to validate their efficacy in real-world DFU management.

[PMID: 41185737] Spermatocytic tumor is a rare type of testicular germ cell tumor, accounting for approximately 1% of all testicular neoplasms. A 51-year-old male presented to the hospital with a painless mass in the left testis. Ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous intratesticular mass with cystic components. Testicular tumor markers were within normal ranges. The patient underwent a left orchiectomy. Pathologically, the tumor was characterized by the presence of medium to large neoplastic cells and small neoplastic cells without sarcomatoid or anaplastic features. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for SALL4 and negative for CD30, AFP, OCT3/4, PLAP, D2-40, and hCG. Based on these findings, we diagnosed spermatocytic tumor of testis. We present a case of spermatocytic tumor, which is a distinct entity among testicular germ cell tumors, with a generally favorable prognosis following orchiectomy. However, long-term follow-up is recommended due to the potential for late metastasis.

[PMID: 41185729] Spermatocytic tumor is rare, accounting for approximately 1% of all testicular neoplasms. It is clinically and pathologically distinct from classical seminoma and typically presents as a unilateral, slow-growing mass in older men. A 54-year-old man presented with painless bilateral scrotal swelling. Imaging revealed heterogeneous masses in both testes, and laboratory findings were within normal limits. Left high orchiectomy revealed polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm, initially suggesting seminoma. Given the patient's age and histological features, immunohistochemistry was performed. A right high orchiectomy was subsequently conducted. Both tumors were diagnosed as spermatocytic tumors based on SALL4 positivity and PLAP, c-kit, and Vimentin negativity. The patient developed postoperative hypogonadism and began testosterone replacement therapy. No recurrence was observed during 1-year follow-up. This rare case of synchronous bilateral spermatocytic tumor highlights the importance of considering this diagnosis in older men with bilateral testicular masses. Immunohistochemistry is essential for accurate identification.",10

However, the intrinsic mechanisms regulating these responses are unknown. Here, we report that deletion of both transcription factors Egr2 and Egr3 in lymphocytes resulted in a lethal autoimmune syndrome with excessive serum proinflammatory cytokines but also impaired antigen receptor-induced proliferation of B and T cells. Egr2- and Egr3-defective B and T cells had hyperactive signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and STAT3 while antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factor AP-1 was severely impaired. We discovered that Egr2 and/or Egr3 directly induced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, inhibitors of STAT1 and STAT3, and also blocked the function of Batf, an AP-1 inhibitor, in B and T cells. Thus, Egr2 and Egr3 regulate B and T cell function in adaptive immune responses and homeostasis by promoting antigen receptor signaling and controlling inflammation.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187377] Foodborne contaminants, such as mycotoxins and microplastics, pose significant threats to human health due to their high toxicity and persistence in the food chain, thus necessitate effective mitigation strategies. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), characterized by high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, safety, and environmental friendliness, offer a promising solution for adsorbing these pollutants. This review systematically explores the roles, binding locations, interaction forces, and molecular mechanisms underlying LAB-contaminant interactions, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetic properties of the adsorption processes. Notably, LAB strains with outstanding adsorption capabilities are spotlighted, along with innovative enhancement strategies: optimized culture conditions, co-culture systems, nanoparticle functionalization, immobilized cells, and combinations with bio-adsorbents. The review further demonstrates the applications of LAB in ensuring safe food production and maintaining biological health. Future directions include multi-omics-driven gene discovery, genetic engineering techniques for precision regulation, and machine learning for adsorption optimization, advancing mechanistic insights and interdisciplinary solution.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187327] Neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized as pain arising from lesions of the somatosensory nervous system. However, NP-like features have been found in several chronic secondary musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions in the absence of detectable lesion or damage to the somatosensory pathways. Emerging evidence has demonstrated associations between NP-like symptoms and altered neural activity within brain regions implicated in sensory perception and affective-emotional processing of pain with consistent findings of abnormal activity in the right insula (RIns) cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG-NF) is a brain-computer interface biofeedback technique that allows individuals to self-regulate the real-time cortical brain activities of the regions of interest. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of a novel EEG-NF intervention designed to simultaneously downtrain activity in the RIns and dACC in individuals with a chronic secondary MSK pain condition exhibiting NP-like features. In addition, this study will conduct secondary exploratory analyses to investigate EEG-derived neuronal changes and their associations with clinical and experimental pain outcomes following the EEG-NF training. We will design a single-arm, open-label, pilot-feasibility trial. We will recruit adults aged 35-75 years with a score of ≥19 using the PainDETECT questionnaire and an average pain score of ≥4 on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the last 3 months, with a minimum pain duration of 3 months, to receive active EEG-NF training. Participants will receive auditory feedback as a reward for achieving a predetermined activity threshold of the RIns and dACC. Primary outcomes will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and safety using both self-reported questionnaires and monitoring data. Collected data will be summarized descriptively, with mean (SD) reported where appropriate. Secondary outcomes will include EEG parameters, self-reported measures, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing. An exploratory within-group pre-post statistical comparison will be conducted for all secondary outcome measures, and correlation analysis will be performed to explore relationships between EEG measures, self-reported outcomes, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing measures. This study has received approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Participant recruitment began in April 2025 and is ongoing. As of October 2025, data collection has been completed, with a total of 5 participants enrolled, all of whom have completed the study to date. We expect to complete the study in March 2026. This study will generate data on feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary data to inform a fully powered effectiveness clinical trial. The results and data generated will inform the design and sample size calculation for a fully powered randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of EEG-NF in targeting NP-like features in individuals with chronic MSK pain.

[PMID: 41187320] Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are thousands of toxic synthetic chemicals that bioaccumulate and persist in the environment. They are known to cause immunotoxicity, organ damage, endocrine disruption, and reproductive impairments in wildlife such as sea otters (Enhydra lutris). However, there is limited information on the distribution of these chemicals across the northeastern Pacific, and baseline data are missing to assess their potential impacts on sea otters in regions such as British Columbia (BC), Canada. We analyzed liver (n = 11) and skeletal muscle samples (n = 5) from 11 deceased sea otters from coastal BC using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency method 1633 with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. We found 8 of the 40 tested PFAS were present in all sampled sea otters, although concentrations of each PFAS varied between individuals. Sea otter livers contained more PFAS compounds at higher total average concentrations than skeletal muscle (i.e., 8 PFAS totaling 10.38 ng/g wet wt vs. 1 PFAS totaling 0.38 ng/g wet wt). Only perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) was identified in both liver and muscle tissues, whereas the remaining 7 PFAS were unique to the liver. The three PFAS that dominated the liver PFAS composition (perfluorononanoic acid, PFOSA, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) accounted for 84% of the contaminant load in the livers. Geographically, PFAS concentrations were more than three times higher on average in sea otters recovered near major cities and shipping routes. Identifying the contaminants accumulating in sea otters provides insights into the health threats confronted by recovering sea otter populations. Our study also establishes baseline PFAS contamination levels in BC sea otters, which can be used to monitor and regulate the presence of PFAS on marine environments in western Canada.

[PMID: 41187309] Cardiovascular disorders are closely linked to metabolic syndrome and remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, despite advances in early detection and treatment. Adipokines, cardiokines, and myokines play critical roles in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis. In this study, we measured serum levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), irisin, and adiponectin in 243 male patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. We investigated the associations of these biomarkers with coronary artery disease (CAD) and their correlation with metabolic syndrome status. FSTL1 levels were predicted using a Particle Swarm Optimization-enhanced Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (PSO-ANFIS) based on artificial intelligence. Patients with CAD exhibited significantly lower FABP4 levels (p<0.0001), and low FABP4 levels emerged as an independent predictor of CAD in logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 0.903, 95% CI 0.825-0.987, p=0.025). The combination of adiponectin, FSTL1, and irisin as a biomarker strategy demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96). Both FSTL1 and adiponectin independently correlated with metabolic syndrome (p<0.001, odds ratio 1.039, 95% CI 1.025-1.054; p<0.001, odds ratio 0.979, 95% CI 0.971-0.988, respectively). The prediction of FSTL1 levels using PSO-ANFIS supports the concept of harmonization among metabolic messengers. These findings underscore the potential of FABP4 and FSTL1 as valuable biomarkers for diagnosing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, thereby facilitating personalized interventions targeting organokine pathways.

[PMID: 41187287] A growing body of evidence has identified that people's physical health could influence self-rated health and quality of life (QoL). However, only focusing on physical health is not adequate for the well-being of older adults. Studies focusing on the impact of psychological well-being on self-rated health and QoL are still rare. This study aimed to identify the mediating effect of depression on the association between psychological well-being and self-rated health and QoL to comprehensively understand the relationship between them. We used a cross-sectional study design and secondary data analysis from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey of 2017 to 2018. Path analysis was applied to examine the research questions. A large sample of 8839 older adults was included. Among them, more positive affect was found among those who were younger and had more years of schooling, higher household income, greater social security and social insurance, lower depression levels, and higher self-rated health levels. Depression had a partial mediation effect of psychological well-being on self-rated health and QoL, which explained 36% of the total variance (R2=0.36). In addition, psychological well-being had a statistically significant direct effect on self-rated health and QoL (β=0.290; P<.001). Our results indicate that psychological well-being had both direct and indirect effects on self-rated health and QoL. Depression was an important mediator that regulated the effect pathway in older adults.

[PMID: 41187286] Deep-blue perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on reduced-dimensional perovskites (RDPs) have suffered from unbalanced charge injections and uncontrolled crystallization kinetics processes, impeding the realization of high-performance PeLEDs. In this work, an interfacial chemical molecular bridge was implemented between the RDP and poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) hole transporting layer to engineer the interfacial electrical environment. The results reveal that the bridging molecule exhibits a strong interface reaction with PVK, facilitating hole injection and improving energy level alignment. Simultaneously, the molecular bridge regulates RDP crystallization dynamics, which inhibits the formation of halide clusters as well as small-<i>n</i> phases and improves defect renovation at the buried interface. As a result, the optimized RDP films exhibit a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 71.69% at 447 nm. The modified PeLEDs deliver an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.48%, along with spectrally stable deep-blue electroluminescence.

[PMID: 41187282] Opioid overdose is a global public health emergency, with the United States experiencing high rates of morbidity and mortality due to prescription and illicit opioid use. Traditional public health monitoring systems often fail to provide real-time insights, limiting their capacity for early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, especially Reddit, offer a promising alternative for timely toxicovigilance due to the abundance of user-generated, real-time content. This study aimed to explore the use of Reddit as a real-time, high-volume source for toxicovigilance and develop an automated system that can classify and analyze opioid-related social media posts to detect behavioral patterns and monitor the evolution of public discourse on opioid use. To investigate evolving social media discourse around opioid use, we collected a large-scale dataset from Reddit spanning 6 years, from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2023. Using a comprehensive opioid lexicon-including formal drug names, street slang, common misspellings, and abbreviations-we filtered relevant posts for further analysis. A subset of these data was manually annotated according to well-defined annotation guidelines into 4 categories: self-misuse, external misuse, information, and unrelated, with distributions of 37.21%, 27.25%, 27.57%, and 7.97%, respectively. To automate the classification of opioid-related chatter, we developed a robust natural language processing pipeline leveraging classical machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and transformer-based architecture, and fine-tuned a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM; OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo). In the final stage, the trained LLM was deployed on an unlabeled dataset comprising 74,975 additional Reddit chatter posts. This enabled a detailed temporal analysis of opioid-related discussions, aligned with 6 years of opioid-related death records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For this study, self-misuse and external misuse were merged into a misuse category for direct comparison with the CDC's mortality data, examining whether trends in social media discourse on opioid misuse reflect patterns in real-world mortality statistics. The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 0.93, outperforming the baseline (random forest 0.85) by representing a performance improvement of 9.14% over the machine learning model. The temporal analysis of the unlabeled data revealed evolving trends in opioid-related discussions, indicating shifts in user behavior and overdose-related chatter over time. To quantify this relationship, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between misuse-related posts and CDC death records (r=0.854). This correlation was statistically significant (P<.001), indicating a strong positive relationship between web-based discussions and CDC mortality data. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating advanced natural language processing techniques and LLMs with social media data to support real-time public health surveillance. Reddit provides a valuable platform for identifying emerging trends in opioid use and overdose risk. The proposed system offers a proactive tool for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to better understand and respond to the opioid crisis.",10

We discovered that Egr2 and/or Egr3 directly induced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, inhibitors of STAT1 and STAT3, and also blocked the function of Batf, an AP-1 inhibitor, in B and T cells. Thus, Egr2 and Egr3 regulate B and T cell function in adaptive immune responses and homeostasis by promoting antigen receptor signaling and controlling inflammation.

[PMID: 41187309] Cardiovascular disorders are closely linked to metabolic syndrome and remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, despite advances in early detection and treatment. Adipokines, cardiokines, and myokines play critical roles in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis. In this study, we measured serum levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), irisin, and adiponectin in 243 male patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. We investigated the associations of these biomarkers with coronary artery disease (CAD) and their correlation with metabolic syndrome status. FSTL1 levels were predicted using a Particle Swarm Optimization-enhanced Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (PSO-ANFIS) based on artificial intelligence. Patients with CAD exhibited significantly lower FABP4 levels (p<0.0001), and low FABP4 levels emerged as an independent predictor of CAD in logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 0.903, 95% CI 0.825-0.987, p=0.025). The combination of adiponectin, FSTL1, and irisin as a biomarker strategy demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96). Both FSTL1 and adiponectin independently correlated with metabolic syndrome (p<0.001, odds ratio 1.039, 95% CI 1.025-1.054; p<0.001, odds ratio 0.979, 95% CI 0.971-0.988, respectively). The prediction of FSTL1 levels using PSO-ANFIS supports the concept of harmonization among metabolic messengers. These findings underscore the potential of FABP4 and FSTL1 as valuable biomarkers for diagnosing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, thereby facilitating personalized interventions targeting organokine pathways.

[PMID: 41187176] Self-pacing treadmills provide advantages for assessing locomotion such as having a controlled environment and ability to accurately collect prolonged data, but the variable sounds from the treadmill belt motors when changing speed could provide artificial sensory feedback to walkers that may influence their gait while on the self-pacing treadmill. We hypothesized that temporal measures of gait on a proportionally-controlled self-pacing treadmill would be significantly different between when sound is present vs removed. Participants (n = 31) walked under two different conditions for five-minute periods each on the self-pacing treadmill: one without headphones, and the other with noise-cancelling headphones playing brown noise to mask the treadmill motor sounds. Mixed effects models were used to assess the impact of condition on temporal gait patterns. A custom accelerometer-based algorithm was created to detect gait events while on the treadmill. Significant differences were found in the average values of swing time, step time, and gait speed between the treadmill conditions. These differences between the two treadmill conditions suggest that self-pacing treadmill walkers may utilize the variable belt motor sounds available to them. Given the potential incorporation of auditory feedback for motor planning when walking on the self-pacing treadmill, researchers should consider belt motor sounds as a potential factor that affects gait patterns.

[PMID: 41187128] The autonomic nervous system (ANS) dynamically regulates the internal environment to maintain homeostasis. The ANS exhibits some forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and plastic changes in neurotransmitter distribution, both of which may contribute to autonomic function. Dysautonomia refers to an abnormality in the function of the ANS, with an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Dysautonomia has been reported in conditions such as stress, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and premature death. In MS, the signs of dysautonomia include elevated plasma norepinephrine levels and increased arterial blood pressure. In this study, we characterized the effect of a high-sucrose diet (HSD) on synaptic plasticity in sympathetic ganglia of the rat by measuring LTP expression in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and analyzing the expression of acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA, as well as their balance of colocalization/segregation in ganglionic nerve terminals. The HSD consists of adding 30% sucrose to drinking water, which is an accepted model of MS. We observed an impairment in LTP expression, along with a decrease in ACh presence and a reduction in its segregation from GABA. These findings suggest the emergence of an inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission and plasticity within the SCG. We propose that dysautonomia associated with MS might involve changes in sympathetic activity, at least at the level of ganglionic cholinergic transmission. These results may help to improve our understanding of autonomic dysfunction in the context of this metabolic disorder.

[PMID: 41187066] Mice often serve as valuable surrogate models for studying human reproduction. This study provides a single-cell transcriptomic profile of mouse immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout pregnancy and assesses the similarities and differences between these immune cells and human decidual immune cells. Homeostasis of the immune microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface is essential for pregnancy. Immune cell heterogeneity at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnant mice remains understudied. Here, we perform in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analysis with 120,238 maternal-fetal single cells of mice from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E18.5 and in vitro experiments to establish an immune cell atlas. Macrophages constitute the largest population, with some subsets resembling human counterparts, and the number of Ccr2 + macrophages in the decidua increases as pregnancy progresses. Neutrophils constitute the second largest population, and Ifit1 + N2 neutrophils are localized close to the implantation site during early pregnancy. Three NK cell subsets were identified, including the previously reported NK1.1 - subset. In combination with in vitro experiments, the presence of T and B cells within the decidua was validated. Our work profiles a comprehensive immune cell atlas of the mouse maternal-fetal interface, offering a valuable reference for further investigations.

[PMID: 41187060] Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) represent a promising therapeutic resource, yet their immunometabolic regulation remains poorly defined. Here, we reveal a tunneling nanotube (TNT)-mediated communication mechanism between ADSCs and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) that maintains metabolic homeostasis during pregnancy. Using gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mouse models combined with live-cell imaging, scanning electron microscope, and multi-omics approaches, we demonstrate that mitochondrial transfer from ADSCs to ATMs via TNTs sustains ATM metabolic fitness. This process is governed by the WNT5A-RhoA-ROCK1 axis and becomes impaired under metabolic stress, driving ATMs inflammatory polarization and insulin resistance. Importantly, in situ ADSC administration restores mitochondrial transfer and improves metabolic parameters in GDM mice. Collectively, our work establishes TNT-mediated organelle sharing as a fundamental mechanism of stem cell-immune interaction and demonstrates that ADSC-based therapy represents a promising strategy for GDM by reprogramming the metabolism of immune cells.

[PMID: 41187059] The intestinal mucus layer produced by goblet cells is a critical component of innate immunity. The key host factors and regulatory mechanisms controlling goblet cell function in mucus layer formation remain poorly understood. This study identifies a function for the microprotein FXYD domain-containing transport regulator 3 (FXYD3) in goblet cells in regulating mucus layer formation to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Deficiency of FXYD3 in mouse intestinal epithelial cells results in a damaged mucus barrier, leading to dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to colitis. Mechanistically, FXYD3 interacts with endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase SERCA2 to enhance its pump activity. FXYD3 deficiency causes defects in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and mucin glycosylation, impairing mucus layer integrity. Furthermore, metabolites of gut microbiota, propionate, and butyrate promote FXYD3 expression. In ulcerative colitis patients, FXYD3 expression is significantly downregulated and correlates with disease severity. These findings indicate FXYD3 is a key mediator of host-microbiota interactions for intestinal health.

[PMID: 41186900] Achieving high-quality immune reconstitution (IR) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is directly associated with the patient's ability to resist infections, prevent tumor relapses, and suppress graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The status of CD4 + T cells is critical for reconstituting adaptive immunity after transplantation; however, the patterns of reconstitution and their influencing factors remain unclear. This retrospective cohort study involved 164 patients who underwent myeloablative allo-HSCT from April 2016 to May 2023. Based on the early post-transplantation CD4 + T cell counts, the cohort was divided into two groups: 73 patients with high-quality IR (HIR) and 34 patients with low-quality IR (LIR). LIR was associated with an increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation following transplantation. Plasma EBV viral load was monitored weekly using quantitative PCR for the first 100 days post-transplantation. The LIR group had a higher viral load at the time of the first EBV reactivation and a significantly earlier first reactivation compared to the HIR group. No significant differences were observed in overall survival, GVHD incidence, or relapse rates between the groups. A CD4 + T cell count of < 60 cells/μL within 30 days post-transplantation was associated with a higher incidence of EBV viremia compared to the control group. These findings suggest that early CD4 + T cell counts may serve as a predictive marker for post-transplant EBV infection.

[PMID: 41186896] Lung cancer is associated with one of the highest cancer-related mortality rates and is the second most prevalent cancer worldwide. Diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer has different challenges as in most cases, and it is often diagnosed late when metastatic spread is widely disseminated. The development of chemo- and radioresistance of lung cancer, as well as a lack of specific treatment, has resulted in a very high mortality and morbidity. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a group of RNAs with a wide spectrum of functions required for homeostasis. These RNAs modulate the expression of proteins posttranslationally and control the cell phenotype. Studies have shown that these RNAs could act as both oncogene and oncosuppressor, and due to their great therapeutic and diagnostic potential, recent studies have also focused on their use as biomarkers for early detection of cancers. Understanding the current findings in this field would help scientists to have an overview about different ncRNAs and their role in lung cancer progression. This chapter explores the landscape of ncRNA research related to lung cancer, highlighting the potential for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

[PMID: 41186825] The autophagy-related structures, the size of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisterns, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins were assessed by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from mice with B16 skin melanoma after administration of autophagy inducer (rapamycin) or ER stress inducer (brefeldin A). Brefeldin A stimulated significant ER stress in mouse skin melanoma cells, but rapamycin contributed to the maintenance of cell homeostasis by inducing autophagy, which was confirmed by the presence of autophagy-related structures and significantly smaller sizes of the rough ER cisterns in the group of mice receiving both rapamycin and brefeldin A. Brefeldin A-induced ER stress triggered apoptosis of tumor cells. Moreover, simultaneous stimulation of autophagy and ER stress in tumor cells promoted cytoprotective selective autophagy (reticulophagy) aimed at resolving ER stress, which may be a mechanism underlying the development of chemoresistance in skin melanoma.",10

Functional interactions between CB1R and mu-opioid receptors (MOR) in analgesia have been reported. This study investigated CB1R occupancy and neuronal activation in non-human primate brains following acute administration of a CB1R agonist (CP55,940), an antagonist/inverse-agonist (rimonabant), an MOR agonist (morphine) using simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). [<sup>11</sup>C]OMAR, a CB1R-selective radiotracer, PET scans were acquired using bolus or bolus-plus-infusion protocols. Rimonabant (1, 3 mg/kg, <i>n</i> = 1 for each) reduced [<sup>11</sup>C]OMAR non-displaceable binding potential by 25%-40% in CB1R-rich regions. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo demonstration of CB1R occupancy by the agonist CP55,940 (0.05 mg/kg, <i>n</i> = 2), which displaced 15%-30% of [<sup>11</sup>C]OMAR volume of distribution (V<sub>T</sub>) in CB1R-rich regions. Although there was no clear dose-response relationship, CP55,940 increased cerebral blood volume (CBV), whereas rimonabant caused a biphasic response. Morphine administration (1 mg/kg, <i>n</i> = 2) reduced CBV in MOR-rich areas and modestly increased [<sup>11</sup>C]OMAR V<sub>T</sub>, suggesting a potential indirect modulation of CB1R availability. Given the small sample size and variability close to test-retest levels, these preliminary findings should be interpreted with caution.

[PMID: 41185002] Exposure to trauma is widespread and has significant implications for health outcomes and healthcare delivery. Comprehensive Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) recognizes the prevalence and impact of trauma and seeks to create policies, practices, and environments grounded in safety, trust, collaboration, choice, and empowerment. University Health, a large academic medical center in San Antonio, Texas, launched a comprehensive initiative to embed TIC principles system-wide, positioning itself as both an educator and a provider of trauma-informed practices. Guided by the 10 key development areas defined by the Institute on Trauma and Trauma-Informed Care (ITTIC), University Health initiated its comprehensive TIC transformation in 2020. The organization established an internal Trauma-Informed Care Workgroup, provided staff and community training, integrated TIC into organizational policies and procedures, created peer support and wellness initiatives, and implemented trauma screening and treatment protocols. Evaluation methods included biennial administration of the TICS-10 (Trauma-Informed Climate Scale) and qualitative feedback from Schwartz Rounds participants. Over five years, University Health trained more than 130 TIC Advocates, updated over 90 policies with trauma-informed language, and launched programs supporting staff well-being and patient-centered care. In 2024, University Health became the first major health system in Bexar County to earn local Level 1 TIC certification. TICS-10 scores improved from 34.1 (low) in 2020 to 35.0 (moderate) in 2024, indicating progress in creating a trauma-informed work environment. Schwartz Rounds sentiment analysis showed 71% of comments were positive, highlighting increased empathy, connection, and validation among staff members. University Health's experience demonstrates that comprehensive, system-wide trauma-informed transformation is achievable in large healthcare settings. Through leadership support, cross-departmental collaboration, and intentional policy and practice change, TIC principles were embedded into organizational culture. An impartial certification process and program evaluation data validated the impact of the initiative, although continued efforts are needed to assess long-term outcomes on patient care and staff well-being. This case study offers a replicable model for other health systems pursuing trauma-informed organizational change.

[PMID: 41184319] Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Recently the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) was identified as a receptor for HAstV, however the molecular basis for the FcRn-HAstV interaction remained unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of FcRn bound to the HAstV capsid spike domain at 3.4 angstroms resolution. We show that all classical HAstV spikes bind to FcRn and we identify three conserved HAstV spike residues that mediate binding to FcRn. Using competition binding assays, we show that the HAstV spike competes with IgG for binding to FcRn. Additionally, we demonstrate that the FcRn inhibitor, nipocalimab, and anti-HAstV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies block HAstV spike binding to FcRn, revealing their neutralization mechanisms and supporting their therapeutic potential. Overall, our findings illuminate a crucial interaction in the HAstV life cycle, which may help to inform the development of a HAstV vaccine and antibody therapies.

[PMID: 41184296] Influenza is a global health concern, causing over 300,000 deaths worldwide annually. Current vaccines and natural infection mainly elicit antibodies against the variable head domain of the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. While these antibodies are highly neutralizing, the head domain constantly mutates due to selective pressure, causing the immune response to be strain-specific. Targeting the conserved HA stalk domain, however, has been shown to be a promising approach for a broadly protective vaccine. We previously demonstrated that presenting HA in an inverted orientation on virus-like particles (VLPs) significantly enhanced the induction of stalk-directed, cross-reactive antibodies compared to HA presented in a regular orientation. Here, we evaluated the protective efficacy of the inverted HA vaccine (VLP-HA<sub>inv</sub>) in mice against homologous, heterologous, and heterosubtypic influenza A virus challenges. VLP-HA<sub>inv</sub> vaccination in mice provided complete protection against homologous and heterologous H1N1 challenges as well as partial protection against a heterosubtypic challenge with bovine H5N1.

[PMID: 41184282] Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes febrile illness and acute or chronic arthritis. Most therapeutics are still in the pre-clinical stage. In this study, we report the isolation of two neutralizing antibodies, C34 and C37, from a convalescent patient and investigate their mechanisms of action. Both C34 and C37 exhibit high neutralizing activities in vitro and demonstrate protective effects against CHIKV in a female mouse model. Our functional and structural studies reveal a mechanism that inhibits multiple stages of the virus infection cycle. Both antibodies bind with high affinity to an epitope spanning E2, E1, and the connecting β-strands, facilitating intra- and inter-virion crosslinking. Cryo-EM structures additionally identify a minor patch located beneath the E3 binding site on E2, which is allosterically exposed upon E3 dissociation during virus maturation. Functional and structural data further suggest that binding to the CHIKV receptor, Mxra8, is obstructed due to a clash between the antibodies and the stalk region of Mxra8. Our results highlight the potential of antibody-based therapeutics against CHIKV and elucidate the mechanisms of monoclonal antibody protection.

[PMID: 41183201] We describe the production and use of nanobody drug conjugates that comprise of VHH<sub>kappa</sub>, a nanobody that recognizes mouse immunoglobulin kappa light chains, and one or more copies of the small molecule influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor, zanamivir. Such compounds achieve half-life extension of zanamivir, while recruiting polyclonal immunoglobulins of all isotypes regardless of specificity to infected cells for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Since the influenza A virus (IAV) NA is a tetramer, we produced VHH<sub>kappa</sub> adducts with 1, 2, or 4 zanamivir molecules attached in a site-specific manner, to allow multivalent engagement of NA. Administration of a VHH<sub>kappa</sub> adduct modified with 4 zanamivir molecules (VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan<sub>4</sub>) was ~10-fold more potent in protection against infection with IAV than VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan carrying only a single zanamivir molecule. VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan<sub>4</sub> can be given intranasally to confer full protection against a lethal IAV challenge. The neutralizing antibody titers in the respiratory mucosa and in the circulation, as well as the serum IgG antibody response against the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein, are higher in VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan<sub>4</sub> treated mice that survived the lethal challenge than in controls infected with a sublethal dose of virus. VHH<sub>kappa</sub>-Zan<sub>4</sub> affords protection even when given intranasally weeks prior to a challenge with a lethal dose of IAV. This type of adduct can therefore be applied prophylactically and therapeutically and does not require prior immunization for protection against a lethal dose of IAV.

[PMID: 41183200] Development of tolerogenic, antigen-specific immunotherapies could overcome limitations of existing treatments for inflammatory autoimmune diseases by achieving potent, durable remission without impacting healthy immune surveillance. Here, we deliver diffusion-limited polymer depots to lymph nodes to locally guide T cell fates for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks myelin. In preclinical MS models, depots loaded with myelin self-antigen and tolerizing cues mediate localized retention of activated CD4 T cells, promote myelin-specific regulatory T cells, and reshape inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) to eliminate lesions. Selective disease reversal is achieved with a single treatment that induces long-lasting remission without hindering healthy responses to vaccine challenge with foreign antigen. Furthermore, depots offer favorable chemistry and manufacturing control features and are well tolerated in non-human primates. This work supports a clinically feasible concept for inducing safe, effective, antigen-specific tolerance without systemic or repeated dosing.

[PMID: 41181601] Tuberculosis (TB) remains the primary cause of death due to infectious disease in the world. TB, while treatable, requires an extended course of multiple antibiotics, taking 6-9 months, and many antibiotic regimens have deleterious side effects. Treatment is complicated by co-infection, emerging drug resistance, and compliance issues; accordingly, the identification of new and optimal regimens has been a recent focus. Rodent models of TB (e.g., mouse, rabbit) do not mimic some severe pathologies well, while nonhuman primate models are costly. Several computational and <i>in vitro</i> tools have been developed to explore drug regimen design and efficacy for TB, each providing insight into human disease dynamics. Here we briefly review existing tools and introduce a novel, integrated approach combining <i>in vitro</i> predictions of drug pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug-drug interactions with a granuloma-scale computational model (<i>GranSim</i>). Our method captures <i>in vivo</i> dynamics to test how well systematic <i>in vitro</i> data predict granuloma-scale outcomes such as CFU burden and sterilization time. To evaluate <i>in vitro</i> measurements under various growth conditions and to compare to clinical and experimental datasets, we simulated five well-known regimens in our pipeline: HRZM, BPaMZ, RMZE, BPaL and HRZE. We find that <i>in vitro</i> measurements of antibiotic regimen pharmacodynamics under specific growth conditions can be used to simulate virtual granulomas consistent with low-burden human and primate granulomas. This work provides a novel tool that can be used to quickly and efficiently evaluate drug regimens for TB.

[PMID: 41180303] Ageing contributes to the onset of various diseases. It is accompanied by malfunctioning and deterioration of the body systems. Identifying the biomarkers for the prediction, diagnosis, management, or prognosis of ageing and biological ageing was the aim of this study. The peptide identification was done by analysing the conserved sequences in a comprehensive multiple alignment and domain annotation of the small peptide of methyl jasmonate esterase 1 (<i>MJE1</i>) present in the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> (wine grape). The discovery of biomarkers was done by annotating the RNA-Seq dataset that comprehensively sequenced the human Achilles tendon transcriptome in young and older people to identify differentially expressed genes. Followed by molecular docking, ADMET and protein-protein interactions studies. The molecular docking was performed by docking the active peptide of <i>MJE1</i> with the human complement factor H (<i>CFH</i>) identified in the RNA-Seq data analysis. The sequenced alignment analysis indicated high similarity (~99%) of <i>MJE1</i> protein in the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> (wine grape), as well as some other set of plant species that also encode a gene for <i>MJE1</i>. The pharmacokinetics and ADMET properties of MJE1 revealed a molecular weight of 224.30 g/mol and polar surface area measured at 43.37 Å<sup>2</sup>, suggesting its adherence to Lipinski's rules of for drug likeliness; moreover, data supported MJE1 interactions with mostly nuclear receptors. Of all the annotated biomarkers in the RNA-Seq dataset analysed in this study, we prioritised the <i>CFH</i> for the robust data supporting its activities in ageing research and the availability of its crystalline structured. The molecular docking of MJE1 selected peptide with <i>CFH</i> surface identified conformational changes enacted by the surface and orientation interactions with four amino acid residues (CYS 1167, THR 1227, TRP 2 and PHE 10) of the protein. By using computational techniques to investigate the plausible anti-ageing potential of the small peptide of <i>MJE1</i> present in the <i>Vitis vinifera,</i> we identified a complex interaction between <i>MJE1</i> and <i>CFH</i>. This finding necessitates further investigation in mouse, zebrafish or non-human primate model towards the understanding of anti-ageing therapy.

[PMID: 41177519] Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) have been proposed as biomarkers for stratifying BKPyV replication risk, while TTV viral load is recognized as a global immunomarker in kidney transplantation. This study investigates their combined utility to improve BKPyV DNAemia risk assessment in 187 patients within 12 months post-transplant (M12). BKPyV DNAemia occurred in 19% of recipients. Donor seronegativity was protective, whereas in case of seropositive donor, replication risk varied according to recipient NAb titers. Indeed, patients with low NAbs faced a high risk of BKPyV DNAemia regardless of TTV load, while in those with high NAbs, replication was influenced by TTV load at M1. These findings provide a deeper understanding of BKPyV infection in kidney transplant recipients. In patients with low humoral immunity, the risk of early replication is high, whereas in those with adequate humoral immunity, replication appears to be primarily driven by the overall burden of immunosuppression. Donor status and cold ischemia time were also associated with BKPyV DNAemia, suggesting also an influence of transplant characteristics and related injury. Our findings support a multifactorial BKPyV risk assessment integrating immune markers to enable personalized prevention and potentially reduce BKPyV risk.",10
Elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels are associated with mortality.,cell-free mitochondrial DNA AND elevated levels AND mortality AND risk factors,"37221566,33444289,41187382,41187363,41187362,41187354,41187351,41187339,41187332,41187329","[PMID: 37221566] Dementia and frailty are common age-related syndromes often linked to chronic inflammation. Identifying the biological factors and pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation is crucial for developing new therapeutic targets. Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) has been proposed as an immune stimulator and potential predictor of mortality in acute illnesses. Dementia and frailty are both associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired cellular energetics, and cell death. The size and abundance of ccf-mtDNA fragments may indicate the mechanism of cell death: long fragments typically result from necrosis, while short fragments arise from apoptosis. We hypothesize that increased levels of necrosis-associated long ccf-mtDNA fragments and inflammatory markers in serum are linked to declines in cognitive and physical function, as well as increased mortality risk. Our study of 672 community-dwelling older adults revealed that inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein, soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 [sTNFR1], and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) positively correlated with ccf-mtDNA levels in serum. Although cross-sectional analysis revealed no significant associations between short and long ccf-mtDNA fragments, longitudinal analysis demonstrated a connection between higher long ccf-mtDNA fragments (necrosis-associated) and worsening composite gait scores over time. Additionally, increased mortality risk was observed only in individuals with elevated sTNFR1 levels. In a community dwelling cohort of older adults, there are cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between ccf-mtDNA and sTNFR1 with impaired physical and cognitive function and increased hazard of death. This work suggests a role for long ccf-mtDNA as a blood-based marker predictive of future physical decline.

[PMID: 33444289] BackgroundMitochondrial DNA (MT-DNA) are intrinsically inflammatory nucleic acids released by damaged solid organs. Whether circulating cell-free MT-DNA quantitation could be used to predict the risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes remains undetermined.MethodsWe measured circulating MT-DNA levels in prospectively collected, cell-free plasma samples from 97 subjects with COVID-19 at hospital presentation. Our primary outcome was mortality. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, vasopressor, and renal replacement therapy requirements were secondary outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis determined whether MT-DNA levels were independent of other reported COVID-19 risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve assessments were used to compare MT-DNA levels with established and emerging inflammatory markers of COVID-19.ResultsCirculating MT-DNA levels were highly elevated in patients who eventually died or required ICU admission, intubation, vasopressor use, or renal replacement therapy. Multivariate regression revealed that high circulating MT-DNA was an independent risk factor for these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. We also found that circulating MT-DNA levels had a similar or superior area under the curve when compared against clinically established measures of inflammation and emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19 therapy.ConclusionThese results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels are a potential early indicator for poor COVID-19 outcomes.FundingWashington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences COVID-19 Research Program and Washington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences (ICTS) NIH grant UL1TR002345.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187363] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains a major respiratory pathogen of economic concern in the poultry industry. This study investigated the farm-level prevalence of IBV and evaluated associated risk factors in northern Vietnam by a cross-sectional study from June 2022 to June 2024. A total of 69 poultry farms were randomly selected across nine provinces, and pooled tracheal swab samples were purposively collected for IBV detection using RT-qPCR. The overall IBV farm-level prevalence was 34.78 % (95 % CI:23.71-47.21 %). Although no statistically significant differences were found across provinces, production types, age groups, or flock sizes, IBV was detected in all subgroups, indicating widespread circulation of the virus. A total of 22 potential risk factors were initially assessed using univariate logistic regression. Of these, six variables with P < 0.1, including farm size, number of poultry houses, presence of multiple age groups, vaccination at day-old, frequency of disinfection before chick placement, and proximity to live bird markets and residential areas, were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model retained two independent predictors: performing more than one disinfection before chick placement (P = 0.035), and administration of a live IB vaccine at one day of age (P = 0.006), both of which were significantly associated with reduced the odds of IBV infection at the farm level. These findings suggest that strategic vaccination and careful calibration of disinfection protocols are critical to minimizing IBV transmission at the farm level.

[PMID: 41187362] The risk of a foreign animal disease coming into the United States and threatening the swine industry necessitates the need for enhanced biosecurity plans to mitigate risks to premises. Although most biosecurity information is aimed and created for larger producers and isn't appropriate for smaller producers, such as swine exhibitors. Swine exhibitors are a niche group who raise swine differently than large producers and travel extensively with their animals. This study sought out to; develop a SPS plan template adapted from the SPS framework that would be suitable for swine exhibitors' biosecurity features; describe basic demographics and existence of biosecurity plan (and their features) for the target population; and investigate the association between having a previous biosecurity plan on site and demographic factors (number of pigs, type of housing, presence of other animal species in the premise and geographical region) as well as potential exposure to feral swine under their current housing conditions. These objectives were accomplished by attending twelve swine exhibitions within a year and a half to assist 161 individuals in the creation of personalized biosecurity plans for their premises, while obtaining additional study data. This study found no significant relationship between demographic factors and previously having a biosecurity plan, but that only 31.8 % of participants had previous biosecurity plans on their premise. However, swine exhibitors with existing biosecurity plans had more than 3-fold higher odds of acknowledging housing conditions with potential of feral swine contact compared to swine exhibitors without preexisting biosecurity plans. These findings indicate the need for additional efforts to assist swine exhibitors in creating biosecurity plans at shows across the United States.

[PMID: 41187354] In recent years, atmospheric pollution has been increasing day by day due to the rapid growth of industrialization, urbanization and motor vehicles. As a result, a large number of pollutants containing harmful and toxic gases like NO2, NH3, H2, H2S and C3H6O etc. are being released into the environment. This detrimental increase can cause adverse effects on human life, necessitating monitoring and safety measures. Gas sensors play a crucial role in this regard by monitoring and alerting when pollutant levels exceed permissible limits. Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors have gained much popularity due to their good stability, tunable chemical properties, simple fabrication process and cost effectiveness. SnO2 is the most widely used MOS material for detecting various toxic and hazardous gases, owing to its excellent physical and chemical properties, high reliability and short adsorption and desorption times. In this review, we elevated the role of SnO2 in detecting various toxic and hazardous gases and highlighting different synthesis methods with various structural and morphological modifications are summarized. By reviewing the latest advancements, this paper proposes several future research directions for SnO2-based gas sensors.

[PMID: 41187351] Epidemiological studies of large groups of nuclear industry workers offer a significant opportunity to increase our understanding of the long-term effects on health of the protracted accumulation of dose received at a low dose rate from many discrete exposures to ionising radiation. The effects of such extended aggregation of doses form an important part of the everyday concerns of radiological protection against low-level exposures. For more than half a century, databases of nuclear workers have been assembled, and the numbers of workers currently included in studies, together with the numbers of deaths among them that have now occurred, are capable of generating reasonably precise risk estimates that should provide meaningful comparisons with those obtained from other studies, such as of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, constructing, updating and maintaining these large databases, linking workers to occupational dose databases and to registers of deaths (and other outcomes, such as incident cancers) and their causes, and analyses of these data that endeavour to take account of other influential factors (such as smoking) are far from straightforward. A critical review of recent nuclear worker studies illustrates the difficulties in reliably interpreting reported statistical associations between rates of cancer and cumulative occupational doses because of the real possibility of distortions produced by biases, confounding and/or the interplay of radiation with other risk factors. This doesn't mean that studies of nuclear workers should be abandoned, far from it, but it does mean that appropriate effort needs to be expended on these studies before confident conclusions about the levels of risks from radiation exposure can be drawn from them. Unexpected findings should be examined in depth to gain a proper understanding of their origin, including the impact of doses from intakes of radionuclides upon dose-responses derived using doses from external sources of radiation.

[PMID: 41187339] Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is a common endemic vector-borne disease in Asia that can lead to a range of systemic complications, including the rare but potentially life-threatening manifestation of acute pancreatitis. We conducted a systematic review of all reported cases of scrub typhus-associated acute pancreatitis from 1943 to 2024 using PubMed, including English, Japanese, and Chinese literature, and analyzed a total of 14 cases, including one newly identified case at our institution. Diagnostic criteria were based on compatible clinical features, elevated pancreatic enzymes, and characteristic imaging findings. The median age of patients was 47 years (range 22-75), with 69.2% of patients being male. The most frequent clinical manifestations were fever (100%), abdominal pain (92.3%), and thrombocytopenia (30.8%). Over one-third of the patients developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or shock, and the mortality rate was 23.1%, with all fatalities occurring in patients with MODS. Most patients received doxycycline or azithromycin along with supportive care. The newly reported case presented with rapidly progressive pancreatitis requiring intensive care and multiple organ support, but the patient eventually recovered. These findings highlight that acute pancreatitis is an underrecognized yet severe complication of scrub typhus, often associated with poor outcomes when MODS is present. Clinicians in endemic regions should consider pancreatitis in the differential diagnoses when evaluating scrub typhus patients with abdominal symptoms or systemic inflammation. Prompt recognition and timely, aggressive management may improve survival and reduce complications in affected patients.

[PMID: 41187332] The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) compared with anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and its impact on the primary prevention of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Patients with non-valvular AF and high thromboembolic risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc > 2 points) were included. LAAO was compared against the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 11, 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-E, while statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.4.1. A total of 10 studies with 5,779 patients were analyzed (2,916 with LAAO and 2,863 with anticoagulation). LAAO reduced, though without statistical significance, the incidence of ischemic stroke (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09). However, it showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the overall anticoagulant group (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.80; p = 0.0004). LAAO emerges as a viable strategy to reduce mortality in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, particularly when long-term anticoagulation is not feasible. Its superiority over DOACs and comparable profile to VKAs, along with the absence of periodic INR monitoring and relevant drug interactions, make it an option that may optimize adherence and quality of life.

[PMID: 41187329] The prevalence and incidence of dementia are higher in migrants and those with low socioeconomic status (SES). Mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer a potentially scalable way to reduce dementia risk via risk factor modification. We co-designed the MIND-PRO app-an mHealth intervention targeting dementia risk factors through self-managed lifestyle changes and remote coaching-specifically designed for Dutch individuals with low SES and those with Turkish or South Asian Surinamese migration backgrounds. We focused on these migrant populations as they are the largest in the Netherlands and have the highest risk of developing dementia. In this qualitative study, we explored the needs and preferences of our target populations aged 50-75 years old at increased dementia risk by conducting semistructured interviews and focus groups. Participant feedback was used to iteratively refine and adapt a prototype intervention based on insights from prior mHealth trials. We interviewed 23 participants (median age 59, IQR 55-63 y; n=15, 65% female) and conducted two focus groups with 7 Turkish women and 13 Dutch participants with low SES. The target populations emphasized personalization features such as goal setting, self-tracking, educational material, and remote coaching. Participants highlighted the importance of social interaction and autonomy in achieving sustainable lifestyle changes. Tailoring coaching and lifestyle advice to cultural practices was deemed beneficial. Optimal mHealth interventions targeting dementia risk factors in migrants and individuals with low SES should be personalized and interactive, respect autonomy, and integrate cultural needs and preferences.",10
Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.,energy balance AND hypothalamus AND glutamate AND neurotransmission,"37507231,35501599,34654752,33441043,32719118,30618146,30390285,30310864,26370162,25716862","[PMID: 37507231] The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a functionally heterogeneous nucleus critical for systemic energy, glucose, and lipid balance. We showed previously that the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) plays essential roles regulating excitatory and inhibitory transmission in SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons of the VMH and facilitating glucose and lipid homeostasis in female mice. Although mGluR5 is also highly expressed in VMH astrocytes in the mature brain, its role there influencing central metabolic circuits is unknown. In contrast to the glucose intolerance observed only in female mice lacking mGluR5 in VMH SF1 neurons, selective depletion of mGluR5 in VMH astrocytes enhanced glucose tolerance without affecting food intake or body weight in both adult female and male mice. The improved glucose tolerance was associated with elevated glucose-stimulated insulin release. Astrocytic mGluR5 male and female mutants also exhibited reduced adipocyte size and increased sympathetic tone in gonadal white adipose tissue. Diminished excitatory drive and synaptic inputs onto VMH Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP<sup>+</sup>) neurons and reduced activity of these cells during acute hyperglycemia underlie the observed changes in glycemic control. These studies reveal an essential role of astrocytic mGluR5 in the VMH regulating the excitatory drive onto PACAP<sup>+</sup> neurons and activity of these cells facilitating glucose homeostasis in male and female mice.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal circuits within the VMH play chief roles in the regulation of whole-body metabolic homeostasis. It remains unclear how astrocytes influence neurotransmission in this region to facilitate energy and glucose balance control. Here, we explored the role of the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, using a mouse model with selective depletion of mGluR5 from VMH astrocytes. We show that astrocytic mGluR5 critically regulates the excitatory drive and activity of PACAP-expressing neurons in the VMH to control glucose homeostasis in both female and male mice. Furthermore, mGluR5 in VMH astrocytes influences adipocyte size and sympathetic tone in white adipose tissue. These studies provide novel insight toward the importance of hypothalamic astrocytes participating in central circuits regulating peripheral metabolism.

[PMID: 35501599] Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for maintaining energy and glucose balance within the central nervous system. Because the study of its metabolic actions has been limited to effects in neuronal cells, its role in other cell types within the brain remains poorly understood. Here we show that astrocytic BDNF signaling within the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) modulates neuronal activity in response to changes in energy status. This occurs via the truncated TrkB.T1 receptor. Accordingly, either fasting or central BDNF depletion enhances astrocytic synaptic glutamate clearance, thereby decreasing neuronal activity in mice. Notably, selective depletion of TrkB.T1 in VMH astrocytes blunts the effects of energy status on excitatory transmission, as well as on responses to leptin, glucose and lipids. These effects are driven by increased astrocytic invasion of excitatory synapses, enhanced glutamate reuptake and decreased neuronal activity. We thus identify BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in VMH astrocytes as an essential mechanism that participates in energy and glucose homeostasis.

[PMID: 34654752] Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are essential for reproduction, but their role in the control of energy balance and other homeostatic functions remains unclear. High-frequency firing of hypothalamic arcuate Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons releases kisspeptin into the median eminence, and neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin onto neighboring Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to generate a slow EPSP mediated by TRPC5 channels that entrains intermittent, synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. High-frequency optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also releases glutamate to excite the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and inhibit the orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons via metabotropic glutamate receptors. At the molecular level, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is critically involved in the regulation of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and neuronal excitability through its interaction with plasma membrane (PM) calcium (e.g., TRPC) channels. Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons would increase neuronal excitability and their synchronous firing, which ultimately would affect energy homeostasis. Using optogenetics in combination with whole-cell recording and GCaMP6 imaging in slices, we discovered that deletion of <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1 neurons significantly increased the amplitude and duration of the slow EPSP and augmented synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i oscillations in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Deletion of <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons amplified the actions of NKB and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD). Therefore, STIM1 appears to play a critical role in regulating synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, which ultimately affects the coordination between energy homeostasis and reproduction.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons are essential for stimulating the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and maintaining fertility. However, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons appear to be a key player in coordinating energy balance with reproduction. The regulation of calcium channels and hence calcium signaling is critically dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) calcium channels. We have conditionally deleted <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and found that it significantly increased the excitability of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD).

[PMID: 33441043] To maintain metabolic homeostasis, motivated behaviors are driven by neuronal circuits that process information encoding the animal's energy state. Such circuits likely include ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) glutamatergic neurons that project throughout the brain to drive food intake and energy expenditure. Targets of VMH glutamatergic neurons include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus that, when activated, inhibit food intake. Although an energy-state-sensitive, glutamate circuit between the VMH and POMC neurons has been previously indicated, the significance and details of this circuit have not been fully elucidated. Thus, the goal of the present work was to add to the understanding of this circuit. Using a knockout strategy, the data show that the VMH glutamate→POMC neuron circuit is important for the inhibition of food intake. Conditional deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT2) in the VMH results in increased bodyweight and increased food intake following a fast in both male and female mice. Additionally, the targeted blunting of glutamate release from the VMH resulted in an ∼32% reduction in excitatory inputs to POMC cells, suggesting that this circuit may respond to changes in energy state to affect POMC activity. Indeed, we found that glutamate release is increased at VMH-to-POMC synapses during feeding and POMC AMPA receptors switch from a calcium-permeable state to a calcium-impermeable state during fasting. Collectively, these data indicate that there is an energy-balance-sensitive VMH-to-POMC circuit conveying excitatory neuromodulation onto POMC cells at both pre- and postsynaptic levels, which may contribute to maintaining appropriate food intake and body mass.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Despite decades of research, the neurocircuitry underlying metabolic homeostasis remains incompletely understood. Specifically, the roles of amino acid transmitters, particularly glutamate, have received less attention than hormonal signals. Here, we characterize an energy-state-sensitive glutamate circuit from the ventromedial hypothalamus to anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that responds to changes in energy state at both sides of the synapse, providing novel information about how variations in metabolic state affect excitatory drive onto POMC cells.

[PMID: 32719118] The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) plays chief roles regulating energy and glucose homeostasis and is sexually dimorphic. We discovered that expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) in the VMH is regulated by caloric status in normal mice and reduced in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mutants, which are severely obese and have diminished glucose balance control. These findings led us to investigate whether mGluR5 might act downstream of BDNF to critically regulate VMH neuronal activity and metabolic function. We found that mGluR5 depletion in VMH SF1 neurons did not affect energy balance regulation. However, it significantly impaired insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, lipid metabolism, and sympathetic output in females but not in males. These sex-specific deficits are linked to reductions in intrinsic excitability and firing rate of SF1 neurons. Abnormal excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly and elevated expression of the GABAergic synthetic enzyme GAD67 also cooperate to decrease and potentiate the synaptic excitatory and inhibitory tone onto mutant SF1 neurons, respectively. Notably, these alterations arise from disrupted functional interactions of mGluR5 with estrogen receptors that switch the normally positive effects of estrogen on SF1 neuronal activity and glucose balance control to paradoxical and detrimental. The collective data inform an essential central mechanism regulating metabolic function in females and underlying the protective effects of estrogen against metabolic disease.

[PMID: 30618146] Excitatory glutamate neurons are sparse in the rostral hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), the subregion that has received the most attention in the past. In striking contrast, excitatory neurons are far more common (by a factor of 10) in the caudal ARC, an area which has received relatively little attention. These glutamate cells may play a negative role in energy balance and food intake. They can show an increase in phosphorylated Stat-3 in the presence of leptin, are electrically excited by the anorectic neuromodulator cholecystokinin, and inhibited by orexigenic neuromodulators neuropeptide Y, met-enkephalin, dynorphin and the catecholamine dopamine. The neurons project local axonal connections that excite other ARC neurons including proopiomelanocortin neurons that can play an important role in obesity. These data are consistent with models suggesting that the ARC glutamatergic neurons may play both a rapid and a slower role in acting as anorectic neurons in CNS control of food intake and energy homeostasis. Here we interrogate a unique class of excitatory neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) that utilizes glutamate as a fast neurotransmitter using mice expressing GFP under control of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT2) promoter. These neurons show a unique distribution, synaptic characterization, cellular physiology and response to neuropeptides involved in energy homeostasis. Although apparently not previously appreciated, the caudal ARC showed a far greater density of vGluT2 cells than the rostral ARC, as seen in transgenic vGluT2-GFP mice and mRNA analysis. After food deprivation, leptin induced an increase in phosphorylated Stat-3 in vGluT2-positive neurons, indicating a response to hormonal cues of energy state. Based on whole-cell recording electrophysiology in brain slices, vGluT2 neurons were spontaneously active with a spike frequency around 2 Hz. vGluT2 cells were responsive to a number of neuropeptides related to energy homeostasis; they were excited by the anorectic peptide cholecystokinin, but inhibited by orexigenic neuropeptide Y, dynorphin and met-enkephalin, consistent with an anorexic role in energy homeostasis. Dopamine, associated with the hedonic aspect of enhancing food intake, inhibited vGluT2 neurons. Optogenetic excitation of vGluT2 cells evoked EPSCs in neighbouring neurons, indicating local synaptic excitation of other ARC neurons. Microdrop excitation of ARC glutamate cells in brain slices rapidly increased excitatory synaptic activity in anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin neurons. Together these data support the perspective that vGluT2 cells may be more prevalent in the ARC than previously appreciated, and play predominantly an anorectic role in energy metabolism.

[PMID: 30390285] Neurons in the brain, particularly those in the hypothalamus, are essential for the maintenance of whole-body metabolic homeostasis. Dysfunctions or dysregulations of them can result in various metabolic diseases, including eating disorders, obesity, and diabetes. In addition to hormonal and peptidergic regulation, accumulating evidence has shown that these neurons are subject to synaptic regulation, which has been largely overlooked. In this chapter, we focus on synaptic neurotransmission of hypothalamic neurons and summarize current knowledge of synaptic plasticity in the maintenance of energy balance. Synaptic modulation engaged by circulating hormones is also discussed.

[PMID: 30310864] Energy balance is regulated by anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. POMC neurons make extensive projections and are thought to release both amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters. However, whether they communicate directly with NPY/AgRP neurons is debated. Initially, using single-cell RT-PCR, we determined that mouse POMC<sup>eGFP</sup> neurons express <i>Slc17a6</i> (<i>Vglut2</i>) and <i>Slc18a2</i> (<i>Vmat2</i>), but not <i>Slc31a1</i> (<i>Vgat</i>) mRNA, suggesting glutamate and non-canonical GABA release. Quantitative (q)RT-PCR of POMC<sup>eGFP</sup> cells revealed that <i>Vglut2</i> and <i>Vmat2</i> expression was significantly increased in E2- versus oil-treated, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Since 17β-estradiol (E2) is anorexigenic, we hypothesized that an underlying mechanism is enhancement of POMC signaling. Therefore, we optogenetically stimulated POMC neurons in hypothalamic slices to examine evoked release of neurotransmitters onto NPY/AgRP neurons. Using brief light pulses, we primarily observed glutamatergic currents and, based on the paired pulse ratio (PPR), determined that release probability was higher in E2- versus oil-treated, OVX female, congruent with increased <i>Vlgut2</i> expression. Moreover, bath perfusion of the Gq-coupled membrane estrogen receptor (ER) agonist STX recapitulated the effects of E2 treatment. In addition, high-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation generated a slow outward current that reversed near E<sub>k+</sub> and was antagonized by naloxone, indicative of β-endorphin release. Furthermore, individual NPY/AgRP neurons were found to express <i>Oprm1</i>, the transcript for μ-opioid receptor, and DAMGO, a selective agonist, elicited an outward current. Therefore, POMC excitability and neurotransmission are enhanced by E2, which would facilitate decreased food consumption through marked inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons.

[PMID: 26370162] The strength of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory synaptic input is a principle determinant of neuronal activity. However, because of differences in the number of GABA afferent inputs and the sites of synapses, it is difficult to directly assay for altered GABA transmission between specific cells. The present study tested the hypothesis that the level of mRNA for the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) can provide a reliable proxy for GABA release. This was tested in a mouse hypothalamic circuit important in the regulation of energy balance. Fluorescent in situ hybridization results show that the expression of Gad1 mRNA (encoding the GAD67 enzyme) was increased in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons after an overnight fast, consistent with the ability of GABA from these neurons to stimulate food intake. Optogenetic studies confirmed that the observed increase in Gad1 mRNA correlated with an increase in the probability of GABA release from NPY/AgRP neurons onto downstream proopiomelanocortin neurons. Likewise, there was an increase in the readily releasable pool of GABA in NPY/AgRP neurons. Selective inhibition of GAD activity in NPY/AgRP neurons decreased GABA release, indicating that GAD67 activity, which is largely dictated by expression level, is a key determinant of GABA release. Altogether, it appears that Gad expression may be a reliable proxy of altered GABAergic transmission. Examining changes in Gad mRNA as a proxy for GABA release may be particularly helpful when the downstream targets are not known or when limited tools exist for detecting GABA release at a particular synapse.

[PMID: 25716862] Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) regulates vital physiological functions, including energy balance and sleep. MCH cells are thought to be GABAergic, releasing GABA to inhibit downstream targets. However, there is little experimental support for this paradigm. To better understand the synaptic mechanisms of mouse MCH neurons, we performed neuroanatomical mapping and characterization followed by optogenetics to test their functional connectivity at downstream targets. Synaptophysin-mediated projection mapping showed that the lateral septal nucleus (LS) contained the densest accumulation of MCH nerve terminals. We then expressed channel rhodopsin-2 in MCH neurons and photostimulated MCH projections to determine their effect on LS activity. Photostimulation of MCH projections evoked a monosynaptic glutamate release in the LS. Interestingly, this led to a feedforward inhibition that depressed LS firing by a robust secondary GABA release. This study presents a circuit analysis between MCH and LS neurons and confirms their functional connection via monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways. Our findings indicate that MCH neurons are not exclusively GABAergic and reveal a glutamate-mediated, feedforward mechanism that inhibits LS cells.",10
Environmental factors can influence the development of breast cancer.,environmental factors AND breast cancer AND pollutants AND endocrine disruptors,"41183465,41043533,40816212,40360080,39904262,39315735,39262136,39226766,38807590,38574449","[PMID: 41183465] Methylparaben (MEP), a ubiquitous preservative, is an endocrine disruptor with established estrogenic activity. However, its potential non-estrogenic mechanisms and causal role in breast cancer (BC) remain inadequately explored. We employed an integrative multi-omics approach. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted using genetic instruments for urinary MEP sulfate (n = 8285) and BC risk data from the FinnGen consortium (n = 182,927). To hypothesize underlying molecular mechanisms, we integrated network toxicology with transcriptomic profiling (TCGA), single-cell/spatial RNA-sequencing, and molecular docking. Shared genes were identified via Venn analysis, followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, hub gene identification, and functional enrichment analysis. MR analysis provided evidence consistent with a causal relationship, suggesting that genetically predicted MEP levels are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (IVW OR = 1.08, 95 % CI: 1.009-1.160, P = 0.027). Network toxicology identified 22 overlapping hub genes connecting MEP targets to BC pathogenesis. Enrichment analyses implicated key oncogenic pathways, including PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling, as well as metabolic reprogramming. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics localized predominant expression of hub genes like MYC and ERBB2 within malignant epithelial cells. Molecular docking further suggested plausible, high-affinity binding (binding energy < 0 kcal/mol) of MEP to core targets such as EGFR and JUN. This study provides genetic evidence supporting a potential causal role of MEP in breast cancer. We propose a novel, estrogen receptor-independent mechanistic hypothesis wherein MEP may promote tumorigenesis by dysregulating growth factor signaling, activating key transcription factors, and inducing metabolic reprogramming. These findings highlight the need for a re-evaluation of MEP's public health impact and offer a framework for future experimental validation.

[PMID: 41043533] Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and environmental factors such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) contribute to its development and progression. This review examines the roles of four major EDCs-bisphenols, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), parabens, and dioxins-integrating mechanistic and epidemiological evidence. A key pathway is the cross-talk between estrogen receptor (ER) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which regulates proliferation, survival, and immune evasion. Bisphenol A (BPA) promotes proliferation, migration, epigenetic reprogramming, and immune escape. PCBs, particularly PCB-153, are linked to metabolic alterations, inflammation, and variable epidemiological associations. Parabens, common in cosmetics, display estrogenic activity and affect oxidative stress, tumor marker expression, and metastasis. Dioxins, especially TCDD, act via AhR to induce inflammation, immunosuppression, and metastasis, with epidemiological links to cancer risk near emission sources. Collectively, these EDCs disrupt hormonal pathways, alter gene expression, and modulate the tumor microenvironment, underscoring the need for further research, regulation, and public health interventions.

[PMID: 40816212] Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in women worldwide. Data suggests that hereditary factors only account for 5-10 % of breast cancer incidence, resulting in increased concern regarding the carcinogenicity involved with environmental and lifestyle-related factors. Among these, phthalates - ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemicals founds in plastics, cosmetics, and food packaging - pose a growing concern. Human exposure to phthalates occurs through ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact, and critical windows such as intrauterine development. As an endocrine-responsive organ, the breast is particularly susceptible to disruption by these compounds. This review highlights emerging evidence linking phthalate exposure to the initiation, progression, and metastasis of breast cancer. This comprehensive overview of carcinogenesis-promoting mechanisms of phthalates, involving estrogen receptor signaling, oncogenic pathway activation, promotion of cancer stemness, and induction of therapy resistance, will provide crucial insights into phthalate-driven mechanisms in breast cancer that can inform future research directions, public health strategies, and regulatory efforts aimed at mitigating environmental cancer risks.

[PMID: 40360080] Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical compound found in a wide range of everyday consumer products, resulting in human exposure. BPA has been described as an endocrine disruptor, affecting different systems of the human body. Notably, nanomolar levels of BPA have been detected in human matrices, including plasma and milk. BPA exposure has been associated with the development of breast cancer, and the increase in breast cancer incidence prompted us to investigate the effects of BPA in MCF10A, a model of non-transformed mammary epithelium. Cells were treated with 10 nM BPA for 24 h to capture early molecular alterations preceding phenotypic transitions. Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses were conducted to identify differentially expressed genes and enriched signaling pathways. Subsequent validations included assessment of cytokine release, protein expression, immunofluorescence for subcellular localization of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB), and evaluation of actin cytoskeletal organization. Transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment in interleukin signaling and activation of the NF-κB pathway following BPA exposure. Functional assays demonstrated that BPA treatment enhanced cell motility, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κB effectively mitigated BPA-induced effects, including augmented cell motility, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Notably, inhibition of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway, and to a lesser extent of the AKT pathway, counteracted BPA-induced NF-κB activation and the associated increase in cell motility. In conclusion, we show that nanomolar concentration of BPA induces significant changes in the molecular setting and behaviour of non-tranformed breast cells, activating NF-κB signalling that in turn controls inflammation, cell cycle, proliferation and cell motility. Our findings indicate that nanomolar concentrations of BPA can induce significant molecular and behavioral changes in non-transformed breast epithelial cells. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of how environmental pollutants like BPA may perturb breast epithelial cell function and potentially contribute to carcinogenesis.

[PMID: 39904262] Current research on the relationship between environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and breast cancer remains insufficient, with limited evidence and inconsistent conclusions. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a robust method for establishing causality, as it reduces biases from confounding factors and reverse causation. This study uses MR to investigate the effects of three types of EDCs, including bisphenols, parabens, and phthalates, on the risk of overall breast cancer and its subtypes-Luminal A, Luminal B, triple negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched, and estrogen receptor-positive/negative. The study also examines the 1400 blood metabolome as potential mediators and explores EDCs-associated DNA methylation changes as potential factors, with a focus on European populations. Our results shows that n-butyl paraben (n-BuP) is positively associated with Luminal A, mono-methyl phthalate is negatively associated with Luminal B, and mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) is positively associated with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mediation analysis reveals that blood metabolites, such as caffeic acid sulfate and the caffeine-to-paraxanthine ratio, mediate the effect of n-BuP on Luminal A, while methylsuccinate mediate the effect of MiBP on TNBC. Epigenetic analysis shows associations between EDCs exposure-related DNA methylation changes at specific CpG sites (cg26325335, cg08537847, cg27454300) and different breast cancer risks. These findings not only suggest potential biomarkers for early detection and intervention but also underscore the imperative for further research to rigorously validate these associations.

[PMID: 39315735] The Breast Cancer UK-Breast Cancer Prevention Conference addressed risk from environmental pollutants and health behaviour-related breast-cancer risk. Epidemiological studies examining individual chemicals and breast cancer risk have produced inconclusive results including endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) Bisphenol A, per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances as well as aluminium. However, laboratory studies have shown that multiple EDCs, can work together to exhibit effects, even when combined at levels that alone are ineffective. The TEXB-α/β assay measures total estrogenic load, and studies have provided evidence of a link between multiple-chemical exposures and breast cancer. However, prospective studies using TEXB-α/β are needed to establish a causative link. There is also a need to assess real-life exposure to environmental-chemical mixtures during pregnancy, and their potential involvement in programming adverse foetal health outcomes in later life. Higher rates of breast cancer have occurred alongside increases in potentially-modifiable risk factors such as obesity. Increasing body-mass index is associated with increased risk of developing postmenopausal breast cancer, but with decreased risk of premenopausal breast cancer. In contrast, lower rates of breast cancer in Asian compared to Western populations have been linked to soya/isoflavone consumption. Risk is decreased by breastfeeding, which is in addition to the decrease in risk observed for each birth and a young first-birth. Risk is lower in those with higher levels of self-reported physical activity. Current evidence suggests breast-cancer survivors should also avoid weight gain, be physically active, and eat a healthy diet for overall health. A broad scientific perspective on breast cancer risk requires focus on both environmental exposure to chemicals and health behaviour-related risk. Research into chemical exposure needs to focus on chemical mixtures and prospective epidemiological studies in order to test the effects on breast cancer risk. Behaviour-related research needs to focus on implementation as well as deeper understanding of the mechanisms of cancer prevention.

[PMID: 39262136] Breast cancer is highly susceptible to metastasis formation. During the time of disease progression, tumor pathophysiology can be impacted by endogenous factors, like hormonal status, as well as by environmental exposures, such as those related to diet and lifestyle. New lines of evidence point toward a potential role for foodborne endocrine disruptive chemicals in this respect; however, mechanistic understanding remains limited. At the molecular level, crucial steps toward metastasis formation include cell structural changes, alteration of adhesion, and reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins involved in motility. Hence, this study investigates the potential of dietary xenoestrogens to impact selected aspects of breast cancer cell mechanotransduction. Taking the onset of the metastatic cascade as a model, experiments focused on cell-matrix adhesion, single-cell migration, and adaptation of cell morphology. Dietary mycoestrogens alternariol (AOH, 1 μM) and α-zearalenol (α-ZEL, 10 nM), soy isoflavone genistein (GEN, 1 μM), and food packaging plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA, 10 nM) were applied as single compounds or in mixtures. Pursuing the hypothesis that endocrine active molecules could affect cell functions beyond the estrogen receptor-dependent cascade, experiments were performed comparing the MCF-7 cell line to the triple negative breast cancer cells MDA MB-231. Indeed, the four compounds functionally affected the motility and the adhesion of both cell types. These responses were coherent with rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and with the modulation of the expression of integrin β1 and cathepsin D. Mechanistically, molecular dynamics simulations confirmed a potential interaction with fragments of the α1 and β1 integrin subunits. In sum, dietary xenoestrogens proved effective in modifying the motility and adhesion of breast cancer cells, as predictive end points for metastatic behavior <i>in vitro</i>. These effects were measurable after short incubation times (1 or 8 h) and contribute to shed novel light on the activity of compounds with hormonal mimicry potential in breast cancer progression.

[PMID: 39226766] Chemicals emitted from industrial facilities include known or suspected mammary carcinogens and endocrine disruptors, but epidemiologic studies are limited. We evaluated associations between air emissions of multiple carcinogenic chemicals and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in a large prospective U.S. We used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory to estimate historical airborne emissions (1987-1995) of 19 known and probable carcinogens for participants enrolled (1995-1996) in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Among 170,402 women, 15,124 breast cancers were diagnosed through 2018. We constructed inverse distance- and wind-weighted average emissions metrics within 1, 2, 5, and 10 km of the enrollment address for each chemical. We estimated multivariable adjusted HRs and 95 % CIs for categories (quartiles, tertiles, medians) of each chemical in association with breast cancer overall and separately by type (invasive, ductal carcinoma in situ) and estrogen receptor (ER) status. We observed an association between benzene emissions and breast cancer risk that was strongest at 1 km (HR<sub>Q4</sub> vs. non-exposed = 2.06, 95 %CI: 1.34-3.17; p-trend = 0.001). The magnitude of the association weakened with increasing distance (2 km HR<sub>Q4</sub> vs. non-exposed = 1.17, 95 %CI=0.92-1.49; p-trend = 0.19; 5 km HR<sub>Q4</sub> vs. non-exposed = 1.05, 95 %CI=0.94-1.16; p-trend = 0.37; 10 km HR<sub>Q4</sub> vs. non-exposed = 0.95, 95 %CI=0.89-1.02; p-trend = 0.19) and appeared to be most relevant for invasive rather than intraductal disease. Overall risk was also elevated for vinyl chloride at 5 km (HR<sub>≥median</sub> vs. non-exposed = 1.20, 95 %CI=1.01-1.43; p-trend = 0.04), but not 2 km or 10 km. We observed suggestive associations for asbestos, trichloroethylene, and styrene in different subgroup analyses, but risk patterns were not clear across distances. Associations with other chemicals were generally null, with limited evidence of heterogeneity by disease type or ER status. An increased risk of breast cancer associated with relatively high levels of industrial benzene emissions warrants additional study, particularly among participants with diverse sociodemographic characteristics that live in areas with higher density of industrial facilities.

[PMID: 38807590] Breast cancer stands as the most prevalent form of cancer among women globally, influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies have investigated changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) during breast cancer progression and the potential impact of environmental chemicals on miRNA expression. This review aims to provide an updated overview of miRNA alterations in breast cancer and to explore their potential association with environmental chemicals. We will discuss the current knowledge on dysregulated miRNAs in breast cancer, including both upregulated and downregulated miRNAs. Additionally, we will review the influence of environmental chemicals, such as endocrine-disrupting compounds, heavy metals, and air pollutants, on miRNA expression and their potential contribution to breast cancer development. This review aims to advance our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA dysregulation in breast cancer by comprehensively examining miRNA alterations and their association with environmental chemicals. This knowledge is crucial for the development of targeted therapies and preventive measures. Furthermore, identifying specific miRNAs affected by environmental chemicals may allow the prediction of individual susceptibility to breast cancer and the design of personalized intervention strategies.

[PMID: 38574449] A growing literature has reported associations between traffic-related air pollution and breast cancer, however there are fewer investigations into specific ambient agents and any putative risk of breast cancer development, particularly studies occurring in populations residing in higher pollution areas such as Los Angeles. To estimate breast cancer risks related to ambient air toxics exposure at residential addresses. We examined the relationships between ambient air toxics and breast cancer risk in the Multiethnic Cohort among 48,665 California female participants followed for cancer from 2003 through 2013. We obtained exposure data on chemicals acting as endocrine disruptors or mammary gland carcinogens from the National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate breast cancer risk per one interquartile range (IQR) increase in air toxics exposure lagged by 5-years. Stratified analyses were conducted by race, ethnicity, and hormone receptor types. Among all women, increased risks of invasive breast cancer were observed with toxicants related to industries [1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.22, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.18-5.60), ethylene dichloride (HR = 2.81, 95% CI 2.20-3.59), and vinyl chloride (HR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.81, 2.85); these 3 agents were correlated (r2 = 0.45-0.77)]. Agents related to gasoline production or combustion were related to increased breast cancer risk [benzene (HR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.24, 1.41), ethylbenzene (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.13-1.28), toluene (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.20-1.38), naphthalene (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-2.22), acrolein (HR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.92, 2.65)]. Higher hazard ratios were observed in African Americans and Whites compared to other racial and ethnic groups (p-heterogeneity <0.05 for traffic-related air toxics, acrolein, and vinyl acetate). Our findings suggest that specific toxic air pollutants may be associated with increase breast cancer risk.",10

Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187380] Mutations of the Ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene are generally associated with syndromic tooth agenesis, yet their influence on non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) has not been thoroughly elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of NSTA and to identify pathogenic EDA mutations in two Chinese families using whole-exome sequencing, and explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Two unrelated individuals with NSTA and their families were enrolled in this study, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Whole-exome sequencing was performed, followed by variants detection and filtering to identify pathogenic genes and mutations. The identified genetic mutations were further validated by Sanger sequencing and confirmed to be absent in 300 unrelated healthy individuals. Conservation analysis, three-dimensional (3D) modeling, and electrostatic potential calculations were conducted accordingly. We identified a novel mutation c.827 G>T (p.Arg276Leu) and a previously reported mutation c.1069 C>T (p.Arg357Trp) in the EDA gene, with the latter showing previously unreported phenotypic characteristics. Both mutations are located in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) domain of EDA, which is crucial for binding with ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR). Conservation analysis indicated that these mutations are evolutionarily conserved across various species. In silico predictions and 3D modeling analyses suggested that these mutations may be pathogenic, potentially due to alterations in the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic potential, thereby affecting EDA-EDAR interaction. Our findings broaden the mutation spectrum of EDA gene associated with NSTA by identifying a novel mutation and provide a basis for future genetic counseling.

[PMID: 41187377] Foodborne contaminants, such as mycotoxins and microplastics, pose significant threats to human health due to their high toxicity and persistence in the food chain, thus necessitate effective mitigation strategies. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), characterized by high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, safety, and environmental friendliness, offer a promising solution for adsorbing these pollutants. This review systematically explores the roles, binding locations, interaction forces, and molecular mechanisms underlying LAB-contaminant interactions, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetic properties of the adsorption processes. Notably, LAB strains with outstanding adsorption capabilities are spotlighted, along with innovative enhancement strategies: optimized culture conditions, co-culture systems, nanoparticle functionalization, immobilized cells, and combinations with bio-adsorbents. The review further demonstrates the applications of LAB in ensuring safe food production and maintaining biological health. Future directions include multi-omics-driven gene discovery, genetic engineering techniques for precision regulation, and machine learning for adsorption optimization, advancing mechanistic insights and interdisciplinary solution.

[PMID: 41187363] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains a major respiratory pathogen of economic concern in the poultry industry. This study investigated the farm-level prevalence of IBV and evaluated associated risk factors in northern Vietnam by a cross-sectional study from June 2022 to June 2024. A total of 69 poultry farms were randomly selected across nine provinces, and pooled tracheal swab samples were purposively collected for IBV detection using RT-qPCR. The overall IBV farm-level prevalence was 34.78 % (95 % CI:23.71-47.21 %). Although no statistically significant differences were found across provinces, production types, age groups, or flock sizes, IBV was detected in all subgroups, indicating widespread circulation of the virus. A total of 22 potential risk factors were initially assessed using univariate logistic regression. Of these, six variables with P < 0.1, including farm size, number of poultry houses, presence of multiple age groups, vaccination at day-old, frequency of disinfection before chick placement, and proximity to live bird markets and residential areas, were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model retained two independent predictors: performing more than one disinfection before chick placement (P = 0.035), and administration of a live IB vaccine at one day of age (P = 0.006), both of which were significantly associated with reduced the odds of IBV infection at the farm level. These findings suggest that strategic vaccination and careful calibration of disinfection protocols are critical to minimizing IBV transmission at the farm level.

[PMID: 41187352] Several investigations have identified volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as potential biomarkers for the detection and identification of microbial contamination of metabolically active mammalian cell cultures. In this study, we showed that emitted VOCs discriminate between uncontaminated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and those contaminated with the bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis or fungus Aspergillus Fumigatus separately, in vitro, using a methodology based on an adapted cell culture and thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). In addition, we elucidated a set of discriminatory volatile compounds from the MSC cultures and media alone across a time series experiment. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-variable importance in projection confirmed putative identifications of 18, 16, and 26 VOCs that showed relevant changes in a bacterial, fungal, and universal pathogen model, respectively, with an accuracy of 100% in the fungal model. Among these metabolites, octane, 2,5,6-trimethyl- overlapped between the three groups. Furthermore, a total of 15 VOCs were found most relevant to cell culture expansion over three days based on cluster analysis. This novel study goes a step further in identifying distinct VOC signatures of MSCs contaminated with S. epidermidis or A. fumigatus, and in monitoring MSCs proliferation over time. This pilot study shows preliminary results that indicate that VOC headspace analysis could serve as a suitable, rapid, non-invasive, and non-destructive tool for the metabolic and growth monitoring of MSCs in a dynamic cell culture bioreactor system.

[PMID: 41187325] Strabismus measurement is essential in vision assessment and screening. It typically requires skilled clinicians or specialized equipment. Photographic strabismus measurement methods have value in terms of accessibility and convenience of use. This study aimed to evaluate Eyeturn Cloud, a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) system for measuring strabismus angles based on eye images captured with smartphone cameras under cover test conditions. The Eyeturn Cloud web app uses AI models to recognize eyes, eye lid, and iris, and then to segment iris precisely. It then computes strabismus based on ellipse fitting of the iris boundary and corneal reflection. The system was evaluated in patients (without glasses) with manifest strabismus and control participants. Clinicians measured eye deviations using the prism alternate cover test and also captured pictures of their eyes under alternate cover and unilateral cover conditions. The pictures were processed by Eyeturn Cloud. In total, 79 (mean age 11.9, SD 6.3 years; esotropia: n=15, exotropia: n=55, orthotropia: n=9) participants were enrolled; of which, data were available for 71 participants (8/79, 10.1% processing failure). The range of prism alternate cover test strabismus magnitude was from 78 base in to 78 base out prism diopters (PDs). A strong correlation was found between Eyeturn Cloud and clinical measurements (R<sup>2</sup>=0.95; slope=0.91; P<.001). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that 95% limits of agreement between the 2 measurements were -20.2 to 14.6 PD. A repeatability test with 15 participants (4 photos each) found a 1.53 PD SD. The cloud AI web app can compute strabismus angles reliably under alternate and unilateral cover conditions in clinical settings, and its potential for use in telehealth settings needs further evaluation.

[PMID: 41187307] Vascular dysfunction contributes to Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRDs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies link midlife hemostasis and platelet aggregation measures to late-life dementia risk. We aimed to determine whether platelet aggregation in midlife is associated with imaging markers of AD pathology. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated associations between platelet aggregation, measured by light transmission aggregometry, and amyloid (<sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET uptake in dementia-free, middle-aged adults from the Framingham Heart Study. Co-primary outcomes included amyloid and tau uptake in AD-vulnerable regions. We also examined an MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk as a secondary outcome. We used multivariable regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, considering potential nonlinear associations. Platelet aggregation response was evaluated in 382 participants (mean age 56 ± 8 years, 53% female) approximately 1.2-1.5 years before amyloid and tau PET imaging. MRI data used for the AD signature were acquired together with PET imaging or within several months. The aggregation response exhibited a nonlinear association with AD pathology. Among those in the lowest tertile of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) response, platelet aggregation response was positively associated with increased amyloid in the precuneus (β = 0.047, <i>p</i> = 0.020) and tau in the rhinal (β = 0.077, <i>p</i> = 0.012), entorhinal (β = 0.066, <i>p</i> < 0.020), temporal global (β = 0.063, <i>p</i> = 0.031), and cortical (β = 0.064, <i>p</i> = 0.028) regions. For the secondary outcome analysis (n = 256), platelet aggregation response was negatively associated with the MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk (β = -0.002, <i>p</i> < 0.035), consistent with a neurodegenerative pattern. Our findings indicate that platelet aggregation is linked to PET and MRI markers of AD pathology as early as midlife. These findings support further investigation of platelet-mediated mechanisms in AD pathogenesis.

[PMID: 41187282] Opioid overdose is a global public health emergency, with the United States experiencing high rates of morbidity and mortality due to prescription and illicit opioid use. Traditional public health monitoring systems often fail to provide real-time insights, limiting their capacity for early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, especially Reddit, offer a promising alternative for timely toxicovigilance due to the abundance of user-generated, real-time content. This study aimed to explore the use of Reddit as a real-time, high-volume source for toxicovigilance and develop an automated system that can classify and analyze opioid-related social media posts to detect behavioral patterns and monitor the evolution of public discourse on opioid use. To investigate evolving social media discourse around opioid use, we collected a large-scale dataset from Reddit spanning 6 years, from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2023. Using a comprehensive opioid lexicon-including formal drug names, street slang, common misspellings, and abbreviations-we filtered relevant posts for further analysis. A subset of these data was manually annotated according to well-defined annotation guidelines into 4 categories: self-misuse, external misuse, information, and unrelated, with distributions of 37.21%, 27.25%, 27.57%, and 7.97%, respectively. To automate the classification of opioid-related chatter, we developed a robust natural language processing pipeline leveraging classical machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and transformer-based architecture, and fine-tuned a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM; OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo). In the final stage, the trained LLM was deployed on an unlabeled dataset comprising 74,975 additional Reddit chatter posts. This enabled a detailed temporal analysis of opioid-related discussions, aligned with 6 years of opioid-related death records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For this study, self-misuse and external misuse were merged into a misuse category for direct comparison with the CDC's mortality data, examining whether trends in social media discourse on opioid misuse reflect patterns in real-world mortality statistics. The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 0.93, outperforming the baseline (random forest 0.85) by representing a performance improvement of 9.14% over the machine learning model. The temporal analysis of the unlabeled data revealed evolving trends in opioid-related discussions, indicating shifts in user behavior and overdose-related chatter over time. To quantify this relationship, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between misuse-related posts and CDC death records (r=0.854). This correlation was statistically significant (P<.001), indicating a strong positive relationship between web-based discussions and CDC mortality data. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating advanced natural language processing techniques and LLMs with social media data to support real-time public health surveillance. Reddit provides a valuable platform for identifying emerging trends in opioid use and overdose risk. The proposed system offers a proactive tool for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to better understand and respond to the opioid crisis.

[PMID: 41187267] The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Specifically, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic data sets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yields 1,865 high-confidence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular fingerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding affinity profiles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

[PMID: 41187261] Human-centered design (HCD) is vital for crafting impactful and successful health interventions. This approach has been effective in enhancing the uptake of health services, especially in rural areas. The Routine Immunization Buddy System (RIBS) is an HCD-driven intervention designed to support economically disadvantaged caregivers by empowering them to take greater responsibility for their own health and the immunization of their children. Through a community-based participatory research (CBPR), this study seeks to understand the economic, social, and health lifestyles and the impact on the health-seeking attributes of the potential beneficiaries of the project. This ensures that the identified intervention and its strategy will be implemented in a way that is of utmost benefit to the users. Using a 3-step HCD process-discovery, ideation, and formulation-the study conducted focus group discussions and key informant interviews for caregivers and stakeholders capable of influencing the woman's decision within a health setting. Semistructured interviews facilitated an in-depth exploration of participants' experiences. Data collection used audio and video recordings, detailed notes, and observation sessions. Data analysis encompassed transcription, descriptive analysis, and thematic analysis to inform evidence-based interventions. Four key interconnected barriers to routine immunization were identified from the formative research: (1) vaccine hesitancy, which is driven by safety concerns and inconsistency in vaccine-related messaging; (2) gender-based decision-making constraints, where male approval often influenced access to care; (3) financial limitations affecting transport and medical costs; and (4) unequal access to health care due to geographic disparities. Caregivers emphasized the need for economic empowerment and trusted community-based health education. These findings informed a critical redesign of the intervention from a 2-arm to a 3-arm model, with peer support groups and financial empowerment components added to address both economic barriers and vaccine misinformation through culturally tailored approaches. The use of HCD-informed formative research has helped identify tailored women's empowerment strategies, such as economic support, community-led advocacy, and peer networks, that show promise in addressing health disparities among caregivers. These approaches are hoped to enhance caregivers' ability to make informed health decisions, ultimately contributing to improved immunization uptake and broader community well-being. The insights from this research are actively informing the design of our upcoming cluster randomized controlled trial, which aims to strengthen women's decision-making power around immunization services.",10
Excess gestational weight gain is associated with obesity-related pregnancy outcomes.,excess gestational weight gain AND obesity-related pregnancy outcomes AND maternal-fetal outcomes AND pregnancy complications,"37431342,27017177,23074010,21453562,17213880,41187368,41187192,41186980,41186948,41186803","[PMID: 37431342] Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. Until recently, the only effective method for treating morbid obesity over the long term was bariatric surgery (BS). During pregnancy, obesity is correlated with higher risks for numerous complications, including gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, mortality, and large-for-gestational-age neonates. The most commonly reported complications among women who underwent sleeve gastrectomy and experienced pregnancy were placental bleeding, oligohydramnios, urinary tract infection, appendicitis, and recurrent abortions. We aim to estimate the consequence of sleeve gastrectomy and its relation with pregnancy outcomes among women in Saudi Arabia. This study adopted a quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional design. It was conducted in Saudi Arabia between February and May 2023 among women who became pregnant after undergoing sleeve gastrectomy.  Result: Anemia was experienced by 78.8% of the patients during pregnancy. In our study, 18% of the individuals experienced complications during or right after delivery, with postpartum hemorrhage being the most frequent (43.1%). We discovered that pre-eclampsia and delivering a baby small for gestational age were considerably more common in pregnant women who smoked (p ≤ 0.05). On the other hand, no significant association was discovered between any comorbidity and mode of delivery, birth weight, child complications, or difficulties that occurred during or right after labor. We concluded that weight gain after sleeve gastrectomy negatively impacted pregnancy and increased the probability of several complications for the mother and fetus. Healthcare providers must inform every woman undergoing BS about the possible complication of an unhealthy lifestyle after the procedure.

[PMID: 27017177] It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that all women of reproductive age receive education about maternal and fetal risks associated with prepregnancy obesity, excessive gestational weight gain, and significant postpartum weight retention, including potential benefits of lifestyle changes. Behavioral counseling to improve dietary intake and physical activity should be provided to overweight and obese women, beginning in the preconception period and continuing throughout pregnancy, for at least 12 to 18 months postpartum. Weight loss before pregnancy may improve fertility and reduce the risk of poor maternal-fetal outcomes, such as preterm birth, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, assisted delivery, and select congenital anomalies. Lifestyle interventions that moderate gestational weight gain may reduce the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, large for gestational age, and macrosomia, as well as lower the risk for significant postpartum retention. Postpartum interventions that promote healthy diet and physical activity behaviors may reduce postpartum weight retention and decrease obesity-related risks in subsequent pregnancies. Analysis of the evidence suggests that there is good evidence to support the role of diet, physical activity, and behavior changes in promoting optimal weight gain during pregnancy; however, there is currently a relative lack of evidence in other areas related to reproductive outcomes.

[PMID: 23074010] Obesity-related infertility is one of the most common problems of reproductive-age obese women who desire childbearing. The various types of bariatric surgeries have proved effective in controlling excessive weight gain, improving fertility, and preventing certain maternal and fetal complications in these women. This article summarizes the current evidence regarding the impact of bariatric surgery on obesity-related infertility and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. We have also attempted to draw conclusions about maternal and fetal risks and the benefits of bariatric surgery. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and Roux-en-Y procedures are the two most commonly performed bariatric surgeries. Bariatric surgery was believed to improve menstrual irregularity and increase ovulation rate in anovulatory obese women, which lead to increased pregnancy rates. Although there are data in the literature suggesting the improvement of both the ovulatory function and the spontaneous pregnancy rates in obese women who lost weight after bariatric surgery, most of these are case-control studies with a small number of patients. The data are insufficient to determine an ideal time interval for pregnancy after bariatric surgery; however, the general consensus is that pregnancy should be delayed 12 to 18 months after bariatric surgery to avoid nutritional deficiencies. Few data exist regarding IVF success rates in women who have undergone bariatric surgery. One pairwise study discussed five patients who underwent bariatric surgery followed by IVF that resulted in three term pregnancies in three patients after the first IVF cycle. Many studies reported reductions in obesity-related pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders after bariatric surgery. Although data are inconsistent, some studies reported increased rate of preterm delivery and small for gestational age infants after bariatric surgery. Pregnancies after bariatric surgery may be considered high risk due to the concerns for vitamin deficiencies and gastrointestinal symptoms related to the surgery. Therefore the follow-up of these pregnancies might require a team approach including a maternal fetal medicine specialist, bariatric surgeon, and nutritionist.

[PMID: 21453562] Misclassification of body mass index (BMI) by pregnant women could be a significant barrier to minimizing weight-related adverse pregnancy outcomes and improving the short- and long-term health of mother and child. The primary objective in this study was to determine the proportion of a group of pregnant women who were able to correctly classify BMI. Secondary objectives included assessing the direction of BMI misclassification and maternal knowledge of target gestational weight gain and obesity-associated pregnancy complications. We designed a cross-sectional survey to assess misclassification of BMI and knowledge of obesity and pregnancy outcomes, and to provide information regarding the participants' sources of knowledge, their perception of appropriate weight gain in pregnancy, and basic demographic information. The questionnaire was completed by participants awaiting routine ultrasound assessment at between 11 and 24 weeks' gestation. Of 117 respondents, 30 (25.6%) were overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9) or obese (BMI ≥ 30.0). Obese or overweight women were significantly more likely to misclassify their BMI. Furthermore, they were significantly more likely to overestimate the minimum and maximum target gestational weight gains for their respective BMI classes. There were no differences between women in the various BMI categories with regard to their awareness of several common obesity-related pregnancy complications. Misclassification of pre-pregnancy BMI is common, particularly among women carrying excess weight. Evaluation of pre-pregnancy BMI and education regarding appropriate gestational weight gain are logical initial steps for optimizing weight-related pregnancy outcomes.

[PMID: 17213880] Evidence-based guidelines indicate that regular prenatal exercise is an important component of a healthy pregnancy. In addition to maintaining physical fitness, exercise may be beneficial in preventing or treating maternal-fetal diseases. Women who are the most physically active have the lowest prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM), and prevention of GDM may decrease the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes in both mother and offspring. However, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of exercise in delaying or preventing GDM in at-risk women, and exercise prescriptions that optimize outcomes for women with GDM are lacking. Physically active women are also less likely to develop pre-eclampsia, and we have proposed the following 4 mechanisms that may explain this protective effect: enhanced placental growth and vascularity, reduced oxidative stress, reduced inflammation, and correction of disease-related endothelial dysfunction. Exercise may also prevent reproductive complications associated with maternal obesity. Obesity increases the risk of infertility and miscarriage, and weight loss programs that incorporate diet and exercise are a cost-effective fertility treatment that may also reduce the probability of obesity-related complications during pregnancy. Regular exercise following conception may prevent excessive gestational weight gain and reduce post-partum weight retention.

[PMID: 41187368] Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the standard drug for treatment of eclampsia, and to prevent its occurrence in women with preeclampsia with severe features, however, the ideal postpartum treatment duration remains unclear. To assess whether a 12-hour postpartum MgSO4 regimen is non-inferior to the standard 24-hour regimen. This was a single-center, randomized, non-blinded, non-inferiority clinical trial conducted at a tertiary hospital in Brazil. The intervention involved the use of MgSO4 for 12 h after childbirth, compared to the standard regimen of 24 h. Women were randomly assigned to each group. The primary outcome was a new use of MgSO4 due to recurrence of symptoms within the first 10 days of childbirth. Secondary outcomes included maternal complications, pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal outcomes. 79 women were included in this study (40 in the 12-hour group and 39 in the 24-hour group). The demographic characteristics of women in both groups were similar. The rate of use of MgSO4 in the postpartum was similar in both groups (4 vs 9, 10.0 % vs 23.1 %, p = 0.206). After enrolment, no cases of eclampsia occurred in the 12-hour group, and one occurred in the 24-hour group. No significant differences were found regarding birth weight, Apgar scores, or NICU admissions. A 12-hour magnesium sulfate regimen was non-inferior to the 24-hour standard, supporting its safety and potential utility in optimizing postpartum care, especially in resource-constrained settings.

[PMID: 41187192] This study aimed to assess tetanus seropositivity levels among adult patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital following rabies risk exposure, and to explore potential factors influencing their immunological status. This cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study included 182 adult individuals (68 females and 114 males) who presented to the hospital following rabies risk exposure. The demographic data was collected during a face-to-face interview, and the tetanus antibody concentrations were assessed using a micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Serum antibody levels of ≥ 0.1 IU/mL were defined as ""seropositive"", while values below this threshold were considered ""seronegative"". Seropositivity was identified in 81.9% of the patients. There was a significant decline in antibody levels with age (p < 0.001). The Spearman correlation analysis showed a moderately significant negative correlation between age and antibody titers (r = - 0.404, p < 0.001). In addition, there were significantly higher tetanus antibody levels in patients from urban areas, those vaccinated during pregnancy, and those vaccinated within the past 10 years (p = 0.025, 0.036, and 0.013, respectively). Overall, the results highlight a reduction in tetanus antibody levels with age, emphasizing the importance of receiving a booster dose every 10 years. In addition, rabies risk exposure, particularly in older adults, presents a valuable opportunity to administer tetanus vaccination.

[PMID: 41186980] In Lebanon, disadvantaged pregnant women show poor maternal outcomes due to limited access to antenatal care (ANC) and a strained health care system, compounded by ongoing conflicts and a significant refugee population. Despite substantial efforts to improve maternal health, the provision of maternal health services in primary health care centers (PHCs) still faces significant challenges. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, particularly those using artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification, are proving effective in addressing gaps in maternal health services by offering scalable and accessible care. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an AI-based gamified intervention, Gamification and Artificial Intelligence and mHealth Network for Maternal Health Improvement (GAIN MHI), on maternal health outcomes and uptake of ANC services among disadvantaged populations in Lebanon. The study was a community interventional trial with historical controls, conducted across 19 randomly allocated PHCs in 5 Lebanese governorates. Participants included pregnant women in their first trimester visiting PHCs. The intervention used mHealth tools, including educational mobile-based messages, appointment reminders, and the GAIN MHI app, which provided AI-driven and gamified learning for health care providers (HCPs). Data collected covered demographics, medical history, and maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Key outcome measures included uptake of health care services (eg, ANC visits, supplement intake, ultrasound completion, lab tests) and maternal and neonatal outcomes (eg, term delivery, normal delivery, abortion rate, neonatal morbidity, maternal complications). This study included 3989 participants, divided between a control group (n=1993, 50%) and an intervention group (n=1996, 50%). Regression models adjusting for demographics, health, and obstetric characteristics showed significantly higher odds in the intervention group for completing 4 or more ANC visits (odds ratio [OR] 1.569, 95% CI 1.329-1.852, P<.05), completing lab tests (OR 1.821, 95% CI 1.514-2.191, P<.05), 2 or more ultrasound screenings (OR 7.984, 95% CI 6.687-9.523, P<.05), urine analysis (OR 4.399, 95% CI 3.631-5.330, P<.05), and supplement intake (OR 3.508, 95% CI 2.982-4.128, P<.05). Regarding outcomes, the intervention group had 29.5% increased odds of a term delivery (OR 1.295, 95% CI 1.095-1.532, P=.002) and 58% increased odds of avoiding neonatal morbidity (OR 1.580, 95% CI 1.185-2.108, P=.002). However, both groups showed decreased odds of normal delivery (intervention: OR 0.774, 95% CI 0.657-0.911; control: OR 0.823, 95% CI 0.701-0.964) and increased odds of maternal complications (intervention: OR 0.535, 95% CI 0.449-0.637; control: OR 0.586, 95% CI 0.474-0.723; P<.05). The GAIN MHI intervention effectively improves uptake of ANC and maternal and neonatal outcomes. Our findings highlight the potential of mHealth interventions to enhance health care delivery. To sustain these improvements, future research should focus on integrating mHealth with other interventions that address socioeconomic and contextual factors. This approach will further optimize maternal and neonatal health outcomes among disadvantaged populations.

[PMID: 41186948] Advanced imaging to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE) during pregnancy increases costs, ionizing radiation exposure, and the risk of overdiagnosis. D-dimer testing can exclude PE and compression ultrasonography can diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), both reducing advanced imaging needs. How these 2 strategies are used in community PE diagnostics is unknown. To analyze the use and efficiencies of D-dimer and ultrasonography for the diagnosis of antenatal PE. This retrospective cohort study was performed in 21 US community hospitals from October 1, 2021, to March 31, 2023. Participants included pregnant patients who underwent D-dimer testing, compression ultrasonography, or advanced imaging for suspected PE. D-dimer testing or ultrasonography. The main outcome was avoidance of advanced imaging, measured by the number needed to test (NNT) to avoid 1 advanced imaging study using low to intermediate D-dimer values or a positive ultrasonography finding. Variables associated with D-dimer and ultrasonography were evaluated using quasi-Poisson regression reported as adjusted relative risks (ARRs). A total of 720 outpatient encounters in 699 patients were included in the analysis (median age, 30.2 [IQR, 24.3-36.1] years). D-dimer testing was obtained in 524 patients (72.8%). Advanced imaging was not pursued in 149 of 155 patients (96.1%) with low (<0.5 mg/L) and 82 of 179 (45.8%) with intermediate (0.5 to <1.0 mg/L) D-dimer values, yielding an NNT to avoid 1 advanced imaging study of 2.3 (95% CI, 2.0-2.6). No 90-day venous thromboembolism or death occurred following rule-outs. D-dimer testing was less commonly used in third (vs first) trimester (ARR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97); with unilateral signs or symptoms of DVT (vs none) (ARR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.82), and during labor and delivery unit (vs emergency department) evaluation (ARR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20-0.35). Compression ultrasonography was performed in 229 patients (31.8%), with DVT diagnosed in 3 (1.3%). Advanced imaging was not pursued in 2 of these patients, yielding an NNT to avoid 1 advanced imaging study of 115 (95% CI, 32-417). Ultrasonography use and results varied by DVT symptoms. Among 55 patients with DVT symptoms, 46 (83.6%) underwent ultrasonography, with positive findings in 3 (yield of 6.5%). Among 665 patients without symptoms, 183 (27.5%) underwent ultrasonography, with negative findings in all (yield of 0). In this cohort study, use of D-dimer testing was efficient and safe with opportunities for expansion across settings and patients. These findings suggest that ultrasonography efficiency was low but could be improved with symptom-driven use in antenatal PE diagnostics.

[PMID: 41186803] Perinatal bipolar disorder (BD) presents unique challenges due to physiological, hormonal, and psychosocial changes during pregnancy and postpartum, increasing vulnerability to mood instability. Effective management is vital for maternal and infant health, but multiple barriers complicate care. This review aims to clarify whether obstacles arise from limited psychiatric expertise among obstetric providers, insufficient perinatal knowledge among psychiatric providers, or both. A thematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, synthesizing literature (2015-2025) from major databases and clinical guidelines on barriers and solutions in perinatal BD management. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were included. Data extraction, quality assessment, and thematic analysis were performed by multiple independent reviewers. Four major barriers were identified: (i) Diagnostic challenges-obstetric providers may miss or misdiagnose BD due to symptom overlap with normal perinatal changes, while psychiatric providers may lack specific perinatal expertise; (ii) Treatment issues-concerns about medication safety, particularly among obstetricians, and limited access to specialized psychiatric care, leading to increased relapse risk; (iii) Psychosocial barriers-stigma, inadequate support, and new maternal responsibilities hinder help-seeking; (iv) Poor interprofessional communication-fragmented care often results when obstetric and psychiatric providers lack coordination. These barriers adversely impact both mothers and infants, increasing relapse rates and impairing mother-infant bonding. Proposed solutions include improved diagnostic training for both provider types, integrated care models, enhanced patient education, support systems, and policy reforms. However, there remain knowledge gaps regarding long-term outcomes and optimal screening. Effective perinatal BD management requires multidisciplinary, individualized, and integrated care addressing both clinical and psychosocial barriers. Bridging knowledge gaps between obstetric and psychiatric providers through education, research, and policy reform is essential to improve outcomes for mothers and their families.",10
Exercise reduces cancer mortality rates among Chinese citizens.,Exercise AND Cancer Mortality AND China AND Physical Activity,"41184253,41120824,41092928,41092927,41088325,41067433,41057532,41029167,41019083,41018094","[PMID: 41184253] Glioma is the most common primary brain tumors and has a high recurrence and mortality rate after surgery. Most gliomas are of astrocytic origin. We recently demonstrated that Celsr2 is essential for injury-induced responses and functions of astrocytes, while its role in the development and treatment of gliomas remains unexplored. In this study, an increase of CELSR2 expression was identified in patient glioma samples and glioma cell lines, and higher levels of CELSR2 correlate with poorer patient survival as indicated by TCGA data. In cultured glioma cells, CELSR2 knockdown reduced proliferation and caused cell cycle arrest, which was further supported by proteomic analysis. CELSR2 knockdown inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the effect could be reversed by activating β-catenin using GSK-3β inhibitor in glioma cells. WNT3A efficiently enhanced the proliferation of glioma cells and activated the downstream signaling, which were significantly compromised by CELSR2 knockdown. We developed magnetic nanoparticles loaded with CELSR2-siRNA, which suppressed tumor growth in glioma-inoculated nude mice. In conclusion, CELSR2 positively regulates glioma development through WNT3A/β-catenin signaling and inhibiting CESLR2 is a novel therapeutic strategy for gliomas.

[PMID: 41120824] It remains unclear whether achieving the physical activity guidelines through occupational activity alone, nonoccupational activity alone, or combined occupational and nonoccupational activity has different health consequences. Adults aged 18 years or older in the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) from 2007 to 2018 were prospectively observed. Mortality data were acquired from the National Death Index through December 31, 2019. Time of self-reported occupational and nonoccupational activity was calculated. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome, with cardiovascular and cancer mortality as secondary outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the association of occupational and nonoccupational activity with mortality. During a median follow-up of 6.92 years, 23 752 participants were included in our analysis, with 1367 deaths recorded, including 367 cardiovascular and 328 cancer deaths. Compared with inactive participants, those achieving recommended activity levels through occupational activity alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.60-0.94]), nonoccupational activity alone (HR, 0.58, [95% CI, 0.47-0.71]), or combined activity (HR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.33-0.56]) had lower all-cause mortality. Additionally, those achieving recommended activity levels through nonoccupational activity alone (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.36-0.71]) or combined activity (HR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.20-0.57]) had lower cardiovascular mortality. However, occupational activity alone (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.61-1.29]), nonoccupational activity alone (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.66-1.46]), and combined activity (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.38-1.11]) were not associated with cancer mortality. Achieving recommended activity levels through any domain was associated with lower all-cause mortality. Nonoccupational activity alone or combined activity was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. Participants in occupational activity alone may benefit more if they also achieve recommended activity levels through nonoccupational activity.

[PMID: 41092928] Timely and comprehensive analyses of causes of death stratified by age, sex, and location are essential for shaping effective health policies aimed at reducing global mortality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides cause-specific mortality estimates measured in counts, rates, and years of life lost (YLLs). GBD 2023 aimed to enhance our understanding of the relationship between age and cause of death by quantifying the probability of dying before age 70 years (70q0) and the mean age at death by cause and sex. This study enables comparisons of the impact of causes of death over time, offering a deeper understanding of how these causes affect global populations. GBD 2023 produced estimates for 292 causes of death disaggregated by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2023. We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric. Findings are reported as counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2023 include a correction for the misclassification of deaths due to COVID-19, updates to the method used to estimate COVID-19, and updates to the CODEm modelling framework. This analysis used 55 761 data sources, including vital registration and verbal autopsy data as well as data from surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. For GBD 2023, there were 312 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 3 country-years of surveillance data, 51 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 144 country-years of other data types that were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic caused shifts in long-standing rankings of the leading causes of global deaths: it ranked as the number one age-standardised cause of death at Level 3 of the GBD cause classification hierarchy in 2021. By 2023, COVID-19 dropped to the 20th place among the leading global causes, returning the rankings of the leading two causes to those typical across the time series (ie, ischaemic heart disease and stroke). While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause. Compared to 1990, there has been a considerable reduction in total YLLs in many vaccine-preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. In addition, this study quantified the mean age at death for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and found noticeable variation by sex and location. The global all-cause mean age at death increased from 46·8 years (95% UI 46·6-47·0) in 1990 to 63·4 years (63·1-63·7) in 2023. For males, mean age increased from 45·4 years (45·1-45·7) to 61·2 years (60·7-61·6), and for females it increased from 48·5 years (48·1-48·8) to 65·9 years (65·5-66·3), from 1990 to 2023. The highest all-cause mean age at death in 2023 was found in the high-income super-region, where the mean age for females reached 80·9 years (80·9-81·0) and for males 74·8 years (74·8-74·9). By comparison, the lowest all-cause mean age at death occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was 38·0 years (37·5-38·4) for females and 35·6 years (35·2-35·9) for males in 2023. Lastly, our study found that all-cause 70q0 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, although with large variability between them. For females, we found that 70q0 notably increased from drug use disorders and conflict and terrorism. Leading causes that increased 70q0 for males also included drug use disorders, as well as diabetes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there was an increase in 70q0 for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Additionally, the mean age at death from NCDs was lower than the expected mean age at death for this super-region. By comparison, there was an increase in 70q0 for drug use disorders in the high-income super-region, which also had an observed mean age at death lower than the expected value. We examined global mortality patterns over the past three decades, highlighting-with enhanced estimation methods-the impacts of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to broader trends such as increasing NCDs in low-income regions that reflect ongoing shifts in the global epidemiological transition. This study also delves into premature mortality patterns, exploring the interplay between age and causes of death and deepening our understanding of where targeted resources could be applied to further reduce preventable sources of mortality. We provide essential insights into global and regional health disparities, identifying locations in need of targeted interventions to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases. There is an ever-present need for strengthened health-care systems that are resilient to future pandemics and the shifting burden of disease, particularly among ageing populations in regions with high mortality rates. Robust estimates of causes of death are increasingly essential to inform health priorities and guide efforts toward achieving global health equity. The need for global collaboration to reduce preventable mortality is more important than ever, as shifting burdens of disease are affecting all nations, albeit at different paces and scales.

[PMID: 41092927] Comprehensive, comparable, and timely estimates of demographic metrics-including life expectancy and age-specific mortality-are essential for evaluating, understanding, and addressing trends in population health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of timely and all-cause mortality estimates for being able to respond to changing trends in health outcomes, showing a strong need for demographic analysis tools that can produce all-cause mortality estimates more rapidly with more readily available all-age vital registration (VR) data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is an ongoing research effort that quantifies human health by estimating a range of epidemiological quantities of interest across time, age, sex, location, cause, and risk. This study-part of the latest GBD release, GBD 2023-aims to provide new and updated estimates of all-cause mortality and life expectancy for 1950 to 2023 using a novel statistical model that accounts for complex correlation structures in demographic data across age and time. We used 24 025 data sources from VR, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources to estimate all-cause mortality for males, females, and all sexes combined across 25 age groups in 204 countries and territories as well as 660 subnational units in 20 countries and territories, for the years 1950-2023. For the first time, we used complete birth history data for ages 5-14 years, age-specific sibling history data for ages 15-49 years, and age-specific mortality data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. We developed a single statistical model that incorporates both parametric and non-parametric methods, referred to as OneMod, to produce estimates of all-cause mortality for each age-sex-location group. OneMod includes two main steps: a detailed regression analysis with a generalised linear modelling tool that accounts for age-specific covariate effects such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a population attributable fraction (PAF) for all risk factors combined; and a non-parametric analysis of residuals using a multivariate kernel regression model that smooths across age and time to adaptably follow trends in the data without overfitting. We calibrated asymptotic uncertainty estimates using Pearson residuals to produce 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) and corresponding 1000 draws. Life expectancy was calculated from age-specific mortality rates with standard demographic methods. For each measure, 95% UIs were calculated with the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. In 2023, 60·1 million (95% UI 59·0-61·1) deaths occurred globally, of which 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) were in children younger than 5 years. Due to considerable population growth and ageing since 1950, the number of annual deaths globally increased by 35·2% (32·2-38·4) over the 1950-2023 study period, during which the global age-standardised all-cause mortality rate declined by 66·6% (65·8-67·3). Trends in age-specific mortality rates between 2011 and 2023 varied by age group and location, with the largest decline in under-5 mortality occurring in east Asia (67·7% decrease); the largest increases in mortality for those aged 5-14 years, 25-29 years, and 30-39 years occurring in high-income North America (11·5%, 31·7%, and 49·9%, respectively); and the largest increases in mortality for those aged 15-19 years and 20-24 years occurring in Eastern Europe (53·9% and 40·1%, respectively). We also identified higher than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 5-14 years (87·3% higher in GBD 2023 than GBD 2021 on average across countries and territories over the 1950-2021 period) and for females aged 15-29 years (61·2% higher), as well as lower than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 50 years and older (13·2% lower), reflecting advances in our modelling approach. Global life expectancy followed three distinct trends over the study period. First, between 1950 and 2019, there were considerable improvements, from 51·2 (50·6-51·7) years for females and 47·9 (47·4-48·4) years for males in 1950 to 76·3 (76·2-76·4) years for females and 71·4 (71·3-71·5) years for males in 2019. Second, this period was followed by a decrease in life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to 74·7 (74·6-74·8) years for females and 69·3 (69·2-69·4) years for males in 2021. Finally, the world experienced a period of post-pandemic recovery in 2022 and 2023, wherein life expectancy generally returned to pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2023 (76·3 [76·0-76·6] years for females and 71·5 [71·2-71·8] years for males). 194 (95·1%) of 204 countries and territories experienced at least partial post-pandemic recovery in age-standardised mortality rates by 2023, with 61·8% (126 of 204) recovering to or falling below pre-pandemic levels. There were several mortality trajectories during and following the pandemic across countries and territories. Long-term mortality trends also varied considerably between age groups and locations, demonstrating the diverse landscape of health outcomes globally. This analysis identified several key differences in mortality trends from previous estimates, including higher rates of adolescent mortality, higher rates of young adult mortality in females, and lower rates of mortality in older age groups in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also highlight stark differences across countries and territories in the timing and scale of changes in all-cause mortality trends during and following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-23). Our estimates of evolving trends in mortality and life expectancy across locations, ages, sexes, and SDI levels in recent years as well as over the entire 1950-2023 study period provide crucial information for governments, policy makers, and the public to ensure that health-care systems, economies, and societies are prepared to address the world's health needs, particularly in populations with higher rates of mortality than previously known. The estimates from this study provide a robust framework for GBD and a valuable foundation for policy development, implementation, and evaluation around the world. Gates Foundation.

[PMID: 41088325] In recent years, the incidence of cancer has been on the rise worldwide due to environmental pollution, poor lifestyle habits, and increasing medical diagnoses. In China, the incidence and mortality of lung cancer both rank first among malignant tumors. In the process of cancer diagnosis and treatment, patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy experience a serious symptom burden. Inadequate symptom management will aggravate the physical and mental pain of patients and even delay or interrupt the treatment of the disease. Therefore, it is urgent to provide symptom management programs for medical staff and patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. To construct the central symptom cluster management program for patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy (CSCMP). Under the guidance of Symptom Management Theory (SMT), the draft program was formed in December 2023 through the clinical expert meeting based on the best evidence summary, and the final program was formed after two rounds of Delphi with 17 experts between December 2023 and March 2024. Descriptive statistics and consistency tests (Kendall's W) were used to analyze the data. The final program consists of 12 items in 7 different dimensions. The 7 dimensions are intervention symptom, intervention method, intervention time, intervention content, intervention personnel, intervention place, and intervention form. The 12 items include intervention training, focus assessment, health guidance, diet nursing, psychological nursing, exercise intervention, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) intervention, energy-saving skills, life nursing, environmental nursing, sleep hygiene, and follow-up.

[PMID: 41067433] Smoking is the most significant risk factor for major diseases, including cancer, respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Extensive studies have identified physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) as modifiable lifestyle factors that provide substantial health benefits. This study aimed to assess the effects of PA and SB on smoking-related mortality. This study included 8542 adults from the 2014-2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, with mortality follow-up data tracked through 2019. PA, SB, and smoking status were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. Cox regression was used to estimate the individual and combined effects of smoking status, PA, and SB on all-cause and CVD-related mortality. The interactions were assessed using a multiplicative scale. As of December 31, 2019, a total of 147 participants had died from all causes, including 32 deaths attributed to CVD. Both smokers (all-cause: 0.49 [0.32-0.76], CVD: 0.22 [0.06-0.76]) and nonsmokers (all-cause: 0.38 [0.21-0.68], CVD: 0.18 [0.05-0.64]) who adhered to PA guidelines exhibited significant reductions in mortality rates. Similarly, limiting daily sedentary time to <8 hours reduced mortality rates in both smokers and nonsmokers, with more pronounced effects in nonsmokers (all-cause: 0.34 [0.19-0.61], CVD: 0.12 [0.03-0.45]). Even without adhering to the sedentary guidelines, each additional hour of reduced sedentary time significantly lowered mortality rates among smokers (all-cause: P < .0001, CVD: P = .0064). This study highlighted that PA and SB can attenuate the association between smoking and mortality, including all-cause and CVD-related mortality. For optimal health promotion, practicing smoking cessation, engaging in PA, and reducing SB are recommended simultaneously.

[PMID: 41057532] Life expectancy (LE) is essential for triage between aggressive and conservative management for all prostate cancer risk subtypes. We sought to investigate differences in how Black and Hispanic men interpret LE in treatment decision-making. We used targeted crowdsourcing to sample a cohort reflecting sociodemographics of a US prostate cancer population. Subjects completed a conjoint analysis exercise where they iteratively chose between aggressive treatment versus conservative management across levels of 4 tradeoffs-tumor risk (lives saved by aggressive treatment at 5/10/20 year); erectile dysfunction; urinary incontinence; and irritative urinary symptoms-while considering their LE as calculated by the Prostate Cancer Comorbidity Index. Multinomial conditional logistic regression compared odds of choosing aggressive vs. conservative treatment across LEs ranging from 0 to 20 years overall and across racial/ethnic subgroups. Of 2046 men, 435 (22%) were Black and 230 (11%) were Hispanic. Across all men, the odds of aggressive treatment choice increased by 17% for every 5 years of additional LE (OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.12-1.22, p < 0.001). Men were significantly more likely to choose aggressive treatment at LE > 13 y and non-aggressive treatment at LE ≤ 10 y. Among Black men, LE was not associated with treatment choice, as they consistently preferred aggressive treatment across all LE categories. Among Hispanic men, increased LE was associated with a higher likelihood of choosing aggressive treatment, with significant preference for aggressive treatment observed only when LE > 10 years. These patterns remained consistent when further stratified by tumor risk. LE had no impact on treatment decisions in Black men, in contrast to other races and ethnicities. Future research is needed to identify reasons for this phenomenon and to inform culturally relevant approaches to communicating competing mortality risks.

[PMID: 41029167] Colorectal cancer (CRC) constitutes a significant public health burden in both China and the United States of America (USA), with low physical activity (LPA) identified as a key modifiable risk factor. This study aimed to characterize temporal trends in CRC burden attributable to LPA in these 2 nations from 1990 to 2021. Using data from the 2021 global burden of disease database, age and sex-specific disparities in CRC burden attributed to LPA were evaluated in both countries. Trend analyses of age-standardized mortality rates and age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates were performed using joinpoint regression. Decomposition analysis was applied to disentangle contributions from demographic aging, population growth, and epidemiological transitions. The age-period-cohort model was employed to quantify the independent effects of age, period, and birth cohort. Bayesian age-period-cohort modeling was utilized to project future CRC burden attributed to LPA through 2036. In 2021, LPA-attributable CRC mortality cases in China reached 16,698 (95% uncertainty interval: 10,065-24,626), exhibiting a 191.16% increase from 1990. The number of disability-adjusted life years attributed to LPA totaled 3,20,464 (95% uncertainty interval: 1,92,275-4,74,070), reflecting a 149.67% rise over the same period. Conversely, the USA reported more moderate increases of 18.26% in LPA-attributable CRC deaths and 20.28% in disability-adjusted life years. The age-period-cohort model revealed that the disease burden in both countries is shifting towards younger age groups. Further analysis of each state in the USA revealed that in 2021, the burden on low-income groups was heavier. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model predicts that the burden of CRC caused by LPA in the 2 countries will show a significant upward trend by 2036. As the burden of CRC caused by LPA becomes increasingly severe in China and the USA, there is an urgent need to raise public awareness about how physical activity can help prevent CRC and for policymakers to create targeted public health policies to lower this disease burden.

[PMID: 41019083] Air pollution may crosstalk with immune system to promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, but its precise mechanisms and prognostic significance remain unclear. This study aims to construct a prognostic signature for HCC based on air pollutant-related immune genes (APIGs). We obtained mRNA-seq and scRNA of HCC from GEO, TCGA and ICGC. AP-related target genes were retrieved from several online databases. APIGs were obtained using WGCNA, differential gene expression analysis and immune infiltration analysis. Molecular subtypes were conducted based on APIG expression to characterize immune features. A total of 101 combinations of 10 machine learning algorithms were used to construct an APIG-based prognostic signature (APIGPS). Furthermore, we performed qRT-PCR, survival analyses, functional enrichment, immune infiltration and single-cell analyses. Subsequently, LASSO, RF, and RFE-SVM were employed to identify diagnostic genes, followed by pan-cancer analysis. We identified 19 APIGs. HCC samples were divided into 3 subtypes, with C1 exhibiting a pro-tumor immune microenvironment and poorer prognosis. APIGPS constructed by 7 APIGs (CDC25C, MELK, ATG4B, SLC2A1, CDC25B, APEX1, GLS), demonstrated robust predictive ability independent of clinical features. The biological pathway differences between APIGPS-based high- and low-risk groups involved immune responses and cell proliferation and migration. APIGPS genes had stable binding to 7 APs and were mainly expressed in macrophages, with HRG exhibiting higher macrophage abundance. CDC25C was identified as the hub gene after intersecting diagnostic genes and APIGPS genes. CDC25C was associated with survival of 10 cancers, MSI in 10 cancers, TMB in 21 cancers, and immune cell abundance in 13 cancers. We identified key APIGs and constructed a robust APIG-based prognostic signature for HCC. CDC25C was a key target through which APs impact HCC and multiple other cancers.

[PMID: 41018094] This meta-analysis was designed to compare the outcomes of preoperative exercise training versus no preoperative exercise for lung cancer patients scheduled for lung resection. Four databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and CENTRAL) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing preoperative exercise training versus no preoperative exercise for lung cancer patients scheduled for lung resection. The primary outcomes were postoperative complications and postoperative length of hospital stay. The secondary outcomes included post-intervention pulmonary function, severe postoperative complications, postoperative 30-day mortality, postoperative duration of chest tube drainage, post-intervention dyspnea, and post-intervention health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A total of 16 RCTs with 1,022 individuals were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with no preoperative exercise, preoperative exercise training significantly reduced the postoperative complications (OR = 0.33, 95%CI: 0.24 to 0.46, P < 0.0001) and postoperative length of hospital stay (95%CI: -3.11 to -1.40, P < 0.0001). In addition, preoperative exercise training significantly improved forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>%) of predicted norm values (95%CI: 5.30 to 8.10, P < 0.0001), forced vital capacity (FVC%) of predicted norm values (95%CI: 1.90 to 4.23, P < 0.0001), peak expiratory flow (PEF) (95%CI: 12.44 to 60.93, P = 0.003), and peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) (95%CI: 2.41 to 4.17, P < 0.0001), while reducing severe postoperative complications (OR = 0.35, 95%CI: 0.21 to 0.56, P < 0.0001) and post-intervention dyspnea (95%CI: -0.61 to 0.04, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), six-minute walk distance (6MWD), postoperative 30-day mortality, postoperative chest tube drainage time, and post-intervention HRQoL. This meta-analysis indicated that preoperative exercise training was effective for lung cancer patients scheduled for lung resection, potentially reducing postoperative complications and hospital stay duration, while improving post-intervention pulmonary function and exercise capacity. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42024607156.",10
Female carriers of the Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele have increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.,Apolipoprotein E4 AND female AND Alzheimer's disease AND risk,"41183252,41157904,41152649,41109864,41087722,41087452,41085172,41083880,41074912,41041548","[PMID: 41183252] Dementia and stroke are major global causes of disability, with modifiable lifestyle factors playing a significant role in their development. The updated LIfestyle for BRAin health (LIBRA2) score integrates 15 modifiable risk and protective factors to quantify lifestyle-based dementia risk, but its relationship with stroke and dementia subtypes remains unexplored. We investigated LIBRA2's association with stroke and dementia subtypes while also assessing potential interactions with genetic susceptibility. Prospective data were used from the French multicenter Three-City (3C) Study, with participants aged 65 years and older followed for up to 17 years. Weighted LIBRA2 scores at baseline were constructed based on the presence of 15 modifiable risk and protective factors, with higher scores representing higher lifestyle-based dementia risk. Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the association of LIBRA2 with incident dementia (and subtypes) and stroke, adjudicated by expert neurologist panels. Genetic susceptibility to dementia and stroke was assessed using <i>APOE</i> ε4 carriership and disease-specific genetic risk scores. Analyses included 4,731 participants for stroke (mean age 73.8 years, 60.1% female) and 4,737 participants for dementia (mean age 73.8 years, 59.9% female). One-point increases in LIBRA2 scores (theoretical range -6.1 to +25.7) were associated with increased dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08; 1.06-1.11), with a stronger association for vascular and mixed dementia (HR 1.13; 1.08-1.18) compared with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (HR 1.06; 1.03-1.09). LIBRA2 was not significantly associated with incident stroke risk (HR 1.03; 0.99-1.07). No significant interaction was found between LIBRA2 and <i>APOE</i> ε4 carriership or disease-specific genetic risk scores in relation to dementia subtypes or stroke. LIBRA2 serves as a valuable tool for assessing lifestyle-related dementia risk and its subtypes but showed no association with stroke, highlighting the potential for a stroke-specific risk reduction model. These associations were independent of genetic disease susceptibility, reinforcing the universal benefits of lifestyle modifications on dementia risk reduction. The stronger association between LIBRA2 (and some individual components) and vascular or mixed dementia, compared with AD dementia, highlights the pivotal role of vascular mechanisms in the relationship between lifestyle and brain health.

[PMID: 41157904] Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which features early olfactory dysfunction and pathology. However, how APOE ε4 interacts with age and sex to affect cellular and network function in vulnerable regions such as the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) remains unclear. In vivo recordings in awake transgenic mice were used to assess how APOE ε4, age, and sex interact to influence single-cell excitability and network activity. APOE ε4 reduces excitability in the AON; adult females show higher excitability than males, a difference that is lost with age. Excitability and network activity vary by genotype and sex, while aging consistently increases network power, underscoring their complex interplay in an AD-vulnerable circuit. APOE ε4, age, and sex interact to shape excitability and network dynamics in the anterior olfactory nucleus, a region affected early in AD. These actions may underlie early olfactory dysfunction and offer electrophysiological markers for early detection and genotype-, age-, and sex-specific interventions. This is the first study on the interactive impact of three Alzheimer's disease risk factors on anterior olfactory nucleus neural functions. Apolipoprotein E ε4 reduces neuronal excitability regardless of age and sex. Females show higher excitability than males in the adult group but not in aged group. Age increases excitability in a genotype-dependent manner. Network oscillations vary by genotype and sex but are consistently enhanced by age.

[PMID: 41152649] Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) has emerged as a non-invasive marker of glymphatic function. Preclinical studies suggest that apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, may exacerbate glymphatic dysfunction-related accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau, but human evidence is lacking. This study examined whether APOE4 moderates the relationship between glymphatic dysfunction, estimated by the ALPS index, and Aβ or tau deposition. We analyzed 423 older adults (mean age 70.5  ±  8.1 years) with varying cognitive profiles who underwent DTI to calculate the ALPS index and [<sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>C] Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) for Aβ deposition. Additionally, 132 underwent [<sup>1</sup>⁸F] AV-1451 PET for tau imaging. A significant interaction between APOE4 status and ALPS index was observed for Aβ deposition, but not for tau. A lower ALPS index was associated with higher Aβ only in APOE4-positive individuals. APOE4 enhances the association between glymphatic dysfunction and Aβ burden. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status moderates the link between analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index and cerebral beta-amyloid. Lower ALPS index is associated with higher beta-amyloid (Aβ) only in APOE4 carriers. No significant moderation by APOE4 on ALPS-tau association was found. ALPS index may offer non-invasive glymphatic marker for beta-amyloid burden.

[PMID: 41109864] In 19 114 community-dwelling older adults enrolled in the ASPREE trial, high late-life visit-to-visit blood pressure variability (BPV) was associated with increased risks of incident dementia and cognitive decline during the median 4.7 year trial period. Whether sex or apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affect these associations over longer-term follow-up is unknown. We investigated the association between BPV and long term risks of dementia and cognitive decline using data from the ASPREE-eXTension (ASPREE-XT) study (median 8.3 year follow-up for dementia, 7.3 years for cognitive decline, after BPV estimation). Long-term BPV was estimated using standard deviation (SD) of the mean systolic BPs measured at ASPREE baseline, year 1 and 2 visits. Incident dementia was an adjudicated secondary endpoint and cognitive decline was defined as ≥1.5 SD decline in score from baseline sustained on the same of one, or more, standardized cognitive tests administered annually/biennially throughout ASPREE/ASPREE-XT. Analyses were stratified a priori by sex, using sex-specific SD tertiles of systolic BPV. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression comparing the highest BPV tertile to the lowest showed increased risk of dementia (HR = 1.33, 1.10-1.61) and cognitive decline (HR = 1.17, 1.06-1.30) in males, and cognitive decline in females (HR = 1.17, 1.07-1.28). In ApoE genotyped participants (81%), females in the highest BPV tertile lacking the ɛ4 allele had increased risk of dementia (HR = 1.39; 1.04-1.84), while risk of cognitive decline was increased in both sexes lacking the ɛ4 allele (males HR = 1.25; 1.09-1.43; females HR = 1.14; 1.01-1.29). These findings suggest both sex and ApoE impact the association of high BPV with long-term cognitive changes.

[PMID: 41087722] Age and APOE ε4 are major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), while sex differences exist in disease prevalence and progression. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics can provide additional insights into brain aging and AD. To examine proteomic changes due to age, sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 along with amyloid status before clinical AD occurs, we profiled 6,175 proteins in the CSF from 994 cognitively normal individuals aged 43-91 years. We identified and replicated 2,172 age-associated, 711 sex-associated, 193 APOE ε4-associated and 1,807 amyloid-associated proteins, with extensive overlap suggesting their interplay. These CSF-specific signatures were distinct from those in plasma. Network analysis revealed two proteomic modules-M2 (age-associated, sex-associated and amyloid-associated) and M6 (age-associated and sex-associated)-which were linked to neuropsychiatric and aging-related diseases. Together, our study provides proteomic changes during the early phase of AD, which may help identify new therapeutic targets of AD.

[PMID: 41087452] The ɛ4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene stands as the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying mechanism linking APOE to the disease remains elusive. Netrin-1, has been found to inhibit Aβ production, reduce neuroinflammation, and regulate synaptic plasticity, thereby playing a role in AD. Recent reports suggest that Netrin-1 could be a key protein connecting APOE ɛ4 with Aβ and tau tangles. This study aims to investigate whether APOE regulates the expression or function of Netrin-1, thus influencing the risk of developing AD. The serum levels of Netrin-1 were notably reduced in patients with AD compared to healthy individuals, whereas interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations were higher in the AD group. patients harboring the APOE ε4 allele exhibited a more pronounced decrease in Netrin-1 compared to those with other APOE genotypes. Furthermore, a correlation was observed between Netrin-1 concentrations and APOE allelic variations. Our results imply that Netrin-1 is a key player in the cognitive decline observed in AD and potentially contributes to the APOE-driven cognitive impairment process. This association is tightly linked to inflammatory factors, suggesting that Netrin-1 may serve as a crucial biomarker for the prognosis and therapeutic intervention of AD.

[PMID: 41085172] Increased white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume is a common but non-specific finding in AD. This study investigates the effect of baseline WMH volume and APOE ε4 on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible hemorrhagic lesion emergence. We included A4 participants with 0/1 hemorrhagic lesion at baseline and >1 post-baseline MRI. We examined age, sex, amyloid, WMH, APOEε4, and cardiovascular risk as predictors of whether people would accrue ≥2 hemorrhagic lesions by their last MRI. Among 1097 individuals with 0/1 baseline lesion, 120 had at least two hemorrhagic lesions on their last MRI. Elevated baseline WMH (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, p = 0.002) and APOE ɛ4/ɛ4 (OR = 4.8, p < 0.001) independently predicted membership to this group. Both hetero- and homozygous APOE ɛ4 carriers with low WMH volume had a low risk of accumulating hemorrhagic lesions. These results support the independent consideration of WMH and APOE ɛ4 in the natural history of hemorrhagic lesion accumulation and suggest that individuals with low WMH volume have a low short-term risk, irrespective of APOE genotype. NCT02008357 HIGHLIGHTS: Elevated baseline white matter lesion volume is related to the risk of ARIA-H emergence. The effects of white matter lesion volume and APOE ɛ4 on ARIA-H are independent. APOE ɛ4 carriers with low white matter lesion volume had a low risk of ARIA-H emergence.

[PMID: 41083880] The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE ε4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for dementia. However, it remains unclear whether APOE ε4 status modulates the associations of non-genetic risk factors and dementia risk. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate this potential modulating role. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted up to June 2023. Population-based longitudinal studies were included if they reported associations of risk factors with all-cause dementia (ACD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) stratified by APOE ε4 status. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to test stratification effects by APOE ε4. A total of 170 studies (173 factors) were included, with 48 factors for meta-analyses. Meta-regression confirmed significant modification effect by APOE ε4 status for nine risk factors. Stronger associations in APOE ε4 carriers were found for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, frequent drinking, and high systolic blood pressure; in noncarriers, stronger associations were observed for light-to-moderate alcohol consumption, female sex, physical activity, diabetes, and loneliness. Diabetes specifically increased AD risk only in APOE ε4 noncarriers. Additionally, the subgroup analyses stratified by APOE ε4 status indicated that nine other factors may influence risk differentially between carriers and noncarriers, though the associations were not significant in meta-regression (vitamin E intake, heart failure, serum neurofilament light chain, serum testosterone, agitation, air NO<sub>2</sub> concentration, ever smoker, current smoker, and head injury). Evidence from the current investigation suggests that APOE ε4 defines distinct etiological pathways for dementia, underscoring the promise of genotype-tailored prevention strategies.

[PMID: 41074912] Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic changes, but its contribution to clinical features and pathology in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is less clear. Using the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center dataset, we investigated APOE ε4-associated effects on DLB core clinical features and neuropathology. In analyses of APOE ε4 carriers, dosage, and genetic risk score, APOE ε4 was associated with lower odds of fluctuating cognition and parkinsonism and higher odds of visual hallucinations. APOE ε4 was associated with greater neocortical Lewy body pathology, partially mediated by AD co-pathology. The severity of fluctuating cognition was associated with Lewy body pathology stage after controlling for AD co-pathology. Visual hallucinations were associated with both Lewy body and AD pathologies. Core clinical features of DLB are sensitive to APOE haplotype. Targeting APOE biology may elucidate DLB pathogenesis and inform therapeutic development. Core clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies were sensitive to apolipoprotein E (APOE) haplotype. APOE ε4 was associated with a higher likelihood of hallucinations yet a lower likelihood of cognitive fluctuations. APOE ε4 was associated with greater severity of Lewy body pathology, partially mediated by Alzheimer's disease (AD) co-pathology. Whereas fluctuating cognition was primarily linked to Lewy body pathology, visual hallucinations were associated with both Lewy body and AD neuropathologic changes.

[PMID: 41041548] Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) genotype, hypertension, and biological sex are critical risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Yet, their combined impact on early cerebrovascular dysfunction, brain inflammation, and memory impairment remains poorly understood. We developed a translational mouse model incorporating human ApoE4, hypertension via angiotensin II infusion, and induced accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) to mimic perimenopause in females to investigate these interactions. Hypertensive ApoE4 mice of both sexes exhibited impaired spatial working memory, decreased cerebral blood flow, increased neuroinflammation, and decreased blood brain barrier integrity, recapitulating key early clinical features observed in human populations with these risk factors. Brain blood flow reduction was associated with an increased incidence of capillary stalling, with notable sex differences in the extent and cellular composition of stalls: in males, stalling was strongly elevated and mostly due to red blood cell arrest, while stalling was modestly elevated in peri-AOF females with most stalls including leukocytes. Treatment with prasugrel, a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, improved memory performance in both sexes but was correlated with different physiological effects - restored cerebral blood flow in males and reduced microglia motility and inflammation in peri-AOF females. Platelet depletion mimicked prasugrel's blood flow and cognitive benefits in males, while microglia depletion selectively rescued memory in females. Our work emphasizes the necessity of including translationally relevant female mouse models in neurodegenerative disease studies, and our findings highlight the importance of risk profile-specific interventions and demonstrate that early vascular dysfunction may be a key, sex-dependent driver of cognitive decline.",10

This study provides a single-cell transcriptomic profile of mouse immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout pregnancy and assesses the similarities and differences between these immune cells and human decidual immune cells. Homeostasis of the immune microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface is essential for pregnancy. Immune cell heterogeneity at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnant mice remains understudied. Here, we perform in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analysis with 120,238 maternal-fetal single cells of mice from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E18.5 and in vitro experiments to establish an immune cell atlas. Macrophages constitute the largest population, with some subsets resembling human counterparts, and the number of Ccr2 + macrophages in the decidua increases as pregnancy progresses. Neutrophils constitute the second largest population, and Ifit1 + N2 neutrophils are localized close to the implantation site during early pregnancy. Three NK cell subsets were identified, including the previously reported NK1.1 - subset. In combination with in vitro experiments, the presence of T and B cells within the decidua was validated. Our work profiles a comprehensive immune cell atlas of the mouse maternal-fetal interface, offering a valuable reference for further investigations.

[PMID: 41186980] In Lebanon, disadvantaged pregnant women show poor maternal outcomes due to limited access to antenatal care (ANC) and a strained health care system, compounded by ongoing conflicts and a significant refugee population. Despite substantial efforts to improve maternal health, the provision of maternal health services in primary health care centers (PHCs) still faces significant challenges. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, particularly those using artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification, are proving effective in addressing gaps in maternal health services by offering scalable and accessible care. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an AI-based gamified intervention, Gamification and Artificial Intelligence and mHealth Network for Maternal Health Improvement (GAIN MHI), on maternal health outcomes and uptake of ANC services among disadvantaged populations in Lebanon. The study was a community interventional trial with historical controls, conducted across 19 randomly allocated PHCs in 5 Lebanese governorates. Participants included pregnant women in their first trimester visiting PHCs. The intervention used mHealth tools, including educational mobile-based messages, appointment reminders, and the GAIN MHI app, which provided AI-driven and gamified learning for health care providers (HCPs). Data collected covered demographics, medical history, and maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Key outcome measures included uptake of health care services (eg, ANC visits, supplement intake, ultrasound completion, lab tests) and maternal and neonatal outcomes (eg, term delivery, normal delivery, abortion rate, neonatal morbidity, maternal complications). This study included 3989 participants, divided between a control group (n=1993, 50%) and an intervention group (n=1996, 50%). Regression models adjusting for demographics, health, and obstetric characteristics showed significantly higher odds in the intervention group for completing 4 or more ANC visits (odds ratio [OR] 1.569, 95% CI 1.329-1.852, P<.05), completing lab tests (OR 1.821, 95% CI 1.514-2.191, P<.05), 2 or more ultrasound screenings (OR 7.984, 95% CI 6.687-9.523, P<.05), urine analysis (OR 4.399, 95% CI 3.631-5.330, P<.05), and supplement intake (OR 3.508, 95% CI 2.982-4.128, P<.05). Regarding outcomes, the intervention group had 29.5% increased odds of a term delivery (OR 1.295, 95% CI 1.095-1.532, P=.002) and 58% increased odds of avoiding neonatal morbidity (OR 1.580, 95% CI 1.185-2.108, P=.002). However, both groups showed decreased odds of normal delivery (intervention: OR 0.774, 95% CI 0.657-0.911; control: OR 0.823, 95% CI 0.701-0.964) and increased odds of maternal complications (intervention: OR 0.535, 95% CI 0.449-0.637; control: OR 0.586, 95% CI 0.474-0.723; P<.05). The GAIN MHI intervention effectively improves uptake of ANC and maternal and neonatal outcomes. Our findings highlight the potential of mHealth interventions to enhance health care delivery. To sustain these improvements, future research should focus on integrating mHealth with other interventions that address socioeconomic and contextual factors. This approach will further optimize maternal and neonatal health outcomes among disadvantaged populations.

[PMID: 41186948] Advanced imaging to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE) during pregnancy increases costs, ionizing radiation exposure, and the risk of overdiagnosis. D-dimer testing can exclude PE and compression ultrasonography can diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), both reducing advanced imaging needs. How these 2 strategies are used in community PE diagnostics is unknown. To analyze the use and efficiencies of D-dimer and ultrasonography for the diagnosis of antenatal PE. This retrospective cohort study was performed in 21 US community hospitals from October 1, 2021, to March 31, 2023. Participants included pregnant patients who underwent D-dimer testing, compression ultrasonography, or advanced imaging for suspected PE. D-dimer testing or ultrasonography. The main outcome was avoidance of advanced imaging, measured by the number needed to test (NNT) to avoid 1 advanced imaging study using low to intermediate D-dimer values or a positive ultrasonography finding. Variables associated with D-dimer and ultrasonography were evaluated using quasi-Poisson regression reported as adjusted relative risks (ARRs). A total of 720 outpatient encounters in 699 patients were included in the analysis (median age, 30.2 [IQR, 24.3-36.1] years). D-dimer testing was obtained in 524 patients (72.8%). Advanced imaging was not pursued in 149 of 155 patients (96.1%) with low (<0.5 mg/L) and 82 of 179 (45.8%) with intermediate (0.5 to <1.0 mg/L) D-dimer values, yielding an NNT to avoid 1 advanced imaging study of 2.3 (95% CI, 2.0-2.6). No 90-day venous thromboembolism or death occurred following rule-outs. D-dimer testing was less commonly used in third (vs first) trimester (ARR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97); with unilateral signs or symptoms of DVT (vs none) (ARR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.82), and during labor and delivery unit (vs emergency department) evaluation (ARR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20-0.35). Compression ultrasonography was performed in 229 patients (31.8%), with DVT diagnosed in 3 (1.3%). Advanced imaging was not pursued in 2 of these patients, yielding an NNT to avoid 1 advanced imaging study of 115 (95% CI, 32-417). Ultrasonography use and results varied by DVT symptoms. Among 55 patients with DVT symptoms, 46 (83.6%) underwent ultrasonography, with positive findings in 3 (yield of 6.5%). Among 665 patients without symptoms, 183 (27.5%) underwent ultrasonography, with negative findings in all (yield of 0). In this cohort study, use of D-dimer testing was efficient and safe with opportunities for expansion across settings and patients. These findings suggest that ultrasonography efficiency was low but could be improved with symptom-driven use in antenatal PE diagnostics.

[PMID: 41186786] Antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli (E. coli) poses a major public health threat. This study introduces a fractional-order differential equation model incorporating memory effects to analyze resistance and susceptibility dynamics in E. coli populations exposed to Ertapenem, Imipenem, and Meropenem, using real-world data from 2018 to 2023 from a hospital in Northern Cyprus. The model accounts for genetic mutations, horizontal gene transfer, and the decay of resistance. Results indicate a gradual increase in resistance, with higher fractional orders slowing growth rates. Basic reproduction number analysis identifies thresholds for resistance persistence or decline, suggesting that reducing mutation rates and enhancing decay factors can control resistance. Projections forecast an 800% rise in resistance cases by 2030 compared to 2018, underscoring the need for optimized antibiotic stewardship.

[PMID: 41186780] The widespread use of pesticides such as deltamethrin (a pyrethroid) and acetamiprid (a neonicotinoid) has sparked concerns regarding their effects on human health, particularly their potential role in carcinogenesis. This study investigated the cytotoxic, molecular, and functional effects of these pesticides, individually and in combination, on the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line. This model was chosen to specifically investigate estrogen recpetor (ER)-independent mechanisms due to its expression of targets such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER); however, it does not reflect normal mammary cell responses. Cytotoxicity was assessed via XTT assays, migration was analyzed using wound-healing assays, and gene expression changes in AhR, PPARγ, and Caspase-3 were measured using RT-qPCR. Molecular docking was performed to predict pesticide-protein interactions, and in silico toxicity assessments using ProTox-II supplemented the in vitro results by predicting toxicity profiles relevant to public health. Both pesticides exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity, and their combination produced an additive effect on cell viability. Importantly, suppression of cell migration and downregulation of AhR and PPARγ expression reflected toxic stress responses at high pesticide concentrations, rather than therapeutic or anti-cancer potential. While apoptosis-related gene expression (Caspase-3) was increased, this effect did not reach statistical significance. Molecular docking supported strong interactions with key pathways related to xenobiotic metabolism and apoptosis. These findings emphasize that, at high and non-environmentally relevant concentrations, deltamethrin and acetamiprid induce additive cytotoxic effects and disrupt molecular processes in a mechanistic cancer model. The results highlight the need for further investigation using normal cell systems and environmentally relevant exposures to clarify real-world risk and biological mechanisms, and should not be interpreted as evidence of therapeutic activity. This study underscores the mechanistic relevance of pesticide exposure in environmental toxicology rather than any potential therapeutic application.

[PMID: 41186742] Pathological examination, the current gold standard for differentiating eyelid basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC), is invasive, time-consuming, and often inaccessible in primary care hospitals. Therefore, a non-invasive, early differential diagnostic method for eyelid BCC and SGC is needed to reduce diagnostic delays and improve accuracy, which holds significant clinical value, especially for Asian populations. Using 199 eyelid BCC and 171 eyelid SGC photographic images from Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (2016-2022), we developed a ResNet50-based deep learning model. The model's performance was evaluated using classification accuracy and the F1 score and was compared with that of four ophthalmologists (three junior and one senior). To assess its clinical utility, we further evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ophthalmologists with and without the model's assistance. The developed model achieved a differential diagnosis accuracy of 0.892 (95% CI 0.821-0.937), with a sensitivity of 0.863 (95% CI 0.743-0.932) and a specificity of 0.917 (95% CI 0.819-0.964), outperforming all four ophthalmologists (junior: 0.703 (95% CI 0.612-0.780), 0.757 (95% CI 0.669-0.827), 0.811 (95% CI 0.729-0.873); senior: 0.874 (95% CI 0.799-0.923)). With the model's assistance, diagnostic accuracy improved by 14.1%, 16.6%, and 2.2% for junior ophthalmologists and by 1.0% for the senior ophthalmologist. The developed model accurately differentiates eyelid BCC and SGC and effectively improves diagnostic performance, particularly for junior ophthalmologists. It may facilitate timely and appropriate treatment planning in clinical settings for eyelid BCC and SGC patients.

[PMID: 41186616] To evaluate early outcomes of infants with gastroschisis managed at a UK tertiary centre over 16 years, focusing on associations between maternal factors, closure techniques, and postoperative outcomes. A retrospective cohort study included 126 live-born infants with intra-operatively confirmed gastroschisis (June 2008-June 2024). Data on maternal demographics, perinatal factors, surgical management, and outcomes were collected. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for gestational age, birth weight, gastroschisis complexity, and maternal smoking. Antenatal ultrasound identified 98% of cases. Median gestational age was 37 weeks; mean birth weight was 2.4 kg. Sutureless closure was used in 41% of cases and showed a trend toward earlier feeding and shorter hospital stay, though differences were not statistically significant. However, sutureless closure was associated with higher rates of sepsis (73% vs. 41%, p = 0.005) and hernia formation (42% vs. 22%, p = 0.01). Maternal smoking independently increased neonatal sepsis risk (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.0). Overall survival was 96.8%, with all deaths occurring in complex cases. While sutureless closure may offer perioperative advantages, it is associated with increased postoperative morbidity. Maternal smoking is a modifiable risk factor for neonatal sepsis. Individualised surgical approaches and targeted maternal interventions are recommended.

[PMID: 41186511] Hysteroscopic myomectomy is a common procedure for treating submucosal leiomyomas, but fluid overload and subsequent pulmonary edema are significant complications. This study investigates whether phenylephrine-induced increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) can reduce pulmonary edema and distension fluid absorption in patients undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 44 patients scheduled for hysteroscopic myomectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either phenylephrine infusion to maintain MAP at 100%-120% of the baseline value or normal saline infusion during surgery. The primary outcome was the incidence of pulmonary edema assessed by lung ultrasound (LUS). Secondary outcomes included B-line scores, thoracic fluid content (TFC), distension fluid deficit, use of furosemide, and so on. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed in distention fluid deficit, andΔTFC to predict pulmonary edema. The phenylephrine group showed a significantly lower incidence of pulmonary edema (18.2% vs. 54.6%, RR = 0.33, 95%CI [0.13 to 0.81], P = 0.027) and lower LUS B-line scores (MD = - 4.5, 95%CI [0 to 9], P = 0.016) compared to the control group. Additionally, the phenylephrine group had significantly reduced distension fluid deficit (P = 0.018), lower TFC at the end of operation (P = 0.008), and decreased use of furosemide (P = 0.022). Best cut-off value in diagnosis pulmonary edema were 1900 ml for distention fluid deficit, and 7.1/kΩ for ΔTFC and area under the ROC curve were 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. Phenylephrine administration during hysteroscopic myomectomy effectively reduces pulmonary edema and distension fluid absorption by increasing MAP. This study provides evidence for a new strategy in intraoperative fluid management for hysteroscopic surgeries.

[PMID: 41186466] Background Assessing nipple involvement in breast cancer at preoperative imaging is crucial for nipple-preserving surgery, but no studies have investigated the utility of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) in this assessment. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CEM in ruling in pathologic nipple involvement and identify associated CEM features. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer treated with primary surgery who underwent preoperative CEM at five referral centers between December 2016 and December 2023. After local image review by board-certified breast radiologists (with ≥5 years of experience), CEM diagnostic accuracy indexes to rule in nipple involvement (specificity [ie, primary end point], positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratio) were calculated with surgical pathologic findings serving as the reference standard. Associations of CEM features with pathologic nipple involvement and the minimum enhancement-to-nipple distance to rule in pathologic nipple involvement were evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratios [ORs]) and the Youden index. Results Pathologic nipple involvement was present in 147 of 558 (26.3%) cancers from 530 included women (median age, 63.7 years; IQR, 50.4-73.6 years). CEM specificity was 95.1% (391 of 411; 95% CI: 92.6, 97.0), with a positive predictive value of 83.5% (101 of 121; 95% CI: 76.5, 88.7) and a positive likelihood ratio of 14.1 (95% CI: 9.1, 22.0). CEM features associated with pathologic nipple involvement were as follows: periareolar skin thickening (OR, 3.8; 95% CI: 1.7, 8.4; <i>P</i> < .001), disrupted superficial linear enhancement (OR, 3.0; 95% CI: 1.3, 7.0; <i>P</i> = .01), nipple retraction (OR, 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.6; <i>P</i> = .03), and (with lower odds) 1-mm increases in the minimum enhancement-to-nipple distance (OR, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.96; <i>P</i> < .001). For the minimum enhancement-to-nipple distance, a 9.5-mm cutoff best predicted pathologic nipple involvement (Youden index, 0.53). Conclusion CEM was able to help accurately rule in pathologic nipple involvement in the preoperative setting. <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> © RSNA, 2025.

[PMID: 41186205] Endometritis is a highly prevalent reproductive disorder in cows, causing serious adverse effects on reproductive performance, which brings huge economic losses to the livestock industry. Staphylococcus aureus is detected in a high proportion of endometritis pathogens (alone or in combinations of infections). Uterine microbial composition plays an important role in endometritis. In order to determine the role of S. aureus in endometritis, we established an endometritis model using this bacterium and utilized metagenomics to detect the structure and function of the bovine uterine microbiota. We found that S. aureus infection significantly increased the relative abundance of bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, and Streptococcus spp., while reducing the relative abundance of Akkermansia and Prevotella bacteria. The functions of microorganisms in the uterus are mainly manifested in metabolic levels, including carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism processes. The number of genes continues to increase with the duration of S. aureus infection, which disrupts the balance that maintains the bovine uterine flora. This study provides a descriptive analysis of changes in the uterine microbiota of cows infected with S. aureus, which contributes to a new understanding of uncultured or unidentified pathogenic bacteria.",10
Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against atherosclerosis by modulating adiponectin and SREBP2 levels.,FGF21 AND atherosclerosis AND adiponectin AND SREBP2,"26872317,41187382,41187309,41187302,41187245,41187172,41187099,41186823,41186741,41186740","[PMID: 26872317] The serum total and LDL cholesterol levels of long-term vegans tend to be very low. The characteristically low ratio of saturated to unsaturated fat in vegan diets, and the absence of cholesterol in such diets, clearly contribute to this effect. But there is reason to suspect that the quantity and composition of dietary protein also play a role in this regard. Vegan diets of moderate protein intake tend to be relatively low in certain essential amino acids, and as a result may increase hepatic activity of the kinase GCN2, which functions as a gauge of amino acid status. GCN2 activation boosts the liver's production of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a factor which favorably affects serum lipids and metabolic syndrome. The ability of FGF21 to decrease LDL cholesterol has now been traced to at least two mechanisms: a suppression of hepatocyte expression of sterol response element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), which in turn leads to a reduction in cholesterol synthesis; and up-regulated expression of hepatocyte LDL receptors, reflecting inhibition of a mechanism that promotes proteasomal degradation of these receptors. In mice, the vascular benefits of FGF21 are also mediated by favorable effects on adipocyte function - most notably, increased adipocyte secretion of adiponectin, which directly exerts anti-inflammatory effects on the vasculature which complement the concurrent reduction in LDL particles in preventing or reversing atherosclerosis. If, as has been proposed, plant proteins preferentially stimulate glucagon secretion owing to their amino acid composition, this would represent an additional mechanism whereby plant protein promotes FGF21 activity, as glucagon acts on the liver to boost transcription of the FGF21 gene.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187309] Cardiovascular disorders are closely linked to metabolic syndrome and remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, despite advances in early detection and treatment. Adipokines, cardiokines, and myokines play critical roles in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis. In this study, we measured serum levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), irisin, and adiponectin in 243 male patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. We investigated the associations of these biomarkers with coronary artery disease (CAD) and their correlation with metabolic syndrome status. FSTL1 levels were predicted using a Particle Swarm Optimization-enhanced Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (PSO-ANFIS) based on artificial intelligence. Patients with CAD exhibited significantly lower FABP4 levels (p<0.0001), and low FABP4 levels emerged as an independent predictor of CAD in logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 0.903, 95% CI 0.825-0.987, p=0.025). The combination of adiponectin, FSTL1, and irisin as a biomarker strategy demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96). Both FSTL1 and adiponectin independently correlated with metabolic syndrome (p<0.001, odds ratio 1.039, 95% CI 1.025-1.054; p<0.001, odds ratio 0.979, 95% CI 0.971-0.988, respectively). The prediction of FSTL1 levels using PSO-ANFIS supports the concept of harmonization among metabolic messengers. These findings underscore the potential of FABP4 and FSTL1 as valuable biomarkers for diagnosing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, thereby facilitating personalized interventions targeting organokine pathways.

[PMID: 41187302] Major adverse cardiovascular events resulting from atherosclerotic plaque instability account for a plurality of deaths worldwide despite the use of highly effective lipid lowering therapies. Over the last three decades, the role of inflammation in atherogenesis has been tested extensively. Although preclinical studies demonstrate a clear role for inflammation in atherogenesis, clinical studies using global anti-inflammatory therapies have not been as successful as hoped, encouraging the search for new therapeutic strategies. Thanks to the advent of cell-specific lineage tracing, we have begun to appreciate the multifaceted role of smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching in modulating plaque stability. Here, we review the mechanisms controlling smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching during early and late-stage pathogenesis, which may inspire future therapies to stabilize plaques.

[PMID: 41187245] Identifying the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a cornerstone of preventive medical care. Despite its significance, limited research has explored ASCVD risk in individuals with fibrotic skin diseases. This study aims to evaluate the risk of ASCVD in patients diagnosed with fibrotic skin conditions. We utilized the TriNetX platform to analyze ASCVD risk associated with fibrotic skin conditions. Propensity score-matched (PSM) cohorts were constructed to adjust for confounding. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Patients with fibrotic skin diseases demonstrated an elevated risk of ASCVD. Scleroderma was most strongly associated with ASCVD risk (HR 2.51 [95% CI: 1.97,3.21]), followed by hypertrophic scar (HR 1.40 [95% CI: 1.20,1.63]). Elevated risks were also observed for morphea (HR 1.36 [95% CI: 1.03,1.08]) and lichen sclerosis (HR 1.30 [95% CI: 1.04,1.62]). Individuals with fibrotic skin conditions, including scleroderma, hypertrophic scars, morphea, and lichen sclerosis, demonstrate an increased risk of ASCVD. These findings highlight the significance of recognizing fibrotic skin diseases as possible indicators of systemic inflammation.

[PMID: 41187172] Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition among older adults, particularly those in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Supervised exercise is a key treatment for PAD-related claudication, but access to such programs is limited, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth interventions offer a promising alternative, but their feasibility and effectiveness in these populations remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a home-based telehealth intervention combining exercise and behaviour change counselling for patients with PAD from socioeconomically deprived areas of the UK. A pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with PAD patients (n = 36) recruited from the Vascular Unit of Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Participants were randomly assigned to either a telehealth intervention group (n = 19) or a control group (n = 17). The intervention consisted of weekly phone-based behaviour change counselling and twice-weekly virtual supervised exercise sessions for 12 weeks. Primary feasibility outcomes included recruitment, retention, and adherence. Secondary outcomes assessed functional capacity, quality of life, smoking and alcohol use, and dietary habits. Of the 102 eligible patients, 36 were recruited, falling short of the target recruitment goal of 60 participants. The intervention group attended a median of 20 supervised exercise sessions (max 24) and 11 sessions with the health improvement practitioner (max 12). Exploratory analyses suggested improvements in subjective functional capacity, as measured by walking speed and stair-climbing ability (P < 0.01), and quality of life (P < 0.01) in the intervention group compared to the control group. A 50% smoking cessation rate was observed among baseline smokers in the intervention group, while no changes were observed in the control group. No significant differences were observed between groups in objective functional capacity (as measured by the 6-minute walk test), alcohol intake, or dietary quality. This digitally delivered, home-based telehealth intervention was feasible for PAD patients in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Exploratory findings suggest potential benefits in subjective function capacity and health behaviours; however, the study was not powered to evaluate effectiveness, and findings should be interpreted with caution. These data support the suitability of outcome measures and provide essential insights for designing a fully powered definitive trial to evaluate long-term clinical outcomes.

[PMID: 41187099] Panvascular disease, defined by the systemic involvement of multiple vascular beds, poses a growing challenge to contemporary diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms. Despite organ-specific manifestations, these conditions share a convergent pathological basis driven by chronic low-grade inflammation, immune dysregulation, and maladaptive vascular remodeling. Within this immunovascular interface, complement C3 (C3) has emerged as a pivotal regulator. Positioned at the convergence of the classical, lectin, and alternative complement pathways, C3 integrates systemic immune cues with microenvironmental stimuli to orchestrate endothelial activation, smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching, immune cell recruitment, platelet activation, and fibroinflammatory remodeling. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of C3 biology, including its structural domains, activation cascades, and downstream effector functions. We examine the role of C3 across major vascular cell types, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, innate and adaptive immune cells, platelets, and fibroblasts, highlighting how C3 signaling dynamically shapes both acute injury responses and chronic vascular adaptation. In disease-specific contexts, we delineate how C3 contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysm and dissection, hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and autoimmune- associated vasculitides. Special emphasis is placed on the dual-phase roles of C3, such as its injuryexacerbating effects in the acute phase of stroke versus its reparative functions in neuroregeneration. Finally, we review emerging therapeutic strategies targeting C3, with a focus on compstatin-based inhibitors, their pharmacological profiles, clinical trial progress, and immunological safety considerations. Collectively, this review reframes C3 as a master orchestrator of panvascular pathology and a promising target for precision immunomodulation across vascular systems.

[PMID: 41186823] The study examined implication of miRNA-19b carried by endothelial microparticles (EMPs) in phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and the mechanisms underlying this transformation. The functions of miRNA-19b were assessed by phenotypic switching, proliferation, and migration of VSMCs. The target genes of miR-19b associated with proliferation and migration were revealed by analysis of TargetScan and miRanda databases and verified with luciferase assay. Experiments showed that EMPs could transfer miRNA-19b into VSMCs. Elevated content of miRNA-19b increased expression of contractile phenotypic markers SMA and SM22α and inhibited proliferation and migration of VSMCs. The direct target gene of miRNA-19b turned out to be the mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6). Thus, miRNA-19b in EMPs could inhibit phenotypic transformation of VSMCs from the contractile phenotype to synthetic one and reduce proliferation and migration by down-regulating MAPK6 expression, which can potentially inhibit the development of atherosclerosis.

[PMID: 41186740] Despite advances in therapeutic strategies a significant proportion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients experience early coronary artery disease (CAD) progression, particularly those with diabetes. To evaluate CAD progression in diabetic patients treated with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ra) over 1 year after an ACS. Patients presenting with non-ST-elevation ACS between 2019 and 2022 were enrolled in a prospective registry and underwent serial coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) at baseline (after revascularization, during the index hospitalization) and at 1-year follow-up. The primary endpoint was the absolute change (1 year - baseline) in non-culprit lesion plaque burden (ΔPB) on CCTA, with the absolute change in patient percent atheroma volume (ΔPAV) as a key secondary endpoint. A comprehensive lipidomic, metabolomic, and proteomic plasma assessment was also performed in all GLP-1Ra-treated patients and four randomly selected controls. Of 28 diabetic patients, 7 (25%) with 22 coronary plaques were treated with GLP-1Ra, and 21 (75%) with 65 plaques received other antidiabetic agents. In the 1-year observation frame, both ΔPB (-5.8 ± 12.8% vs. -1.1 ± 13.6%, p = 0.041) and ΔPAV (-6.1% [-7.3, -1.8] vs. -0.7% [-2.4, 9.8], p = 0.039) were significantly lower in GLP-1Ra-treated patients. Total atheroma volume also showed a numerically greater reduction in the GLP-1Ra cohort (0.7 mm³ [-2.5-8.7] vs. 25.0 mm³ [4.8-39.7]), primarily due to a decrease in plaque fibrofatty volume percentage (-2.9 ± 10.1% vs. 1.0 ± 6.8%, p = 0.042). Lipidomic, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses identified reductions in monoacylglycerols and triacylglycerols, increases in diacylglycerols and phosphatidylethanolamine, a shift from carbohydrate metabolism toward lipid metabolism and hormone regulation, and differential expression of proteins involved in complement activation, endothelial function, and cytoskeletal organization in GLP-1Ra-treated patients compared with controls. In diabetic patients with ACS, GLP-1Ra therapy was associated with a significant regression in coronary plaque burden at 1 year, supported by favorable lipidomic, metabolomic, and proteomic changes. These findings suggest a potential role for GLP-1Ra in modifying atherosclerosis progression beyond glycemic control.",10

The mechanistic link between proteinuria and progression remains elusive. Proximal tubule epithelial cells(PTEC) retrieve albumin in the glomerular filtrate via receptor mediated endocytosis facilitated by megalin-cubilin complex. We reported that cell-survival protein, Akt, phosphorylates cargo binding endocytic adaptor protein to megalin, disabled-2(Dab2). We hypothesize that downregulation of Akt signaling as a result of overwhelmed endocytic machinery in albumin overload is linked to PTEC apoptosis in proteinuric states. We show that cell culture and animal model of albumin overload inhibited phosphorylation of Akt in association with apoptosis in PTEC. Chemical inhibition and overexpression of Akt by constitutively active Akt plasmid exacerbated and alleviated apoptosis respectively in response to albumin overload in PTEC. Mouse with targeted inhibition of Akt1 and Akt2 in PTEC (Akt1/2lox/loxSGLT2cre) displayed perturbed albumin endocytosis at baseline. Albumin overload in Akt1/2 <sup>lox/lox</sup> SGLT2cre mouse led to dephosphorylation and translocation downstream Akt target, Forkhead box O-1 (Foxo1) to nuclei driving transcriptional activation of proapoptotic BIM followed by translocation of proapoptotic Bax and BIM to mitochondria and cytochrome-c to cytosol. In an effort to investigate the role of Akt in progression, we examined kidney biopsy specimens of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease. Kidney biopsies of patients with FSGS exhibited decreased pSer473-Akt expression in PTEC early in the course of disease, preceding progression to end stage kidney disease. We conclude that downstream dephosphorylation of Foxo and transcriptional activation of BIM and subsequent mitochondrial injury drives apoptosis following Akt downregulation in PTEC albeit inhibition of albumin endocytosis in proteinuric states.

[PMID: 41151691] Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a reproductive disorder characterized by the early loss of ovarian function in women under 40 years of age. PFAS, especially PFOA and PFOS, have been implicated in ovarian dysfunction, but their mechanisms of action remain unclear. In this study, an integrative network toxicology approach was applied, combining target prediction, gene enrichment analysis, machine learning based feature selection, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, with transcriptomic validation using the GSE127453 dataset. 83 overlapping targets between PFAS and POI were identified. GO enrichment analysis indicated significant involvement in nuclear receptor mediated transcriptional regulation, including steroid hormone receptor and estrogen receptor signalin, KEGG analysis highlighted pathways related to progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, cellular senescence, and the FoxO signaling pathway, implying dual toxicological mechanisms involving impaired oocyte development and accelerated ovarian cell aging. Eight core genes were identified, including SHBG, CDC25A, TPO, BMP2, MAPK1, CASP3, CDK2, and ESR1. Among them, BMP2, CDK2, SHBG, and TPO were downregulated, while CASP3 and ESR1 were upregulated in POI samples. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed stable, high affinity interactions between PFAS and CASP3, supporting a potential role in apoptosis activation. Nonetheless, further in vitro, in vivo, and mixture-based studies are warranted to substantiate these computational predictions and clarify dose-response relationships.

[PMID: 41137300] This study investigates the potential mechanism of Xiezhuo Yishen Decoction (XYD) in the treatment of uric acid nephropathy (UAN). The active components and targets of XYD were determined via the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform, and the target proteins were chosen through the Uniprot database. GeneCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and Drugbank were utilized to identify gene targets associated with UAN, whereas Venny 2.1.0 was employed to determine the common intersections between medication targets and disease targets. Cytoscape 3.7.1 was employed to map the network of active substances in Traditional Chinese medicine and their potential targets, while the protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the String database and Cytoscape software to identify critical target proteins. Gene ontology annotation analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis were performed using R version 4.0.0 software . A total of 206 active components were identified from the XYD, of which 62 were recognized as possible therapeutic targets. We screened out 31 key targets by the protein-protein interaction network. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed 81 biological processes, 14 cellular components, and 96 molecular functions. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analysis showed that 199 pathways were significantly enriched, whose functions were mainly involved in immune system, endocrine system, cell death and autophagy, and other biological processes. The molecular docking data indicated that the binding energy between the active components of XYD and the major targets exhibited significant binding affinity. The mechanism of XYD in treating UAN involves multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways, including participating in lipid metabolism, inhibiting inflammation, regulating apoptosis and autophagy. The study also found that FOXO signal pathway may be a potential pathway for treating UAN. Additionally, a novel therapeutic approach for UAN has been established, targeting various signaling pathways.

[PMID: 41021160] Hyperoside (Hyp) exerts considerable inhibitory effects on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of Hyp in the treatment of NSCLC using a combination of network pharmacology and in vitro experiments. Active targets of Hyp and NSCLC-related targets were identified using public databases. The therapeutic targets were predicted based on the intersection of drug and disease targets. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING and Cytoscape, and key network modules and targets were identified through network topology analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID. Molecular docking between Hyp and therapeutic targets was performed using AutoDock Vina software. These results were further verified by in vitro experiments of A549 cell lines, including the CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, flow cytometry and western blotting. A total of 30 therapeutic targets of Hyp against NSCLC were identified. Analysis of the PPI network revealed a key network module and five key targets: MMP9, CASP3, MAPK1, ESR1, and EGFR. These targets were related to cell proliferation and migration, apoptosis, and oxidative stress and may play a role through the FoxO, MAPK, Rap1, Ras, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Molecular docking results showed a strong binding affinity between Hyp and most therapeutic targets. Further experiments confirmed that Hyp inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of A549 cells by regulating the EGFR/ERK/FOXO1 signaling pathway. Hyp may be a promising drug for treating NSCLC (especially lung adenocarcinoma), and its therapeutic mechanisms is closely related to the regulation of EGFR/ERK/FOXO1 pathway.

[PMID: 41011591] Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, where conventional chemotherapy is often limited by severe side effects and drug resistance. Ginsenosides, the primary bioactive triterpenoid saponins isolated from the root of Panax ginseng C. A. Mey, have demonstrated potential in combating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their efficacy under nutrient-deficient conditions remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ginsenosides on the growth and death of lung cancer cells under low-nutrient conditions and to explore the underlying mechanisms. A549 cells were divided into two groups: one cultured in 10% serum and another under serum-free conditions, followed by treatment with ginsenosides CK, Rh2(S), and Rg3(S) for 24 h. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using a CCK-8 assay, Calcein/PI fluorescence staining, Hoechst 33258 staining, and flow cytometry. Potential targets and signaling pathways of ginsenosides were predicted using network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses. The mRNA expression of key genes was measured by qRT-PCR, and mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using JC-1 staining. The results showed that ginsenosides induced dose-dependent apoptosis in serum-starved A549 cells. Bioinformatics analysis suggested the involvement of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO signaling pathway, which was supported by decreased Akt mRNA levels and increased FoxO mRNA expression. Furthermore, mRNA levels of Bim, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 were significantly upregulated, accompanied by a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings indicate that under serum deprivation, ginsenosides enhance apoptosis in A549 cells, likely through the regulation of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO pathway.

[PMID: 41009731] Oxidative stress (OS) is known to cause severe liver injury in weaning piglets; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed a diquat (DQ)-induced OS model in weanling piglets and performed single-cell transcriptome sequencing of liver tissue to elucidate the key molecular and cellular events involved in OS-induced hepatic damage. First, piglets were treated with 12 mg/kg DQ and the same amount of saline, and the histopathology, biochemical indicators, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of piglets were analyzed. Mouse hepatocytes were used to verify the mechanism of differentially expressed genes, including <i>STAT3</i> knockdown/overexpression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and apoptosis assay. DQ exposure caused significant oxidative damage in the liver of piglets, which was manifested as decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (<i>p</i> < 0.05), glutathione (GSH) consumption (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Cell type-specific responses were revealed by scRNA-seq, with hepatocytes showing the most pronounced transcriptomic alterations (752 genes up-regulated and 918 genes down-regulated). The expression of <i>STAT3</i> was up-regulated in hepatocytes (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and down-regulated in B cells. The functional enrichment of macrophages involved FOXO/MAPK signaling and OS pathways. In vitro experiments showed that DQ treatment (IC50 = 125.8 μmol/L) led to an increase in ROS content and apoptosis, <i>STAT3</i> silencing aggravated ROS and apoptosis (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and <i>STAT3</i> overexpression alleviated ROS and apoptosis (<i>p</i> < 0.05). STAT3 activation increases HO-1 and Bcl-2, while inhibiting Bax and shifting the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio toward cell survival. It has been shown that DQ induces OS and apoptosis in a cell type-dependent manner, in which <i>STAT3</i> plays a key regulatory role in antioxidant defense and cell survival. Targeting <i>STAT3</i> may be a therapeutic strategy for DQ-induced hepatotoxicity.

[PMID: 41007268] Ammonia is a common toxic pollutant in aquaculture environments that poses significant threats to the health, growth, and survival of aquatic organisms. This study investigates the physiological and molecular responses of triploid <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> to ammonia exposure, focusing on the activation and regulation of oxidative stress and immune-related pathways. By integrating histological observations, biochemical assays, and transcriptomic analysis, we systematically revealed the oxidative stress and immune regulatory mechanisms in the hepatopancreas of triploid <i>C. gigas</i> under ammonia exposure. Results showed significant tissue damage in the hepatopancreas, disrupted activities of key antioxidant enzymes including SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px, along with elevated MDA levels, indicating oxidative damage to cellular membrane lipids. Transcriptomic data further indicated significant activation of the glutathione metabolism pathway, with antioxidant genes such as <i>GPX5</i> and <i>GPX7</i> displaying a dynamic pattern of initial upregulation followed by downregulation, suggesting their critical roles in modulating oxidative stress responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Immunologically, ammonia exposure significantly activated lysosomal and phagosomal pathways, as well as multiple signaling cascades including FOXO, mTOR, and PI3K-Akt. Several key immune regulatory genes exhibited dynamic expression changes, reflecting coordinated regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, and energy metabolism to maintain immune defense and cellular homeostasis. Notably, dynamic expression of the <i>GADD45</i> gene family in the FOXO signaling pathway underscores the important role of triploid <i>C. gigas</i> in mounting stress responses and adaptive immune regulation under ammonia toxicity. This study provides in-depth molecular insights into the integrated response mechanisms of triploid oysters to ammonia exposure, offering a molecular foundation for understanding bivalve adaptation to ammonia and revealing novel perspectives on molluscan ammonia tolerance.

[PMID: 40917857] Ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains a major global health burden, highlighting the urgent need for early, non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, have emerged as promising candidates due to their stability in circulation and involvement in cardiovascular processes. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the potential of specific miRNAs as early diagnostic biomarkers in IHD. We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to June 31, 2024. Eligible studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. We identified recurrently dysregulated miRNAs and used miRTarBase to retrieve experimentally validated gene targets. Subsequently, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using Enrichr, referencing BioPlanet, KEGG, and Panther pathway libraries. Functional annotation was further explored using TAM 2.0. A total of 38 studies met the inclusion criteria. Among the reported miRNAs, miR-126, miR-21, miR-145, miR-92a, and miR-155 were the most frequently and consistently dysregulated across various IHD subtypes. Although expression patterns varied, these miRNAs were recurrently implicated in IHD-related processes. GSEA revealed enrichment of their gene targets in key pathways such as p53, TGF-β, and FoxO signaling, as well as in processes involving apoptosis and angiogenesis critical in vascular injury, remodeling, and immune activation. Several cancer-related pathways were also enriched, underscoring molecular overlaps between tumorigenesis and atherosclerosis. TAM 2.0 functional annotation supported these findings, linking the selected miRNAs to smooth muscle differentiation, cytokine signaling, and regulation by key transcription factors including SMAD4, STAT3, and AP-1. Our findings suggest that a panel combining the identified miRNAs may offer greater diagnostic value for IHD than individual markers, given their involvement in multiple IHD-related biological processes and pathways. The recurrent dysregulation of these miRNAs across diverse studies supports their potential as components of a robust, non-invasive diagnostic tool. However, expression variability and pathway overlap with other diseases, such as cancer, indicate the need for further validation. Larger prospective studies are warranted to validate their clinical applicability in IHD screening and risk stratification.

[PMID: 40829793] Identification of functional genes associated with milk production is essential for establishing effective breeding programs in dairy cattle. To date, the specific functional genes involved in milk production in dairy cows remain to be identified. In this study, we used public RNA-seq data from dairy cows and employed gene co-expression network analysis to identify the integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) as a potential candidate gene related to lactation. In vitro assays demonstrated that ITGB1 knockdown in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T) inhibited cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and reduced triglyceride levels. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed that ITGB1 knockdown resulted in differential expression of 503 genes, which were significantly enriched in the FoxO, IL-17, and HIF-1 signaling pathways. Moreover, ITGB1 knockdown caused a reduction in the phosphorylation of both AKT and FoxO1. Conversely, SC79-mediated activation of AKT promoted the phosphorylation and nuclear export of FoxO1, which in turn inhibited the expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as BIM and BAX, thereby attenuating the pro-apoptotic effects induced by ITGB1 knockdown in MAC-T cells. Our findings indicate that ITGB1 is a functional gene regulating milk production and a promising candidate gene for selective breeding in dairy cattle.

[PMID: 40819162] Heart failure (HF) is a common clinical syndrome caused by ventricular dysfunction and one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Previous studies have suggested that anoikis is relevant to HF. This study aimed to identify hub genes associated with anoikis that may offer therapeutic targets for HF. Gene expression data for GSE36074 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and anoikis-related genes (ARGs) were extracted from GeneCards. GEO2R was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs), then by overlapping DEGs with ARGs, differentially expressed ARGs (DEARGs) were screened. The biological functions of the DEARGs were determined using DAVID. Subsequently, two machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to identify hub DEARGs: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest (RF). In addition, miRNA-hub DEARGs and drug-hub DEARGs networks were constructed. Lastly, the hub DEARGs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Immunofluorescence (IF). A total of 138 DEARGs were identified in GSE36074. Functional analysis of DEARGs revealed that they were primarily enriched in the positive regulation of the apoptotic process, PI3K-Akt, and FoxO signaling pathways. Subsequently, two hub DEARGs (Tln1 and TGFβ2) were screened using LASSO and RF algorithms. According to the miRNA-hub DEARGs networks, Tln1 and TGFβ2 were regulated by 34 and 68 miRNAs, respectively. Moreover, drug-hub DEARGs networks showed that Gemogenovatucel-t, Lerdelimumab, Belagenpumatucel-l, Fresolimumab, Bintrafusp alfa, Trabedersen and Luspatercept-aamt are potential drugs that could target TGFβ2. Finally, RT-qPCR and IF validation of two key DEARGs (Tln1 and TGFβ2) supported our bioinformatics analysis. These findings suggest that Tln1 and TGFβ2 may play important roles in HF development through the regulation of anoikis and may serve as therapeutic targets for HF. Not applicable.",10

Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187266] In the zebrafish retina, incident light undergoes wavelength-dependent processing encompassing mechanisms such as color opponency, contrast enhancement, and motion detection prior to neural transmission to the brain proper. In darkness, photoreceptors continuously release glutamate into the synaptic cleft, a process that diminishes in response to increased light intensity, thereby conveying visual signals to ON and OFF bipolar cells. Specifically, in zebrafish, the ON pathway signal transduction is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 6b (mGluR6b) and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs). Here, we demonstrate that the knockout of <i>eaat5b</i> and <i>eaat7</i> disrupts electroretinogram responses to short and long-wavelength stimuli while preserving middle-wavelength responses, suggesting wavelength-specific roles. We found differential expression of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in the outer plexiform layer, particularly in the strike zone, crucial for prey capture, supporting task-specific involvement of these signaling pathways. In order to investigate this, we developed a virtual hunting assay using UV light stimuli. Such a behavioral assay targeting short and long wavelengths indicates that EAAT5b and EAAT7 influence UV-dependent prey detection and motion sensing differently. Our findings highlight the importance of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in modulating light integration dynamics in the zebrafish retina.

[PMID: 41187218] Given the urgent need for more specific, sensitive, and non-invasive markers for prostate cancer screening and differential diagnosis, circulating miRNAs have emerged as valuable candidates. Sixty seven prostate cancer subjects in different stages were included in this study. The participants were categorized into groups based on their pathological characteristics as local, biochemical relapse and metastatic. We retrieved eligible datasets from GEO database to identify stage-specific differentially expressed up/down-regulated genes. Cytohubba, built-in application of Cytoscape software, and Reactome pathway database were applied to select hub genes. To select upstream miRNAs, we utilized the MiRWalk and miRNet online tools. To construct the miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks, we employed rna22. Finally, three miRNAs and five target genes were validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PCa patients compared with benign prostate hyperplasia. PSA level was also measured using ELISA. Our findings revealed the potential role of PRC1 and UBA52 to be used as biomarkers for the metastatic stage, RCC1 for both biochemical relapse, and metastatic subjects. Furthermore, elevated levels of miR-124-3p and downregulation of miR-133a-3p can be introduced as biochemical relapse stage identifier. We also identified the tumor suppressor role of miR-17-5p, which was associated with higher Gleason scores. We propose PRC1, UBA52, RCC1, miR-124-3p and miR133a-3p as stage-specific PCa identifiers.

[PMID: 41187191] Severe viral and bacterial pneumonia are among the most common causes of death worldwide. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1)'s on methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)-induced severe pneumonia following cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. A young mouse model of severe pneumonia was established using Staphylococcus aureus and CMV. LTBP1 overexpression was induced, and pathological changes in lung tissue were assessed through H&E staining. Serum levels of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and interleukin (IL)-1β, were measured using ELISA. Bacterial load in the lungs was quantified, and protein expression levels of LTBP1, TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad3, and p-Smad3 in lung tissue were analyzed using Western blot. The LTBP1 expression was reduced in the young mouse model of severe pneumonia induced by Staphylococcus aureus after cytomegalovirus reactivation. Overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited lung damage, reduced serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and decreased bacterial load in the lungs. Additionally, overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. LTBP1 efficiently reduces severe pneumonia by activating the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating this condition.

[PMID: 41187184] Most COVID-19 cases are mild, but some require hospitalization due to pneumonia, with symptoms like hypoxia and dyspnea. This has led to speculation about erythrocyte involvement in the infection. This study aimed to examine the differences in the presence of dysmorphic erythrocytes in COVID-19 patients upon admission compared to healthy subjects, as well as to assess these differences in relation to the severity of the clinical presentation of COVID-19. This study included 150 participants: 100 COVID-19 patients and 50 healthy subjects who formed the control group. The COVID-19 positive participants were divided into two groups based on the deterioration or improvement of their health conditions during hospitalization. Hematological parameters were analyzed, and peripheral blood smears were prepared to observe morphological changes in erythrocytes. The morphological changes observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients included spiculated red blood cells (RBCs), spherocytes, stomatocytes, schistocytes, knizocytes, keratocytes, as well as mushroom- and cup-shaped RBCs. At admission, spiculated RBCs and spherocytes were more prevalent in patients showing improvement. Conversely, stomatocytes, knizocytes, keratocytes, and mushroom-shaped RBCs were more frequent in patients experiencing deterioration. Additionally, spiculated RBCs were more common in patients with improvement, while stomatocytes, schistocytes, knizocytes, keratocytes, mushroom-, and cup-shaped RBCs were more prevalent in deteriorating patients. The complete blood count and the examination of peripheral blood smears in hospitalized patients may serve as fundamental tools to assist clinicians in differentiating disease severity and improving treatment decision-making.

[PMID: 41187170] Germ layer specification represents a critical transition where pluripotent cells acquire lineage-specific identities. We identify the maternal transcription factors Foxi2 and Sox3 to be pivotal master regulators of ectodermal germ layer specification in Xenopus. Ectopic co-expression of Foxi2 and Sox3 in prospective endodermal tissue induces the expression of ectodermal markers while suppressing mesendodermal markers. Transcriptomics analyses reveal that Foxi2 and Sox3 jointly and independently regulate hundreds of ectodermal target genes. During early cleavage stages, Foxi2 and Sox3 pre-bind to key cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), marking sites that later recruit Ep300 and facilitate H3K27ac deposition, thereby shaping the epigenetic landscape of the ectodermal genome. These CRMs are highly enriched within ectoderm-specific super-enhancers (SEs). Our findings highlight the pivotal role of ectodermal SE-associated CRMs in precise and robust ectodermal gene activation, establishing Foxi2 and Sox3 as central architects of ectodermal lineage specification.

[PMID: 41187093] Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) brings an important contribution in diagnosing pulmonary diseases. The analysis of standard cell distribution and the assessment of iron-laden macrophages (the Golde score) are integral to standard medical reports. However, the traditional cytological method of manual cell counting is subject to interobserver variability and staining quality issues. To address these issues, we trained AI-based algorithms to enhance the accuracy of differentiated cell counts of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, ciliated cells and squamous cells as well as the Golde score, which assesses the hemosiderin content in macrophages. For this purpose, we assembled an internal sample cohort with 16 Hemacolor, 16 Papanicolaou and 5 iron-stained smears. For validation, we used 10 slides each of Papanicolaou and Hemacolor staining and 5 with iron staining. The algorithm achieved fair to excellent correlation compared to two cytologists: For Papanicolaou staining, the correlations were: Macrophages 0.96, lymphocytes 0.98, neutrophil granulocytes 0.99, eosinophils 0.58, ciliated cells 0.61, squamous cells 0.31. In Hemacolor staining: macrophages 0.97, lymphocytes 0.92, neutrophils 0.99, eosinophils 0.99, cylindrical cells 0.58, squamous cells -0.145. The automated Golde score calculation deviated on average by 19 points from the manual evaluation. The study demonstrates the potential of AI-supported methods for BAL analysis in diagnostic cytology. The high accuracy in recognizing cell types and calculating the Golde score underlines the benefits of expanding the training data for broader clinical applications. Further research is encouraged to support the use of digital cytology on conventional smears in clinical practice.

[PMID: 41187081] The fetomaternal interface is replete with glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) that can interact with cell surface glycoprotein counterreceptors to regulate placental function. Here, we interrogate the role of galectin-3, a GBP that controls placental trophoblast syncytialization, an important differentiation process where progenitor cytotrophoblast cells fuse to produce the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast. The molecular mechanism of galectin-3-mediated fusion has not yet been elucidated in part due to the difficulty of studying glycan-GBP binding events in live cells. To overcome these challenges, we employ a proximity labeling strategy to identify the galectin-3 interactome. From this interactome dataset, we selected and validated CD9 and integrin beta 1 as functional counterreceptors of galectin-3 and showed that CD9 is glycosylated with an N-linked glycan at a rare noncanonical sequon. Furthermore, we present evidence that galectin-3 acts to physically alter the fluidity of the cellular membrane, and it does not activate canonical syncytialization signaling pathways. Overall, we report that galectin-mediated binding events and their corresponding functions in cell biology can be precisely regulated by select glycoproteins at specific glycosites.

[PMID: 41186886] Procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1) is important for extracellular matrix formation and is involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer; however, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mechanistic importance of PLOD1 as a regulator of GC. We examined the potential function and prognostic efficiency of PLOD1 in GC using a variety of bioinformatics methods. In vitro, we assessed the ability of PLOD1 to regulate GC by CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, and Elisa assay analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of PLOD1 on the immune escape of GC cells by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Elisa assay. Analysis of PLOD1 expression in gastric cancer and other cancers in public databases as well as survival showed that low expression of PLOD1 has better survival, while the AUC area under the ROC curve of this gene showed that this gene has better prognostic value. Meanwhile, the results of correlation analysis between PLOD1 and 60 immune checkpoints showed that the gene was positively correlated with immune checkpoint genes, and one of the genes with the largest correlation was CD276, and the pearson's correlation between PLOD1 and cancer immune cycle was also calculated, and the relationship between PLOD1 and the immune microenvironment was evaluated, and the enrichment of the immune infiltration analysis into a larger number of immune cells among which the importance of PLOD1 was determined. Differential gene analysis was then performed on the gastric cancer dataset, using the differential genes to perform WGCNA network co-expression analysis with the PLOD1 gene, and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed on these differential genes, enriching for cancer-related pathways and cell cycle signaling pathways. Two key genes were then obtained in the analysis with glycolysis, while drug sensitivity analysis was performed, yielding multiple potential drugs such as AZD7545, BRD-K03911514 and BRD-K14844214. Furthermore, in vitro experiments further demonstrated that PLOD1 increased the proliferation and migration ability of GC cells by promoting immune escape. The results of this study suggest that PLOD1 is an important regulator of GC progression and participates in the immune escape process of GC, which is expected to be a potential target for GC treatment.",10

GD2 is a suitable target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy due to its overexpression in several solid tumors. In this preclinical study, we investigated the potential use of iCasp9.2A.GD2.CAR-CD28.4-1BBζ (CAR.GD2) T-cells as a treatment option for patients who have GD2-positive sarcomas and we sought to identify factors shaping hostile tumor microenvironment in this setting. GD2 expression was evaluated by flow-cytometry on primary tumor biopsies of pediatric sarcoma patients. GD2 expression in sarcoma cells was also evaluated in response to an enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitor (Tazemetostat). The antitumor activity of CAR.GD2 T-cells was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of orthotopic and/or metastatic soft-tissue and bone sarcomas. GD2 expression was detected in 55% of the primary tumors. Notably, the Osteosarcoma and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcomas subtypes exhibited the highest GD2 expression levels, while Ewing sarcoma showed the lowest. CAR.GD2 T-cells show a significant tumor control both in vitro and in vivo models of GD2-expressing tumors. Pretreatment with an EZH2 inhibitor (Tazemetostat) upregulating GD2 expression, sensitizes GD2<sup>dim</sup> sarcoma cells to CAR.GD2 T-cells cytotoxic activity. Moreover, in mouse models of disseminated Rhabdomyosarcomas and orthotopic Osteosarcoma, CAR.GD2 T-cells showed both a vigorous anti-tumor activity and long-term persistence as compared to un-transduced T-cells. The presence of immunosuppressive murine myeloid-derived suppressor (MDSC) cells significantly reduces long-term anti-tumour activity of infused CAR.GD2 T-cells. Tumor-derived G-CSF was found to be one of the key factors driving expansion of immunosuppressive murine and human MDSC, thus indirectly limiting the efficacy of CAR.GD2 T-cells. Our preclinical data strongly suggest that CAR.GD2 T-cells hold promise as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with GD2-positive sarcomas. Strategies to tackle hostile immunosuppressive MDSC are desirable to optimize CAR.GD2 T-cell activity.

[PMID: 39695096] The role of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in regulating the antitumor immune response in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) remains poorly understood. Here we transcriptionally and phenotypically profiled non-malignant (CD19<sup>-</sup> CD138<sup>-</sup>) BM cells from WM patients with a focus on myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) to provide a deeper understanding of their role in WM. We found that HLA-DR<sup>low</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs were significantly increased in WM patients as compared to normal controls, with an expansion of predominantly polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs. Single-cell immunogenomic profiling of WM MDSCs identified an immune-suppressive gene signature with upregulated inflammatory pathways associated with interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling. Gene signatures associated with an inflammatory and immune suppressive environment were predominately expressed in PMN-MDSCs. In vitro, WM PMN-MDSCs demonstrated robust T-cell suppression and their viability and expansion was notably enhanced by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and TNFα. Furthermore, BM malignant B-cells attracted PMN-MDSCs to a greater degree than monocytic MDSCs. Collectively, these data suggest that malignant WM B cells actively recruit PMN-MDSCs which promote an immunosuppressive BM microenvironment through a direct T cell inhibition, while release of G-CSF/TNFα in the microenvironment further promotes PMN-MDSC expansion and in turn immune suppression. Targeting PMN-MDSCs may therefore represent a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with WM.

[PMID: 35089465] In cancer, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are known to escape the host immune system by developing a highly suppressive environment. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism behind MDSC-mediated tumor cell evasion of the immune system. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling elicited in the tumor microenvironment has the potential to induce MDSC differentiations in different organs. Therefore, MDSC elimination by blocking the action of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), which is a key adaptor-signaling molecule that affects TLR activity, seems to be an ideal tumor immunotherapy. Previous studies have proven that blocking MyD88 signaling with a novel MyD88 inhibitor (TJ-M2010-5, synthesized by Zhou's group) completely prevented colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) development in mice. In the present study, we investigated the impact of the novel MyD88 inhibitor on the number, phenotype, and function of MDSC in the mice model of CAC. We showed that CAC growth inhibition was involved in diminished MDSC generation, expansion, and suppressive function and that MDSC-mediated immune escape was dependent on MyD88 signaling pathway activation. MyD88 inhibitor treatment decreased the accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in mice with CAC, thereby reducing cytokine (GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6 and TGF-β) secretion associated with MDSC accumulation, and reducing the expression of molecules (iNOS, Arg-1 and IDO) associated with the suppressive capacity of MDSCs. In addition, MyD88 inhibitor treatment reduced the differentiation of MDSCs from myeloid cells and the suppressive capacity of MDSCs on the proliferation of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro. MDSCs are primary cellular targets of a novel MyD88 inhibitor during CAC development. Our findings prove that MyD88 signaling is involved in the regulation of the immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs. The novel MyD88 inhibitor TJ-M2010-5 is a new and effective agent that modulates MyD88 signaling to overcome MDSC suppressive functions, enabling the development of successful antitumor immunotherapy.

[PMID: 34675917] Reactive oxygen species, including RNS, contribute to the control of multiple immune cell functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) represent the archetype of tolerogenic cells that actively contribute to dismantle effective immunity against cancer. TIMs inhibit T cell functions and promote tumor progression by several mechanisms including the amplification of the oxidative/nitrosative stress within the TME. In tumors, TIM expansion and differentiation is regulated by the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is produced by cancer and immune cells. Nevertheless, the role of GM-CSF in tumors has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we show that GM-CSF activity is significantly affected by RNS-triggered post-translational modifications. The nitration of a single tryptophan residue in the sequence of GM-CSF nourishes the expansion of highly immunosuppressive myeloid subsets in tumor-bearing hosts. Importantly, tumors from colorectal cancer patients express higher levels of nitrated tryptophan compared to non-neoplastic tissues. Collectively, our data identify a novel and selective target that can be exploited to remodel the TME and foster protective immunity against cancer.

[PMID: 34580061] Tumor-initiating cells (TIC) are associated with tumor initiation, growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) is a TIC marker in many cancers, including breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ALDH1A1 functions in solid tumors remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that ALDH1A1 enzymatic activity facilitates breast tumor growth. Mechanistically, ALDH1A1 decreased the intracellular pH in breast cancer cells to promote phosphorylation of TAK1, activate NFκB signaling, and increase the secretion of GM-CSF, which led to myeloid-derived suppressor cell expansion and immunosuppression. Furthermore, the ALDH1A1 inhibitor disulfiram and chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine cooperatively inhibited breast tumor growth and tumorigenesis by purging ALDH<sup>+</sup> TICs and activating T-cell immunity. These findings elucidate how active ALDH1A1 modulates the immune system to promote tumor development, highlighting new therapeutic strategies for malignant breast cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: ALDH1A1 enzyme activity induces MDSC expansion and triggers a procancer immune microenvironment to facilitate breast cancer progression, providing a novel therapeutic vulnerability in this disease.

[PMID: 30816302] Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a major adaptor protein in antiviral innate immune signaling, is considered as one of the most important regulators of antiviral and antitumor immunity. Although STING agonists are now intensively studied in clinical trials as a new class of adjuvants to boost cancer immunotherapy, the tumor-intrinsic role of the STING pathway in shaping the tumor microenvironment remains controversial. Here, we discovered that STING plays a vital role in regulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) differentiation and antitumor immunity in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Mechanistic analyses reveal that STING represses NPC-derived MDSC induction by enhancing SOCS1 expression in both tumor cells and MDSCs. SOCS1 physically interacts with STAT3 through its SH2 domain to prevent STAT3 phosphorylation and dimerization, resulting in reduced MDSC induction via inhibition of GM-CSF and IL-6 production. Notably, reduced tumoral STING expression was found to be significantly associated with a poor prognosis for NPC patients. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism linking STING to tumor microenvironmental cytokine production and MDSC induction.

[PMID: 30733283] Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly immune-suppressive tumor with a low response rate to single checkpoint blockade therapy. ETS homologous factor (EHF) is a tumor suppressor in PDAC. Here, we report a novel function of EHF in pancreatic cancer immune microenvironment editing and efficacy prediction for anti-PD1 therapy. Our findings support that the deficiency of tumoral EHF induced the accumulation of regulatory T (T reg) cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and a decrease in the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Mechanistically, EHF deficiency induced the conversion and expansion of T reg cells and MDSCs through inhibiting tumor TGFβ1 and GM-CSF secretion. EHF suppressed the transcription of <i>TGFB1</i> and <i>CSF2</i> by directly binding to their promoters. Mice bearing EHF overexpression tumors exhibited significantly better response to anti-PD1 therapy than those with control tumors. Our findings delineate the immunosuppressive mechanism of EHF deficiency in PDAC and highlight that EHF overexpression may improve PDAC checkpoint immunotherapy.

[PMID: 30318088] Unlike other regulatory circuits, cancer-induced myeloid dysfunction involves more than an accumulation of impaired dendritic cells, protumoral macrophages, and myeloid derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment. It is also characterized by ""aberrant"" myelopoiesis that results in the accumulation and expansion of immature myeloid precursors with a suppressive phenotype in the systemic circulation. The first part of this review briefly describes the evidence for and consequences of this systemic dysfunctional myelopoiesis and the possible reinforcement of this phenomenon by conventional treatments used in patients with cancer, in particular chemotherapy and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. The second half of this review describes very small size particles, a novel immune-modulatory nanoparticle, and the evidence indicating a possible role of this agent in correcting or re-programming the dysfunctional myelopoiesis in different scenarios.

[PMID: 29770434] The expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) correlates with tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we found a significant association between CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSC number and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) levels in CRC patients (P < 0·05). Moreover, the CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs, YAP1 and PTEN were identified as predictors for the prognosis of CRC patients (P < 0·05). Notably, CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs were an independent survival predictor for CRC patients through a Cox model analysis. In vitro data determined that the expression levels of YAP1 and PTEN in CRC-derived cell lines were associated with CRC-derived MDSC induction, and the blockade of YAP1 and PTEN decreased CRC-derived MDSC induction. A mechanistic analysis revealed that YAP1 promoted CRC-derived MDSC induction by suppressing PTEN expression to up-regulate COX-2, P-AKT and P-p65 in CRC-derived cells, leading to secretion of the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Our findings establish a novel mechanism of pro-tumorigenic MDSC induction mediated by ectopic YAP1 and PTEN expression in CRC.

[PMID: 29600976] To evaluate the role of endostatin (ES) gene therapy on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in a metastatic model of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Balb/C mice bearing orthotopic Renca tumors were treated with NIH/3T3-LendSN or, as a control, with NIH/3T3-LXSN cells. At the end of in vivo experiment, plasma and tissue lung samples were collected. Plasma ES and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels were measured by ELISA and Milliplex, respectively. Quantification of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells and their subsets was performed by flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSC using the DCFDA marker by flow cytometry. Metastatic RCC (mRCC) induced expansions of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSC and promoted accumulation of these cells and their subtypes in lymphoid organ and metastases. ES treatment promoted low G-CSF plasmatic levels which were produced by the tumor microenvironment, reflecting the reduced metastatic accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSC in the lungs. However, the therapy was selective for granulocytic cells, thus reducing the production of ROS. These findings confirm the expansion of MDSC during metastatic progression of RCC and indicate the important role of ES in reducing MDSC and possible use of ES therapy in combined anticancer treatment.",10

[PMID: 41187066] Mice often serve as valuable surrogate models for studying human reproduction. This study provides a single-cell transcriptomic profile of mouse immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout pregnancy and assesses the similarities and differences between these immune cells and human decidual immune cells. Homeostasis of the immune microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface is essential for pregnancy. Immune cell heterogeneity at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnant mice remains understudied. Here, we perform in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analysis with 120,238 maternal-fetal single cells of mice from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E18.5 and in vitro experiments to establish an immune cell atlas. Macrophages constitute the largest population, with some subsets resembling human counterparts, and the number of Ccr2 + macrophages in the decidua increases as pregnancy progresses. Neutrophils constitute the second largest population, and Ifit1 + N2 neutrophils are localized close to the implantation site during early pregnancy. Three NK cell subsets were identified, including the previously reported NK1.1 - subset. In combination with in vitro experiments, the presence of T and B cells within the decidua was validated. Our work profiles a comprehensive immune cell atlas of the mouse maternal-fetal interface, offering a valuable reference for further investigations.

[PMID: 41186991] Predictive biomarkers to guide chemotherapy decisions for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are lacking. Preclinical studies indicate that circulating tumor cell (CTC) studies of chromosomal instability (CTC-CIN) can predict taxane resistance. The CARD trial randomized subjects with mCRPC progressing within a year of treatment with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI; enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone/prednisone) to cabazitaxel or the alternative ARPI. As a pre-planned biomarker analysis, CTCs were isolated from blood samples obtained at baseline; cycle two, and end of treatment. Associations between baseline CTC and CTC-CIN counts with imaging-based progression free survival (ibPFS), overall survival (OS), time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, RECIST 1.1 objective response rate (ORR), and PSA50 response rate (PRR) were assessed. High baseline CTC-CIN counts significantly associated with worse OS after adjustment for confounding variables (median OS, 15.3 vs 8.9 months; univariate HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.52 - 3.06; p < 0.001; multivariate HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.01 - 2.43; p = 0.047). Detectable CTC-CIN counts at baseline may predict a lack of ibPFS and OS benefit when comparing cabazitaxel to ARPI. This preplanned biomarker analysis of CARD confirms that CTC-CIN counts are a clinically useful prognostic and predictive biomarker of taxane resistance in mCRPC. Detectable CTC-CIN at baseline defines a patient subpopulation with unmet clinical needs in which alternative therapeutics should be tested. CARD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02485691.

[PMID: 41186900] Achieving high-quality immune reconstitution (IR) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is directly associated with the patient's ability to resist infections, prevent tumor relapses, and suppress graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The status of CD4 + T cells is critical for reconstituting adaptive immunity after transplantation; however, the patterns of reconstitution and their influencing factors remain unclear. This retrospective cohort study involved 164 patients who underwent myeloablative allo-HSCT from April 2016 to May 2023. Based on the early post-transplantation CD4 + T cell counts, the cohort was divided into two groups: 73 patients with high-quality IR (HIR) and 34 patients with low-quality IR (LIR). LIR was associated with an increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation following transplantation. Plasma EBV viral load was monitored weekly using quantitative PCR for the first 100 days post-transplantation. The LIR group had a higher viral load at the time of the first EBV reactivation and a significantly earlier first reactivation compared to the HIR group. No significant differences were observed in overall survival, GVHD incidence, or relapse rates between the groups. A CD4 + T cell count of < 60 cells/μL within 30 days post-transplantation was associated with a higher incidence of EBV viremia compared to the control group. These findings suggest that early CD4 + T cell counts may serve as a predictive marker for post-transplant EBV infection.

[PMID: 41186886] Procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1) is important for extracellular matrix formation and is involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer; however, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mechanistic importance of PLOD1 as a regulator of GC. We examined the potential function and prognostic efficiency of PLOD1 in GC using a variety of bioinformatics methods. In vitro, we assessed the ability of PLOD1 to regulate GC by CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, and Elisa assay analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of PLOD1 on the immune escape of GC cells by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Elisa assay. Analysis of PLOD1 expression in gastric cancer and other cancers in public databases as well as survival showed that low expression of PLOD1 has better survival, while the AUC area under the ROC curve of this gene showed that this gene has better prognostic value. Meanwhile, the results of correlation analysis between PLOD1 and 60 immune checkpoints showed that the gene was positively correlated with immune checkpoint genes, and one of the genes with the largest correlation was CD276, and the pearson's correlation between PLOD1 and cancer immune cycle was also calculated, and the relationship between PLOD1 and the immune microenvironment was evaluated, and the enrichment of the immune infiltration analysis into a larger number of immune cells among which the importance of PLOD1 was determined. Differential gene analysis was then performed on the gastric cancer dataset, using the differential genes to perform WGCNA network co-expression analysis with the PLOD1 gene, and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed on these differential genes, enriching for cancer-related pathways and cell cycle signaling pathways. Two key genes were then obtained in the analysis with glycolysis, while drug sensitivity analysis was performed, yielding multiple potential drugs such as AZD7545, BRD-K03911514 and BRD-K14844214. Furthermore, in vitro experiments further demonstrated that PLOD1 increased the proliferation and migration ability of GC cells by promoting immune escape. The results of this study suggest that PLOD1 is an important regulator of GC progression and participates in the immune escape process of GC, which is expected to be a potential target for GC treatment.

[PMID: 41186841] This study aims to screen for differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and lncRNAs (DELncRNAs) related to autophagy in bone nonunion through transcriptome sequencing, and explore their molecular mechanisms at the cellular level. In this study, 5 pairs of bone nonunion and bone healing tissue samples were collected for RNA sequencing to obtain DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of autophagy-related differential genes was constructed. In addition, an lncRNAs-mRNAs interaction network was constructed. qRT-PCR was used to verify key autophagy-related genes. shBNIP3 was transfected into Wistar rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and 14 days after osteoinduction, cell migration and osteoblast differentiation were detected by transwell, alizarin red staining, and ALP staining. A total of 1108 DEmRNAs and 46 DElncRNAs were identified, and further screening resulted in 15 autophagy-related DEmRNAs. GO and KEGG analysis showed that autophagy-related DEmRNAs are mainly involved in autophagy-related pathways. In addition, the lncRNAs network included 356 relationship pairs, and 5 central autophagy-related mRNAs (BNIP3, DDIT3, SIRT2, PINK1, and BAG3) were identified. QRT-PCR verified that the expressions of BNIP3, SIRT2, PINK1, and BAG3 were up-regulated, while DDIT3 was down-regulated in patients with bone nonunion compared with patients with normal bone union. Besides, sh2BNIP3 inhibited BMSCs cell migration and osteogenic differentiation compared with Mock and BNIP3-NC groups in vitro. In this study, central autophagy-related DEmRNA may play an important role in bone nonunion, especially BNIP3, which will help us to further understand the pathogenesis of bone nonunion.

[PMID: 41186833] 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) scans have largely replaced bone marrow biopsy in the staging workup for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here, we highlight a pitfall of FDG PET/CT for assessing bone marrow involvement, detailing the clinical course of a patient diagnosed with otherwise limited-stage DLBCL who exhibited diffuse bone marrow FDG uptake, felt to be compatible with extensive lymphomatous infiltration. In accordance with current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, this finding circumvented the need for a formal staging bone marrow biopsy procedure. Subsequent clinical developments revealed extensive bone marrow involvement by a second, unexpected malignancy (multiple myeloma), casting doubt on the assumption that the initial diffuse marrow uptake was attributable to DLBCL. The presented case emphasizes the challenges of interpreting diffuse FDG uptake within the bone marrow compartment and highlights the inherent contribution of histomorphology for the accurate diagnosis and classification of hematolymphoid neoplasms.

[PMID: 41186775] Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation, and pulmonary edema. Asthma may be triggered by allergens, certain medications, environmental exposure, respiratory infection, and physical exertion. Patients with asthma express higher levels of T helper cell 2 (Th2) cytokines i.e., IL-4 and IL-5. Estragole (EST), a phytochemical in essential oils, has shown anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Current study was set out with the objectives to evaluate the anti-asthmatic effects of EST using various in vivo and in vitro experiments. Thirty-six (36) albino BALB/c mice were divided into six groups: Normal group (NG), OVA-induced asthma group (DG), Methylprednisolone group (MPG group, 15 mg/kg), Low, medium and high doses of EST (LDE: 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg, respectively). Mice were sensitized with 20 µg of OVA intraperitoneally and treated with EST during the challenge phase (21-27 days). Lung wet/dry ratio, total and differential leukocyte counts (TLC and DLC) in blood and Bronchoalveolar Lavage fluid (BALF) collections, histopathology (H&E, PAS), mRNA expressions of IL-4 and IL-5 in the lungs were analyzed, and molecular docking was performed. Airway inflammation was found ameliorated in EST treated groups as evident by reduction in TLC and DLC in both blood and BALF samples, and attenuation of infiltration of inflammatory cells in lungs. Furthermore, EST significantly reduced IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression levels in the lungs tissue and demonstrated notable binding affinity with IL-4 (- 4.5 kcal/mol), IL-5 (- 4.7 kcal/mol), and GATA-3 (- 5.3 kcal/mol). These docking results support the in vivo findings by suggesting a possible interaction of EST with key Th2 mediators, and their transcriptional regulator to suppress downstream airway inflammation, consistent with its observed anti-asthmatic effects. Estragole possesses anti-asthmatic property by attenuation of airway inflammation and pulmonary edema. Molecular docking, RT-qPCR, and histopathological evaluations suggesting that EST may attenuate allergic asthma via attenuation in Th2-mediated markers i.e., IL-4, IL-5, and GATA-3.

[PMID: 41186719] Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase and core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is an important player in cancer progression through its powerful effects on chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. In addition to its classical role in regulating the cell cycle and tumor proliferation, numerous publications have identified the broad role of EZH2 in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), leading to immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. EZH2 has been shown to silence immune surveillance genes by binding to H3K27me3 histone, leading to epigenetic silencing in lymphomas and thereby reducing tumor immunogenicity, which facilitates immune escape. EZH2 also modulates the recruitment and activity of immunosuppressive cells by epigenetically modifying cytokine and chemokine networks. Importantly, EZH2 upregulates PD-L1 expression either directly or indirectly through its pro-oncogenic activation of STAT3 signaling, which induces T cell exhaustion and ultimately resistance to checkpoint inhibitors in cancers such as breast cancer and glioblastoma. Furthermore, EZH2 also influences the regulation of immune-related microRNAs, including the suppression of the miR-144/451a cluster, which encourages immunosuppressive macrophage polarization. Pharmacological EZH2 inhibition has been shown to be an arm of a synergistic therapy, combining immune checkpoint blockade therapies, which can reinstate antigen presentation and T cell infiltration, highlighting EZH2 as an essential epigenetic modulator of tumor-immune interactions. It remains a viable target for therapy to overcome immune resistance and improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes.",10

Despite evidence it may also be expressed in multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), any role for GATA-3 in these cells has remained unclear. Here we found GATA-3 was in the cytoplasm in quiescent long-term stem cells from steady-state bone marrow but relocated to the nucleus when HSCs cycled. Relocation depended on signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and was associated with a diminished capacity for long-term reconstitution after transfer into irradiated mice. Deletion of Gata3 enhanced the repopulating capacity and augmented the self-renewal of long-term HSCs in cell-autonomous fashion without affecting the cell cycle. Our observations position GATA-3 as a regulator of the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in HSCs that acts downstream of the p38 signaling pathway.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187327] Neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized as pain arising from lesions of the somatosensory nervous system. However, NP-like features have been found in several chronic secondary musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions in the absence of detectable lesion or damage to the somatosensory pathways. Emerging evidence has demonstrated associations between NP-like symptoms and altered neural activity within brain regions implicated in sensory perception and affective-emotional processing of pain with consistent findings of abnormal activity in the right insula (RIns) cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG-NF) is a brain-computer interface biofeedback technique that allows individuals to self-regulate the real-time cortical brain activities of the regions of interest. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of a novel EEG-NF intervention designed to simultaneously downtrain activity in the RIns and dACC in individuals with a chronic secondary MSK pain condition exhibiting NP-like features. In addition, this study will conduct secondary exploratory analyses to investigate EEG-derived neuronal changes and their associations with clinical and experimental pain outcomes following the EEG-NF training. We will design a single-arm, open-label, pilot-feasibility trial. We will recruit adults aged 35-75 years with a score of ≥19 using the PainDETECT questionnaire and an average pain score of ≥4 on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the last 3 months, with a minimum pain duration of 3 months, to receive active EEG-NF training. Participants will receive auditory feedback as a reward for achieving a predetermined activity threshold of the RIns and dACC. Primary outcomes will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and safety using both self-reported questionnaires and monitoring data. Collected data will be summarized descriptively, with mean (SD) reported where appropriate. Secondary outcomes will include EEG parameters, self-reported measures, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing. An exploratory within-group pre-post statistical comparison will be conducted for all secondary outcome measures, and correlation analysis will be performed to explore relationships between EEG measures, self-reported outcomes, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing measures. This study has received approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Participant recruitment began in April 2025 and is ongoing. As of October 2025, data collection has been completed, with a total of 5 participants enrolled, all of whom have completed the study to date. We expect to complete the study in March 2026. This study will generate data on feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary data to inform a fully powered effectiveness clinical trial. The results and data generated will inform the design and sample size calculation for a fully powered randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of EEG-NF in targeting NP-like features in individuals with chronic MSK pain.

[PMID: 41187320] Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are thousands of toxic synthetic chemicals that bioaccumulate and persist in the environment. They are known to cause immunotoxicity, organ damage, endocrine disruption, and reproductive impairments in wildlife such as sea otters (Enhydra lutris). However, there is limited information on the distribution of these chemicals across the northeastern Pacific, and baseline data are missing to assess their potential impacts on sea otters in regions such as British Columbia (BC), Canada. We analyzed liver (n = 11) and skeletal muscle samples (n = 5) from 11 deceased sea otters from coastal BC using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency method 1633 with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. We found 8 of the 40 tested PFAS were present in all sampled sea otters, although concentrations of each PFAS varied between individuals. Sea otter livers contained more PFAS compounds at higher total average concentrations than skeletal muscle (i.e., 8 PFAS totaling 10.38 ng/g wet wt vs. 1 PFAS totaling 0.38 ng/g wet wt). Only perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) was identified in both liver and muscle tissues, whereas the remaining 7 PFAS were unique to the liver. The three PFAS that dominated the liver PFAS composition (perfluorononanoic acid, PFOSA, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) accounted for 84% of the contaminant load in the livers. Geographically, PFAS concentrations were more than three times higher on average in sea otters recovered near major cities and shipping routes. Identifying the contaminants accumulating in sea otters provides insights into the health threats confronted by recovering sea otter populations. Our study also establishes baseline PFAS contamination levels in BC sea otters, which can be used to monitor and regulate the presence of PFAS on marine environments in western Canada.

[PMID: 41187287] A growing body of evidence has identified that people's physical health could influence self-rated health and quality of life (QoL). However, only focusing on physical health is not adequate for the well-being of older adults. Studies focusing on the impact of psychological well-being on self-rated health and QoL are still rare. This study aimed to identify the mediating effect of depression on the association between psychological well-being and self-rated health and QoL to comprehensively understand the relationship between them. We used a cross-sectional study design and secondary data analysis from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey of 2017 to 2018. Path analysis was applied to examine the research questions. A large sample of 8839 older adults was included. Among them, more positive affect was found among those who were younger and had more years of schooling, higher household income, greater social security and social insurance, lower depression levels, and higher self-rated health levels. Depression had a partial mediation effect of psychological well-being on self-rated health and QoL, which explained 36% of the total variance (R2=0.36). In addition, psychological well-being had a statistically significant direct effect on self-rated health and QoL (β=0.290; P<.001). Our results indicate that psychological well-being had both direct and indirect effects on self-rated health and QoL. Depression was an important mediator that regulated the effect pathway in older adults.

[PMID: 41187286] Deep-blue perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on reduced-dimensional perovskites (RDPs) have suffered from unbalanced charge injections and uncontrolled crystallization kinetics processes, impeding the realization of high-performance PeLEDs. In this work, an interfacial chemical molecular bridge was implemented between the RDP and poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) hole transporting layer to engineer the interfacial electrical environment. The results reveal that the bridging molecule exhibits a strong interface reaction with PVK, facilitating hole injection and improving energy level alignment. Simultaneously, the molecular bridge regulates RDP crystallization dynamics, which inhibits the formation of halide clusters as well as small-<i>n</i> phases and improves defect renovation at the buried interface. As a result, the optimized RDP films exhibit a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 71.69% at 447 nm. The modified PeLEDs deliver an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.48%, along with spectrally stable deep-blue electroluminescence.

[PMID: 41187282] Opioid overdose is a global public health emergency, with the United States experiencing high rates of morbidity and mortality due to prescription and illicit opioid use. Traditional public health monitoring systems often fail to provide real-time insights, limiting their capacity for early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, especially Reddit, offer a promising alternative for timely toxicovigilance due to the abundance of user-generated, real-time content. This study aimed to explore the use of Reddit as a real-time, high-volume source for toxicovigilance and develop an automated system that can classify and analyze opioid-related social media posts to detect behavioral patterns and monitor the evolution of public discourse on opioid use. To investigate evolving social media discourse around opioid use, we collected a large-scale dataset from Reddit spanning 6 years, from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2023. Using a comprehensive opioid lexicon-including formal drug names, street slang, common misspellings, and abbreviations-we filtered relevant posts for further analysis. A subset of these data was manually annotated according to well-defined annotation guidelines into 4 categories: self-misuse, external misuse, information, and unrelated, with distributions of 37.21%, 27.25%, 27.57%, and 7.97%, respectively. To automate the classification of opioid-related chatter, we developed a robust natural language processing pipeline leveraging classical machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and transformer-based architecture, and fine-tuned a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM; OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo). In the final stage, the trained LLM was deployed on an unlabeled dataset comprising 74,975 additional Reddit chatter posts. This enabled a detailed temporal analysis of opioid-related discussions, aligned with 6 years of opioid-related death records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For this study, self-misuse and external misuse were merged into a misuse category for direct comparison with the CDC's mortality data, examining whether trends in social media discourse on opioid misuse reflect patterns in real-world mortality statistics. The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 0.93, outperforming the baseline (random forest 0.85) by representing a performance improvement of 9.14% over the machine learning model. The temporal analysis of the unlabeled data revealed evolving trends in opioid-related discussions, indicating shifts in user behavior and overdose-related chatter over time. To quantify this relationship, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between misuse-related posts and CDC death records (r=0.854). This correlation was statistically significant (P<.001), indicating a strong positive relationship between web-based discussions and CDC mortality data. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating advanced natural language processing techniques and LLMs with social media data to support real-time public health surveillance. Reddit provides a valuable platform for identifying emerging trends in opioid use and overdose risk. The proposed system offers a proactive tool for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to better understand and respond to the opioid crisis.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.",10

In clinical practice AI consists of overlapping technologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and generative AI. ML is a computer learning system that can provide insight into disease risk factors and phenotypes. Deep learning is an advanced and complex form of ML, structured with different levels of specific algorithms known as convolutional neural networks that can rapidly and accurately process unstructured, high-dimensional data, such as texts, images, and waveforms. Natural language processing is dedicated to facilitating interactions between computers and humans using natural language and helps to analyze, understand, and derive actionable information from unstructured healthcare data, including electronic health records, clinical notes, medical literature, and patient-generated content. Computer vision focuses on enabling computers to see and interpret images and videos and serves as an augmentation tool for endoscopists, improving accuracy and decreasing procedural time. Generative AI is capable of creating new forms of content by learning from a large body of data in the form of text, audio, images, or video and includes large language models. AI has been used in several GI diseases such as esophageal neoplasia, gastric cancer, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection, gastritis, GI stromal tumors, colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, GI bleeding, and pancreatobiliary diseases. The potential applications of AI in liver diseases encompass a variety of conditions such as liver masses, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver transplantation. This review discussed the common terminologies and the current status of AI in gastroenterology and hepatology, exploring its applications and ethical issues.

[PMID: 41174585] To develop and validate a prognostic model incorporating microRNA-1246 (miR-1246), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), α1-antitrypsin (A1AT), and inflammatory markers for predicting outcomes in early gastric cardia cancer after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). We retrospectively enrolled 280 patients with early gastric cardia cancer who underwent ESD between January 2021 and December 2023. Patients were divided into a training set (n = 196) and a validation set (n = 84) at a ratio of 7:3. Influencing factors were screened using univariate, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and multivariate logistic regression analyses in the training set. A nomogram was constructed, and the predictive performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical value. The incidence of poor prognosis was comparable between training (43.88%) and validation set (34.52%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified miR-1246, HMGB-1, A1AT, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and Helicobacter pylori infection as independent risk factors for poor prognosis (All P < 0.05). The nomogram demonstrated acceptable discriminative ability, with AUC of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.701-0.877) in the training set and 0.735 (95% CI: 0.638-0.835) in the validation set. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.625 and 0.841 for the training set, and 0.481 and 0.786 for the validation set, respectively. Calibration curves indicated good agreement between predicted and observed probabilities. The proposed prognostic model offers a practical tool for individualized risk assessment post-ESD. However, the clinical application warrants further validation in large-scale, multi-center prospective studies with long-term follow-up.

[PMID: 41172430] The late diagnosis of gastric cancer, which is usually diagnosed via upper digestive endoscopy, may be attributed to the failure to detect precursor lesions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of gastric cancer and its precursor lesions in individuals undergoing routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopies at a tertiary hospital in Brazil. Patients aged >40 years who had undergone diagnostic endoscopic examinations in 2017 at our institution were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. We exclude patients with more than one examination in the time-period, without gastric biopsies, and those with autoimmune atrophic gastritis and history of gastric surgery. The histopathological findings were reviewed by two gastrointestinal pathologists. The Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) classification was used in cases wherein gastric mapping was performed. Descriptive statistical analysis for the diagnostic findings of the malignant precursor lesions and gastric cancer was performed using Chi-square test. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Among the 1,071 patients (64.6% females; age 60±10.4 years old) who underwent endoscopic examinations, 277 (25.9%) were diagnosed with malignant precursor lesions or cancer, three (0.3%) dysplastic lesions, and 12 (1.1%) neoplasms. A total of 888 patients underwent gastric mapping; OLGA III and IV stages were observed in 46 (5.2%) patients. Chi-square test revealed significant correlations between dysplastic and neoplastic lesions and male sex, age >80 years and the prevalence of chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, and age 40-49 years and the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Precursor lesions for gastric cancer were observed in up to 25% of the patients, with a predominance of low-risk lesions. Further prospective studies must be conducted to evaluate the risk of gastric cancer in individuals with precursor lesions and formulate prevention strategies.

[PMID: 41171531] Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a recognized risk factor for gastric cancer (GC), which is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. As a Class I carcinogen, H. pylori plays a central role in the occurrence and development of GC. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of metabolic reprogramming inthe gastric cancer, and H. pylori infection has been shown to significantly alter metabolic pathways in gastric cancer. This review explores the mechanisms by which H. pylori infection drives metabolic changes in GC, particularly in glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. By altering these metabolisms, H. pylori enhances the survival, proliferation, and metastasis of tumor cells, and also promotes immune evasion. Therefore, understanding the ways in which H. pylori-induced metabolic reprogramming of GC cells is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets. By summarizing the latest research progress of these metabolic pathways, new strategies and directions can be provided for gastric cancer treatment.

[PMID: 41168783] Descriptive data on gastric cancer (GC) from African countries are limited. We describe the prevalence, clinicopathological features, short-term outcomes and factors associated with gastric cancer at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), which is a tertiary-level facility in Tanzania. This cross-sectional study enrolled consenting patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent diagnostic upper endoscopy at MNH from September 2023 to February 2024. The participants were followed up for 90 days to determine whether they died or developed gastrointestinal bleeding or gastric outlet obstruction. Sociodemographic and clinicopathological data were collected through a questionnaire and analysed via SPSS software. The prevalence of gastric cancer and short-term outcomes are expressed as proportions. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the significance of the associations between predictor variables and gastric cancer. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 870 patients were included, 459 (52.8%) of whom were male. The mean (± SD) age of the participants was 53.3 (± 17.4) years. GC was observed in 77 (8.9%) patients, with a male to female ratio of 0.83:1 and a mean age of 59.4 (± 10.6) years. The symptoms associated with GC were upper abdominal pain in 71(92.2%), weight loss 39(50.6%), abdominal fullness 24(31.2%), and vomiting 23(29.9%). H. pylori antibody testing was positive in 63 (81.8%) GC patients. The antrum was the most common location for GC in 51 (66.2%) patients, with ulcerative morphology in 47 (61.0%) patients. Histologically, 72 patients (96.1%) had adenocarcinomas. H. pylori infection (aOR 4.711; 2.493-8.902; P < 0.001), and cigarette smoking (aOR 2.477; 1.453-4.221; P = 0.001) were independently associated with GC. The 90-day mortality rate was 45.5% (35/77). Within the 90-day follow-up period, 88.3% (68/77) of the patients received palliative care, and 9.1% (7/77) were eligible for curative treatment. The prevalence of gastric cancer among patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at Muhimbili National Hospital is high. Most patients have advanced disease at presentation, and the 90-day mortality rate is high. Cigarette smoking and H. pylori infection were independently associated with GC in this population.

[PMID: 41161812] In the context of dysbiosis, chronic inflammation, and carcinogenesis, non-Helicobacter pylori bacteria are becoming more widely acknowledged as significant contributors to stomach diseases. The stomach contains a variety of bacterial communities, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus species, Lactobacillus species, Prevotella species, Veillonella species, and Propionibacterium acnes, according to studies employing next-generation sequencing. Because of adaptation processes like urease activity, acid-tolerant metabolism, and biofilm development, these organisms can survive in acidic environments. While some, like Lactobacillus, can create metabolites like lactic acid that may impact carcinogenic nitrosation reactions, others, including F. nucleatum and Streptococcus, cause inflammation through immune activation and cytokine production. A known stomach carcinogen, N-nitroso compound, may be formed more frequently if nitrate-reducing bacteria proliferate. Following H. pylori eradication, dysbiosis frequently involves elevated abundance of these taxa, which may impact stomach cancer risk and mucosal integrity. The need for more comprehensive microbiome-targeted therapeutic approaches is highlighted by mounting evidence that non-H. pylori bacteria interact either antagonistically or synergistically with H. pylori and host factors, causing intestinal metaplasia, gastritis, and tumour progression, even though causality is still being investigated.

[PMID: 41156851] <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection represents a well-established risk factor for the development of gastric carcinogenesis, yet reliable clinical or endoscopic predictors of infection remain poorly defined. Identifying non-invasive or endoscopic markers of this infection could improve early detection, which is crucial for effective prevention and clinical management. This single-center study included 737 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. We compared clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic features between <i>H. pylori</i>-positive and <i>H. pylori</i>-negative individuals. A total of 263 with <i>H. pylori</i>-positive gastric biopsies and 474 with <i>H. pylori</i>-negative biopsies were enrolled in our study. Cerebrovascular disease (9.51% vs. 5.51%, <i>p</i> = 0.04, OR = 1.80), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM-22.05% vs. 15.86%, <i>p</i> = 0.04, OR 1.5), and alcohol consumption (18.96% vs. 9.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.00, OR = 2.28) were significantly more prevalent among <i>H. pylori</i>-positive patients. Heartburn was more commonly reported in <i>H. pylori</i>-negative individuals (23.77% vs. 15.38%, <i>p</i> = 0.01, OR = 0.58). Laboratory parameters showed no significant differences between groups. Regarding endoscopic findings, corporal erythema (26.92% vs. 16.17%, <i>p</i> = 0.00, OR = 1.91), corporal erosions (11.54% vs. 5.32%, <i>p</i> = 0.00, OR = 2.32), and submucosal hemorrhages (20.91% vs. 11.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.00, OR = 2.01) were associated with <i>H. pylori</i> infection. In the multivariate logistic regression models, alcohol consumption and corporal lesions remained independent predictors of <i>H. pylori</i>-associated gastritis, even after adjusting for age, sex, and PPI use. This study identifies alcohol consumption and specific corporal mucosal changes as novel, independent predictors of <i>H. pylori</i> infection. Heartburn was negatively associated with active <i>H. pylori</i> infection, while the rest of the symptoms did not predict infection or mucosal lesions. The laboratory parameters did not differ significantly between groups. These findings underscore the potential of targeted endoscopic evaluation and risk-based screening (particularly among T2DM and alcohol-consuming populations) to enhance early detection and management of <i>H. pylori</i>-associated disease.

[PMID: 41148704] (1) Background: Gastric cancer continues to pose a significant public health challenge, with its incidence influenced by various factors, including <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) infection. In Lebanon, data on <i>H. pylori</i> prevalence and its associated risk factors remain limited. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> infection among Lebanese outpatients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms undergoing gastroscopy, to explore correlations between the infection and demographic and clinical variables, and to evaluate the prevalence of associated conditions such as gastritis, duodenitis, and intestinal metaplasia. (2) Methods: Using a retrospective design, data from 786 patients admitted at a hospital in Beirut over a three-year period were extracted from records. (3) Results: The prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> infection was 29.6% despite 91.5% of patients showing signs of gastritis on endoscopy. The infection showed significant associations with erosive gastritis, non-erosive gastritis, mosaic gastritis, as well as with both erosive and non-erosive duodenitis. No significant relationships were observed between <i>H. pylori</i> and demographic factors, atrophic, or nodular gastritis. (4) Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of targeted testing and early eradication of <i>H. pylori</i> to manage gastritis effectively and reduce the risk of progression to more serious gastric conditions in the Lebanese population.

[PMID: 41126989] <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is an oncobacteria that infects about half of the world's population and has a well-established role in the etiology of gastric diseases. Lately, this infection has also been associated with extragastric diseases, such as neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, metabolic, hematological, and dermatological comorbidities. Elucidating risk factors for comorbidities can contribute to reducing mortality and public health costs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the association between <i>H. pylori</i> infection and extragastric comorbidities. This is a cross-sectional hospital-based case-control study that was conducted in Goiás from 2019 to 2022. The study patients were classified into <i>H. pylori</i>-negative and <i>H. pylori</i>-positive groups. A total of 156 participants were included in the study, and the prevalence of the bacteria was 45.5%. In the <i>H. pylori</i>-positive group, the most frequent diseases were hypertension, anemia, rheumatic disease, and diabetes. The presence of comorbidities was similar between the groups, with the exception of psychiatric illnesses. The male patients were more likely to be infected with <i>H. pylori</i> (odds ratios [ORs] = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.26-5.50), while the <i>H. pylori</i>-positive group was less likely to have psychiatric illnesses (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.11-0.92). The prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> infection was 45.5%, and males were more likely to be infected by the bacteria. The most frequent comorbidities in the <i>H. pylori</i>-positive group were hypertension, anemia, rheumatic disease, and diabetes. <i>H. pylori</i>-negative patients were more likely to have psychiatric illnesses.

[PMID: 41107336] Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and highlights the need for early detection of gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, which is a major risk factor. Early non-invasive and convenient diagnostic tools capable of capturing the dynamic molecular alterations during carcinogenesis and HP infection is needed. In this study, we use Raman spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms to detect different gastric lesions and HP infection condition with gastric juice samples. 133 patients from Peking University Third Hospital were involved and categorized into groups based on histopathological diagnosis: early gastric cancer (EGC), dysplasia (DYS), intestinal metaplasia (IM), and chronic superficial gastritis (CSG), with further classification based on HP infection. The stacked machine learning model demonstrated high diagnostic performance, achieving 90% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 97% specificity in distinguishing pathological stages, along with 96% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and 96% specificity in HP detection. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) model based on gastric juice Raman spectroscopy showed excellent discrimination capability, with an AUC of 0.98 for differentiating controls from patients with DYS and EGC. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy achieved an AUC of 0.95 in distinguishing control gastric mucosa from precancerous lesions (IM, DYS) and EGC. The approach offers a rapid, accurate, and minimally invasive diagnostic tool, demonstrating significant potential for clinical application in rapid and accurate detection of precancerous lesions, early gastric cancer, and HP infection.",10

[PMID: 41184752] Low phosphorus (P) use efficiency of rice, in spite of sufficient P present in soil (mainly as insoluble complex), and excessive use of phosphatic fertilizers by farmers may cause several issues including higher cost of cultivation and environmental pollution. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is one of the strategies for transcriptome/proteome diversity that help plants to optimize acquisition and mobilization of P. Comparative analysis of rice [Pusa-44 and its Near-Isogenic Line (NIL)-23] grown hydroponically under contrasting conditions (16 ppm and 0 ppm) until vegetative stage deciphered stress-induced alternative splicing regulated through Pup1 QTL. The modulation in alternative splicing in root and shoot of rice under stress can be attributed to the regulatory function of Pup1. In addition to a considerable increase in the number of genes showing up-regulated expression, ∼20 genes demonstrated differential expression as well as alternative splicing (with a decrease in root but increase in shoot) in NIL-23under stress. Increase in alternative splicing of transcripts for 'iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor', 'regulation of P homeostasis' in roots while 'serine hydroxymethyltransferase' and 'iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor' in shoot, particularly those associated with P homeostasis/P-starvation stress-responsive signaling pathway, were recorded in the case of NIL-23 under stress. Genes/transcripts, particularly those associated with biological process in roots, showing reversed (increased vs. decreased) level of splicing in NIL-23 (compared to that in its parent) on P-starvation confirmed regulatory role of the QTL. Better understanding of splicing event/gene/transcript and its regulation might provide novel strategies to modulate gene expression for nutrient homeostasis and enhancing stress resilience in crop plants.

[PMID: 41184265] Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in human diseases, yet their mechanisms of action in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remain largely unknown. In this study, the conserved mammalian circRNA circFCHO2 was shown to play critical roles in COPD. The expression level of circFCHO2 was significantly increased in COPD cell models, mouse models, and human lung tissue samples. Moreover, we demonstrated that circFCHO2 promotes epithelial‒mesenchymal transition (EMT) in bronchial epithelial cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Mechanistically, circFCHO2 binds to and facilitates the nuclear translocation of PTBP1, thereby inhibiting the splicing of GRN pre-mRNA, which reduces PGRN protein expression levels and activates the NF-κB pathway. This activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway regulates the expression of EMT and ECM remodeling-related proteins, leading to the occurrence of airway remodeling. circFCHO2 knockdown reverses cigarette smoke-induced emphysema and airway remodeling of COPD in mice. Overall, our study advanced the understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which circRNAs contribute to airway remodeling in COPD patients.

[PMID: 41183753] Low temperature impacts physiological adaptability of fish, especially those with weaker cold tolerance, potentially affecting growth, immunity and survival. After five generations of artificial domestication, a cold-tolerant strain of Takifugu obscurus with an extreme low temperature of 5°C has been successfully developed. It provides a valuable resource for exploring the mechanisms of cold tolerance in teleosts. Histological and transcriptomic analyses were integrated to investigate the gill responses in cold-tolerant (CT) and wild-type (WT) pufferfish under cold stress. CT gill tissue showed fewer lesions and remained more intact than WT. Based on the weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) revealed that fatty acid and glucose metabolism, which provide energy and antioxidant defense via insulin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, play a critical role in CT pufferfish under cold stress. In contrast, WT pufferfish exhibited weaker energy metabolism and stronger inflammation and apoptosis pathways, including the NOD-like receptor, the RIG-I-like receptor, and the apoptosis signaling pathway. Notably, both CT and WT pufferfish exhibited enrichment of the base excision repair and spliceosome pathways under cold stress. The number of RNA alternative splicing (AS) and RNA editing genes increased with decreasing temperature, and these genes were found to be enriched in canonical cold response pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PPAR, and mRNA surveillance. Integrating the interactome network of the genes with the results of WGCNA, AS and RNA editing, cold-acclimation genes such as ache, arsd, nectin4, polr3g, and prr5 were identified, which are known to be involved in redox, immunity, and energy regulation. These studies contribute to our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of cold stress and to the genetic breeding of cold tolerance in T. obscurus.

[PMID: 41183667] The life cycle of human papillomavirus (HPV) is intricate, and a lack of appropriate in vitro models for natural HPV infection has led to a dearth of effective treatments for infection and related tumors. The HPV life cycle is strictly dependent on the differentiation of epithelial cells. Therefore, in our previous study, we used conditional reprogramming(CR) technology to establish human vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia cell infected with HPV18 naturally (VIN18) and verified that HPV18 completes its viral life cycle in these cells. This article refers to it as VIN18. In this study, we utilize VIN18 to establish a 3D differentiation model that facilitates a time gradient of infection within raft-like organotypic cultures.Our findings clarify previous understanding of the interaction between HPV18 and the host during the viral physiological cycle. We observed that under undifferentiated conditions, ATM-CHK2 is not essential for the genomic stability of HPV18. However, the differentiation environment primarily activates HPV18 amplification via ATM/CHK2 signaling. CHK2 exerts negative feedback regulation on the activity of upstream ATM. Moreover, upregulation of p53 and p21 leads to a reduction in cyclin D1. Consequently, increased HPV18 E7 expression induces the re-entry of VIN18 cells into S phase, resulting in elevated expression of cyclin A2 and cyclin B1, which causes the cell cycle arrest in S phase/G2 phase, thereby supporting viral genome amplification. This study provides a valuable new model for HPV biology research and offers insights into the regulation of the HPV life cycle through the differentiation process.

[PMID: 41182900] Deoxyguanosine quadruplexes (G4s) form stable non-B-DNA structures that can affect transcription, replication, and genome stability. Depending on various factors including cation binding, G4s can fold into different topologies, which can be linked to distinct function. In cells, G4 folding, function, and unfolding is affected by proteins that specifically target G4s. Zuo1 is a G4-binding protein in yeast. To investigate Zuo1 binding and its consequences on G4 formation and topology, we characterized Zuo1's interaction with G4s, both in vitro and in vivo. The C-terminus (Zuo1348-433) of Zuo1 interacts with the G4s. We characterized this interaction by combining nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET), and in vivo experiments with G4IX that is located on yeast chromosome IX. The Zuo1-G4IX interaction stabilizes this G4 structure and triggers conformational shifts depending on the cation environment. The data presented here demonstrate that Zuo1 targets a specific conformation state of G4 IX, modulates G4 toppology.

[PMID: 41182475] The purpose of this study was to use a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to explore the causal link between hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis and ovarian cancer (OC). By leveraging genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from publicly available databases, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) representing genetic variants for both hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis and OC. We employed the inverse variance weighted method (IVW) to assess the association between hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis and the risk of OC. Further, we evaluated SNP heterogeneity using the Cochran's Q test and detected the presence of outlier SNPs using the MR-PRESSO test. To examine the pleiotropy of SNPs, we employed the MR-Egger intercept test. Additionally, a ""leave-one-out"" sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of individual SNPs on the MR results. Finally, we performed a reverse MR analysis to explore the possibility of reverse causality. The results of the IVW analysis indicated a causal relationship between hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis and OC, with hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis increasing the incidence of OC (p < 0.05). According to the MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO global tests, no horizontal pleiotropy was observed in this study (P > 0.05). Sensitivity analysis using ""leave-one-out"" method indicated the stability of these genetic variants. Our systematic analyses provide evidence supporting a potential causal relationship between hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis and the risk of OC.

[PMID: 41182015] Brucella abortus S19 is a widely used live attenuated vaccine strain for bovine brucellosis control; however, its long-term efficacy is challenged by genomic plasticity and adaptive mechanisms. This study presents a comprehensive comparative genomic and immunoinformatics analysis of a field strain (B. abortus S19, BAS19) isolated from an aborted cattle placenta 3 years post-vaccination in Erzurum, Turkey. Whole-genome sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore Technology, followed by genome assembly, functional annotation and comparative analyses against the reference strain (B. abortus S19, BAR19). Genomic variations, including 1153 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 120 insertions and 2501 deletions, were identified. Annotation revealed 772 hypothetical proteins in BAS19 compared to 604 in BAR19, with distinct differences in virulence-associated genes. Immunoinformatics analysis of 95 outer membrane proteins (OMPs) indicated significant antigenic variation, with 47 proteins exhibiting epitope loss and 11 displaying novel epitope gains. Beta-barrel structure prediction demonstrated a reduction in structural stability, with nine OMPs losing beta-barrel motifs, potentially influencing host-pathogen interactions. These findings highlight key genomic adaptations in BAS19 that may influence its immunogenic properties and vaccine efficacy. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of B. abortus genomic diversity, providing insights for the rational design of improved vaccines and therapeutics tailored to regional epidemiological needs.

[PMID: 41181104] Age-related accumulation of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), causing clonal hematopoiesis (CH), often precedes the development of hematologic malignancies. Chronic inflammation and aberrant cytokine expression that are common in aging, contribute to clonal expansion and genomic instability. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an (epi)genetically and physiologically diverse malignancy, characterized by clonal proliferation and incomplete differentiation of HSPCs. The innate immune system, with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), plays a pivotal role in maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis. Dysregulated signaling through PRRs disrupts hematopoiesis, fostering malignant cell proliferation. In addition, cytokines and interferons exert multifaceted effects on HSPCs, impacting their proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Therapeutic approaches targeting innate immune pathways, offer promising avenues for treating hematologic malignancies. Understanding the intricate crosstalk between innate immunity and hematopoiesis would provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for combating hematologic malignancies, offering hope for improved patient outcomes and survival. In this review, we discuss about the malfunctioning innate immune-inflammatory axes in the context of abnormal hematopoiesis and the therapeutic approaches that are utilizing/targeting these pathways with efficacy. This review delves into the derangements of innate immune and inflammatory pathways implicated in the development of AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), shedding light on the therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

[PMID: 41180818] We present the case of a 60-year-old male patient with a common B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who carried the rare t(8; 22)(p11; q11) <i>BCR</i>::<i>FGFR1</i> chromosomal translocation. The presence of the t(8; 22)(p11; q11) <i>BCR</i>::<i>FGFR1</i> translocation, identified by cytogenetics including Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is known for its association with aggressive disease. Given the dismal prognosis, an early search for a stem cell donor was initiated. The patient was treated according to the German Multicenter ALL (GMALL) Study Group consensus recommendations. The disease was refractory to the first cycle of induction chemotherapy. However, after the second induction, cytological remission was achieved. Nevertheless, minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity persisted (IGH rearrangement detected by PCR) after the first consolidation therapy, giving indication for a stem cell transplantation (SCT). Thirty days post-transplant, no MRD was detected, and complete chimerism was measured for the months following transplantation. However, the patient died in the context of severe graft-versus-host disease and infectious complications 6 months after the SCT. This case highlights the importance of detailed molecular analysis in the initial diagnostics of ALL. Identification of specific chromosomal translocations can provide critical insights for risk assessment and aid decision-making in intensify therapeutic approaches.

Genetic deficiency of mast cells leads to decreased weight gain in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.,Mast cell deficiency AND Weight gain AND Mouse model AND Diet-induced obesity,"27933062,25955205,41187358,41187274,41187216,41187206,41187191,41187159,41187132,41187108","[PMID: 27933062] Obesity-related adipose tissue (AT) inflammation that promotes metabolic dysregulation is associated with increased AT mast cell numbers. Mast cells are potent inducers of inflammatory responses and could potentially contribute to obesity-induced AT inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Conflicting findings were reported on obesity-related metabolic dysfunction in mast cell-deficient mice, thus creating a controversy that has not been resolved to date. Whereas traditional <i>Kit</i> hypomorphic mast cell-deficient strains featured reduced diet-induced obesity and diabetes, a <i>Kit</i>-independent model of mast cell deficiency, Cpa3<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, displayed no alterations in obesity and insulin sensitivity. Herein, we analyzed diet-induced obesity in <i>Mcpt5-Cre R-DTA</i> mice, in which the lack of mast cells is caused by a principle different from mast cell deficiency in Cpa3<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice or <i>Kit</i> mutations. We observed no difference between mast cell-deficient and -proficient mice in diet-induced obesity with regards to weight gain, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, metabolic parameters, hepatic steatosis, and AT or liver inflammation. We conclude that mast cells play no essential role in obesity and related pathologies.

[PMID: 25955205] Obesity, insulin resistance, and related pathologies are associated with immune-mediated chronic inflammation. Kit mutant mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and associated co-morbidities, and this phenotype has previously been attributed to their lack of mast cells. We performed a comprehensive metabolic analysis of Kit-dependent Kit(W/Wv) and Kit-independent Cpa3(Cre/+) mast-cell-deficient mouse strains, employing diet-induced or genetic (Lep(Ob/Ob) background) models of obesity. Our results show that mast cell deficiency, in the absence of Kit mutations, plays no role in the regulation of weight gain or insulin resistance. Moreover, we provide evidence that the metabolic phenotype observed in Kit mutant mice, while independent of mast cells, is immune regulated. Our data underscore the value of definitive mast cell deficiency models to conclusively test the involvement of this enigmatic cell in immune-mediated pathologies and identify Kit as a key hematopoietic factor in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.

[PMID: 41187358] Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an autoimmune disorder presents with bloody diarrhea. This responds well to conventional medicine including steroids but recurrences are frequent once the treatment is stopped. Present report is about a case of UC having frequent recurrence of symptoms with ongoing conventional medicine, having treated with Ayurveda interventions to the extent of remission like state followed up for over 1 year. The case proposes that Ayurveda interventions in refractory cases of UC can be of value to provide long term remission and sustained clinical relief. The patient treated here was a young girl having blood mixed loose stools 10-15 times a day and ongoing weight loss. With conventional treatment, there were partial responses followed by the recurrences once the treatment stopped. Endoscopic finding were suggestive of multiple ulcers in the colon and rectum. On the basis of clinical and endoscopic findings, the patient was diagnosed for UC. Considering it as aam-raktaj pravahika, Ayurveda interventions were individualized for the patient. Following the Ayurveda treatment for about 1 year, patient reported reduced frequency of stool with blood along with weight gain. Endoscopic observation after one year reveled no ulcers in the colon and rectum. This report suggests that in cases of refractory UC, it is worth trying other therapeutic options like Ayurveda as these may provide additional relief and reduced frequency of relapses. Based upon such observations, more systematic clinical trials are required to be planned to evaluate these therapeutic options in cases of UC.

[PMID: 41187274] Pregnancy induces a range of physiological and musculoskeletal changes that can lead to orthopedic issues. This article examines etiologies and management strategies for outpatient orthopedic problems encountered during pregnancy. Hormonal changes, weight gain, and altered biomechanics contribute to common musculoskeletal complaints such as low back pain, pelvic girdle pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Although less common, osteoporosis can present during pregnancy. Additionally, domestic violence and interpartner violence are disproportionately more frequent in this population. This review highlights evidence-based approaches for diagnosis and treatment and emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary care, including obstetricians, orthopedic surgeons, endocrinologists, primary care physicians, and physical therapists.

[PMID: 41187216] Many taxa have independently evolved genetic sex determination where a single gene located on a sex chromosome controls gonadal differentiation. The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex-reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the ""Four Core Genotypes"" model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.

[PMID: 41187206] Fast skeletal muscle fibers from zebrafish share a number of functional properties with mammalian twitch muscle fibers, making this vertebrate a precious model to investigate the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders. We previously reported that action potentials (APs) from zebrafish fast fibers exhibit low amplitude and require unusually strong negative resting membrane voltage levels to be elicited. In this study, using voltage-clamp and current-clamp techniques, we explored the properties of voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV) responsible for initiation and propagation of AP in isolated adult zebrafish fast skeletal muscle fibers and compared them to mouse fast-twitch muscle fibers using the same experimental conditions. We found that kinetics of activation and inactivation of NaV were faster in zebrafish fibers and, overall, that the voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted by 25 mV toward negative voltages as compared to mouse fibers, yielding a mean half-inactivation potential of -90 mV. In agreement with these findings, recording of APs at various resting membrane potentials indicated that APs vanished for resting membrane potentials less negative than -80 mV in zebrafish, whereas APs could still be elicited from resting membrane potentials as low as -60 mV in mice. In addition, Ca2+ transients induced by field stimulation were insensitive to Na+ current blockade in zebrafish but not in mouse fibers. Fluorescence labeling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors showed that zebrafish fast fibers were multi-innervated with a mean distance between extra-synaptic sarcolemma and motor endplates of 14 µm, expected to lead to negligible attenuation of depolarization propagated from endplates. Finally, knock out of the two genes encoding pore-forming NaV subunits in zebrafish muscles did not induce any change in locomotion and escape behavior of the animals. Taken together, these data question the role of NaV and the occurrence of APs in zebrafish fast muscle.

[PMID: 41187191] Severe viral and bacterial pneumonia are among the most common causes of death worldwide. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1)'s on methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)-induced severe pneumonia following cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. A young mouse model of severe pneumonia was established using Staphylococcus aureus and CMV. LTBP1 overexpression was induced, and pathological changes in lung tissue were assessed through H&E staining. Serum levels of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and interleukin (IL)-1β, were measured using ELISA. Bacterial load in the lungs was quantified, and protein expression levels of LTBP1, TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad3, and p-Smad3 in lung tissue were analyzed using Western blot. The LTBP1 expression was reduced in the young mouse model of severe pneumonia induced by Staphylococcus aureus after cytomegalovirus reactivation. Overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited lung damage, reduced serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and decreased bacterial load in the lungs. Additionally, overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. LTBP1 efficiently reduces severe pneumonia by activating the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating this condition.

[PMID: 41187159] Adolescent opioid use in the United States commands attention: millions of twelve- to nineteen-year-olds are exposed to opioids each year by prescription and misuse. Recent findings show that opioids bind not only to canonical opioid receptors but also interact with receptors on immune cells within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The potential for early life opioid exposure to give rise to long-term changes in the neuroimmune system is not fully understood, particularly given the adolescent brain's high susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that adolescent opioid use potentiates physiological and behavioral responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness later in life. To achieve this, we treated adolescent (postnatal day 35-42) male and female C57/BL6 mice with saline or bi-daily escalating doses of morphine for 5 days to model opioid dependence and, in adulthood (postnatal day 60-67), administered saline or a low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) to promote an immune response. Body weight, body surface temperature, and locomotor activity were recorded up to 48 hours after LPS administration. Mice were also tested in the forced swim test 52 hours after LPS administration to assess depressive-like behavior. In contrast to our hypotheses, we found that adolescent morphine exposure had no additive effect on low-dose LPS-induced sickness measures when assessed in adulthood. These data suggest that adolescent opioid exposure may have minimal effects on future immune challenges, although further research is needed to confirm this.

[PMID: 41187132] The global rise in overweight and obesity poses significant public health challenges, contributing to premature mortality and preventable disabilities. Moreover, efforts to increase reproductive autonomy through the promotion of modern contraceptive methods are underway, with persisting concerns regarding their potential influence on weight gain. This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with overweight and obesity and to examine the mediating role of hormonal contraceptive usage among Ghanaian women of reproductive age. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using secondary data from the 2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, which involved 6,181 women aged 20 years and above. The data was cleaned and analysed with Stata Corp version 18. Associations between overweight/obesity and various sociodemographic factors were assessed, and survey-adjusted logistic regression model was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios. Survey-adjusted mediation analysis was performed via structural equation modelling to evaluate the indirect effects of hormonal contraceptives use on the relationships between the independent variables and BMI. The analysis revealed that factors such as age, highest educational attainment, marital status, religion, residential status, region, nature of employment, and wealth quintile were significantly associated with high BMI with the exception of contraceptive usage. The results of the mediation showed that, hormonal contraceptives had no significant indirect role on the relationship between high BMI and its covariates. The study revealed several determinants of high BMI, however, hormonal contraceptives neither directly nor indirectly influenced high BMI. Whereas, there is the need to integrate weight management counselling into family planning for general well-being, there is the need to intensify education to dispel misconception about the weight gain associated with the usage of hormonal contraceptives to maximize the uptake of contraceptives and improve the overall health of women in Ghana.

[PMID: 41187108] Sensory processing is dynamically modulated by an animal's behavior and internal states. Growing evidence suggests that such modulation starts from early stages, already at the retina, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Combining pharmacological and chemogenetic tools with single-unit extracellular recordings in awake head-fixed mice, here we identified that the visual responses of retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus were both made weaker and slower by histaminergic projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus. The observed changes in the visual responses were, however, not directly linked with histaminergic modulation of pupil dynamics or locomotion behavior. Instead, our computational modeling analysis suggests that the temporal response modulations arise from changes in the intrinsic properties of the circuit, such as gain modulation via the histamine H1 receptors in the retina. Facilitation of visual processing at low histamine levels may offer an ethological advantage, enabling animals to respond rapidly to visual threats during periods of reduced activity.",10

Genetic deletion of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) reverses intestinal hyperpermeability and improves survival in a murine model of intra-abdominal sepsis. In an attempt to determine whether these findings could be translated using a more clinically relevant strategy, this study aimed to determine if pharmacologic inhibition of MLCK using the membrane permeant inhibitor of MLCK (PIK) improved gut barrier function and survival following sepsis. C57BL/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture to induce sepsis and were then randomized to receive either PIK or vehicle. Unexpectedly, PIK significantly worsened 7-day survival following sepsis (24% vs. 62%). The three pathways of intestinal permeability were then interrogated by orally gavaging septic mice with creatinine (6Å), FD-4 (28Å), and rhodamine70 (120Å) and assaying their appearance in the bloodstream. PIK led to increased permeability in the leak pathway with higher levels of FD-4 in the bloodstream compared to septic mice given vehicle. In contrast, no differences were detected in the pore or unrestricted pathways of permeability. Examination of jejunal tight junctions for potential mechanisms underlying increased leak permeability revealed that mice that received PIK had increased phosphorylated MLC without alterations in occludin, ZO-1, or JAM-A. PIK administration was not associated with significant differences in systemic or peritoneal bacterial burden, cytokines, splenic or Peyer's Patches immune cells or intestinal integrity. These results demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of MLCK unexpectedly increases mortality, associated with worsened intestinal permeability through the leak pathway, and suggest caution is required in targeting the gut barrier as a potential therapy in sepsis.

[PMID: 28598488] Sepsis-induced intestinal hyperpermeability is mediated by disruption of the epithelial tight junction, which is closely associated with the peri-junctional actin-myosin ring. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates the myosin regulatory light chain, resulting in increased permeability. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic deletion of MLCK would alter gut barrier function and survival from sepsis. MLCK<sup>-/-</sup> and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture and assayed for both survival and mechanistic studies. Survival was significantly increased in MLCK<sup>-/-</sup> mice (95% vs. 24%, p<0.0001). Intestinal permeability increased in septic WT mice compared to unmanipulated mice. In contrast, permeability in septic MLCK<sup>-/-</sup> mice was similar to that seen in unmanipulated animals. Improved gut barrier function in MLCK<sup>-/-</sup> mice was associated with increases in the tight junction mediators ZO-1 and claudin 15 without alterations in claudin 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, occludin or JAM-A. Other components of intestinal integrity (apoptosis, proliferation and villus length) were unaffected by MLCK deletion as were local peritoneal inflammation and distant lung injury. Systemic IL-10 was decreased greater than 10-fold in MLCK<sup>-/-</sup> mice; however, survival was similar between septic MLCK<sup>-/-</sup> mice given exogenous IL-10 or vehicle. These data demonstrate that deletion of MLCK improves survival following sepsis, associated with normalization of intestinal permeability and selected tight junction proteins.

[PMID: 41187071] To develop a low-cost, environmentally friendly taurine fermentation method for sustainable marine fish culture using feed derived from photosynthetically produced agricultural products, it is crucial to study cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), a key enzyme in the taurine biosynthetic pathway in applicable microorganisms. In this study, a method was devised to screen for CSAD genes using <i>Escherichia coli</i> growth as an indicator, based on sulfur assimilation following the decarboxylation of l-cysteic acid, a taurine precursor compound. The <i>E. coli</i> used has a double deletion mutation of <i>cysA</i> (sulfate/thiosulfate ABC transporter) and <i>ssuD</i> (FMNH<sub>2</sub>-dependent alkanesulfonate monooxygenase) genes. If needed, an additional defect in enzyme genes, such as <i>cysC</i> (adenylyl-sulfate kinase), which participates in the pathway reducing sulfate to sulfite, is also introduced. Using this method, it was demonstrated that the glutamic acid decarboxylase gene from <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> possesses CSAD activity. The identified decarboxylase was further confirmed to act on l-cysteine sulfinic acid. Additionally, two observations made during method refinement to reduce background growth in screening are discussed: that SsuD is involved in sulfur assimilation from an unknown sulfur compound and that certain <i>mscK</i> (mechanosensitive channel) missense mutations enable external sulfate above a specific concentration to enter the cell.

[PMID: 41187059] The intestinal mucus layer produced by goblet cells is a critical component of innate immunity. The key host factors and regulatory mechanisms controlling goblet cell function in mucus layer formation remain poorly understood. This study identifies a function for the microprotein FXYD domain-containing transport regulator 3 (FXYD3) in goblet cells in regulating mucus layer formation to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Deficiency of FXYD3 in mouse intestinal epithelial cells results in a damaged mucus barrier, leading to dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to colitis. Mechanistically, FXYD3 interacts with endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase SERCA2 to enhance its pump activity. FXYD3 deficiency causes defects in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and mucin glycosylation, impairing mucus layer integrity. Furthermore, metabolites of gut microbiota, propionate, and butyrate promote FXYD3 expression. In ulcerative colitis patients, FXYD3 expression is significantly downregulated and correlates with disease severity. These findings indicate FXYD3 is a key mediator of host-microbiota interactions for intestinal health.

[PMID: 41186894] Antimicrobial peptides (APs) are increasingly used in livestock production because of their effective antibacterial properties and low risk of causing drug resistance. However, their effects on intestinal barrier function in ruminants remain relatively unexplored. This study explored the effect of composite APs on colonic microbiota and barrier integrity in Holstein steers. Twelve steers were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 6): a control (CK) group that received a basal diet and an AP group that received the same diet supplemented with 8 g/ (d· head) of APs over a 270-day feeding period. After humanely killing, colonic tissue and contents were collected for analysis using histology, 16S rRNA sequencing, and metabolomics. The AP group demonstrated significantly increased mucosal thickness and mucin secretion (p < 0.05), enhanced activities of β-glucosidase, lipase, xylanase, cellulase, and pectinase (p < 0.01), elevated acetate, propionate, and butyrate levels (p < 0.05), upregulated polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) expression at both gene and protein levels (p < 0.05), reduced α-amylase activity (p < 0.01), and decreased density and abundance of immunoglobulin (Ig)A<sup>+</sup>, IgG<sup>+</sup> and IgM<sup>+</sup> cell clusters (p < 0.05). Additionally, AP supplementation induced functional reorganization of the intestinal microbiota. Microbial analysis indicated increased growth of beneficial bacteria, particularly Firmicutes and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, but a selective decrease in potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Metabolomic analysis suggested elevated lithocholic acid levels and modified lipid metabolism in the AP group. Correlation analysis demonstrated that alterations in colonic microbiota and metabolites were associated with enhanced intestinal barrier function. Hence, AP supplementation promotes intestinal health in Holstein steers by modulating epithelial development and microbial community composition.

[PMID: 41186792] Estrogen is classically considered an essential hormone signal and exerts profound effects on several physiological and pathological states, including gut health. Estrogen deficiency after menopause in most women leads to increased androgenicity and changes in body composition. It is recommended to manipulate the composition of gut bacteria, which alters gut integrity and hence leads to gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis. Normally, the gut maintains its epithelial microvilli integrity with the help of intestinal barriers, such as tight junction (TJ) proteins (claudin, occludin, and epithelial cadherin), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, formic acid, and butyric acid), and mucin. Estrogen influences the bacteria present in the gut. It appears to safeguard the integrity of the gut by inhibiting the breakdown of SCFAs, TJ proteins, and mucin. This protective mechanism serves to prevent the onset of dysbiosis. The estrobolome specialises in the processing of estrogen, playing a pivotal role in regulating estrogen metabolism within the gut. This imbalance is intricately linked to alterations in the estrobolome and endobolome, thereby influencing estrogen metabolism and availability. The estrogen deficiency and associated expressions of TJ proteins, SCFAs, and mucin advance the progression of postmenopausal-induced gynaecological disorders. However, the alterations in the composition and diversity of GM observed during menopause emphasize the pivotal role of estrogen in shaping the gut environment. Estrogen intricately regulates the estrobolome, TJ proteins, mucin, and SCFAs. Via this review, we have tried our best to enlighten on the detailed mechanisms showing the crosslink between estrogen and gut health.

[PMID: 41186416] Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes severe intestinal disease in piglets, employs sophisticated strategies to subvert host antiviral immunity. While type III interferons (IFN-III) play a pivotal role in mucosal defense at intestinal epithelial barriers, the mechanisms underlying PEDV evasion of IFN-III signaling remain poorly understood. Given that peroxisomes serve as critical platforms for IFN-III signaling and that their abundance influences immune activation, we investigated the role of pexophagy in PEDV-mediated immune evasion. We demonstrated that the PEDV nonstructural protein NSP8 functions as a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-dependent IFN-III production. Functional analyses revealed that NSP8 significantly reduces peroxisomal protein levels and promotes pexophagy. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry identified a direct interaction between NSP8 and PEX13. NSP8 also induces dose-dependent degradation of PEX13 via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. This downregulation of PEX13 triggers ubiquitination of the peroxisomal import receptor PEX5, facilitating its recognition by the autophagy receptor NBR1 and the ubiquitin ligase PEX2, thereby promoting autophagic clearance of peroxisomes. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel immune evasion strategy in which PEDV exploits NSP8 to disrupt peroxisome homeostasis by targeting PEX13, thereby dismantling MAVS-dependent IFN-III antiviral signaling through pexophagy. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) NSP8 is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in viral replication. Investigating the functional mechanisms of NSP8 contributes to a deeper understanding of PEDV pathogenesis and supports the development of antiviral strategies against coronaviruses. In this study, we elucidate how NSP8 suppresses type Ⅲ interferon (IFN-Ⅲ) production by promoting pexophagy through the downregulation of PEX13. We demonstrate that NSP8 directly interacts with PEX13 and enhances the ubiquitination of PEX5, leading to reduced peroxisome abundance and impaired mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated IFN-Ⅲ signaling. These findings suggest that NSP8 hijacks the PEX13-dependent pexophagy pathway as a means of evading host antiviral defenses. This work provides critical insights into the interplay between viral proteins and host cellular machinery and highlights the NSP8-PEX13 axis as a promising target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing antiviral immunity against PEDV and related coronaviruses.

[PMID: 41186249] Biological barriers in our body are dedicated to maintaining systemic homeostasis by enabling selective transport, the dysregulation of which plays a pathogenic role in several diseases. Transendothelial/epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) analysis is conventionally used to assess the barrier permeability. Engineering TEER setups within advanced in vitro models has become essential for acquiring real-time information on barrier integrity inside organ-on-a-chip (OOC) devices. However, current approaches often involve multiple assembly steps, require external access to the culture chamber, rely on cumbersome systems, or provide highly localized measurements that do not represent the entire surface of the tissue under examination. Specifically, in Transwell-based OOC systems, continuous and nondisruptive monitoring is often precluded by the need to disassemble the system for TEER measurement. To address these limitations, we combined conventional technology for patterning thin conductive films with low-cost, benchtop 3D printing to integrate planar electrodes within a Transwell-based hybrid OOC system. Our integrated TEER electrode device, ITE-MINERVA, can be easily employed with commercial measurement instruments, representing a useful tool for real-time, in situ detection of barrier functionality, potentially altered by drug toxicity and absorption processes, on Transwell-based OOCs, both in single- and multiorgan configurations, noninvasively and without stopping the experiment. In this work, we present the design and fabrication strategy of our innovative setup and its assessment in recording real-time TEER modulation on a Caco-2 cell-based in vitro gut epithelial barrier model.

[PMID: 41186005] Aeromonas hydrophila-induced bacterial sepsis is a major threat to aquaculture, characterised by excessive inflammation, ferroptosis (an iron-dependent lipid peroxidation-driven cell death) and oxidative damage, which collectively lead to high mortality. Taurine (TAU) and glutathione (GSH) have been demonstrated to have potential therapeutic efficacy against ferroptosis-associated pathologies through redox modulation. However, their combined effects and underlying mechanisms in alleviating A. hydrophila infection remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the protective roles of TAU, GSH and their combination in vitro using yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) macrophages and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) kidney (CIK) cells and in vivo using yellow catfish challenged with A. hydrophila. The results showed that TAU and GSH, either alone or in combination, alleviated oxidative stress by significantly reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and inhibited nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway activation. This led to downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β), accompanied by alleviated ferroptosis. In vivo, dietary supplementation with TAU (10 g/kg) or GSH (350 mg/kg) alone improved survival rates (51.7% and 38.3%, respectively), reduced tissue bacterial loads and protected intestinal and hepatic tissues by preserving mucosal barrier function. However, the TAU + GSH combination unexpectedly decreased survival (28.3%) due to excessive immunosuppression (overproduction of IL-10 and TGF-β) and impaired mucosal barrier, which exacerbated pathogen colonisation. Together, our findings demonstrate that TAU and GSH alleviate A. hydrophila-induced oxidative stress by reducing mitochondrial ROS overproduction and disrupting the ROS/NF-κB signalling pathway, thereby attenuating inflammatory cytokine storms and ferroptosis. These results provide novel insights into the pathological mechanisms of bacterial sepsis in fish and develop sustainable strategies to improve disease resistance in aquaculture.

[PMID: 41185940] When a percutaneous metallic implant breaches the skin barrier, the lack of peri-implant soft tissue sealing arising from a foreign body reaction and epithelial downgrowth results in delayed wound healing and closure. This facilitates microbial pathogen entry, leading to infection, inflammation, and ultimately, peri-implantitis. Toward this end, bioglue formulations of -human hair keratin (HHK) and chicken feather keratin coupled with polyphenols, dopamine (DOPA), quercetin (Q), and tannic acid (TA) were developed for peri-implant soft tissue sealing. A freeze-thaw gelation mediated by thiol recombination of reduced keratins was employed for attachment of soft tissue (porcine intestine) to titanium. Lap shear tests revealed that the adhesion strength of reduced keratins improved with polyphenol addition, with a maximal glue strength exhibited by HHK + TA (10:1 w/w) when applied between the porcine intestine and titanium. Rheological characterization ascertained shear-thinning behavior and injectability of the glues into wet aqueous media and dry surfaces. Despite inferior glue strength to commercial ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate bioglue, the keratin ± polyphenol glues were more skin compatible, evidenced by greater viability and proliferation of immortalized human skin epidermal keratinocytes (<i>HaCaT</i>) and equine dermal fibroblasts (<i>E. Derm NBL6</i>). Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of keratin ± polyphenol glue formulations conferred greater anti-inflammatory activity in bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. Taken together, the application of keratin ± polyphenol glues for soft tissue sealing may be a promising approach to mitigate peri-implantitis around transcutaneous metallic prostheses.",10

While protein-coding genes have taken center stage for decades, attention has significantly shifted toward the silent majority of the human genome, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Aberrant ncRNA expression is closely linked to critical processes involved in cancer, including cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. As such, ncRNAs represent promising targets for cancer therapy and are critical molecular markers for cancer prediction and prognosis, providing guidance for clinical decision-making. Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), tRNA-derived small RNAs (tRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), arerdysregulatedarious cancers. These molecules can influence cancer progression through various mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications, epigenetics, and signal transduction pathways. Therefore, these small molecules hold significant promise as cancer biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. RNA technology offers promise as a therapeutic intervention for targeted gene silencing in cancer, and several RNA-based formulations are being evaluated in clinical trials for this purpose. Therefore, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of cancer development, identifying specific therapeutic targets, and developing effective drug delivery systems are essential. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms is also significant for the future development of RNA-targeted therapies. Carrier systems that facilitate the effective and safe delivery of small noncoding RNA-based therapeutics are crucial for successful clinical applications. RNA therapeutics must be delivered to the relevant organ and cell type and efficiently across the cell membrane to perform their intracellular functions. However, achieving therapeutic success requires a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving cancer, precise identification of therapeutic targets, and development of efficient and safe delivery systems for these agents. This review examines the biogenesis of sncRNAs, their mechanisms of action, nanoformulation strategies, and studies focusing on sncRNA delivery systems. In addition, we present the cancer-fighting potential of RNA and RNA-related therapies and examine the current status of sncRNA therapeutics in the clinical trials.

[PMID: 41000388] Ovarian cancer remains the deadliest gynecological malignancy with 5-year survival rates below 40% due to frequent recurrence and chemoresistance. Aberrant crotonylation, a type of epigenetic modification, has been implicated in the proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion of various cancers. However, its role in the ovarian cancer microenvironment and clinical outcomes remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model for ovarian cancer on the basis of crotonylation and to investigate the underlying mechanisms and potential of crotonylation for targeted therapy. We systematically analyzed single-cell RNA-seq and bulk transcriptomic datasets from ovarian cancer patients. Cellular crotonylation activity was quantified using AUCell algorithm. Potential prognostic genes were identified through DEG analysis and Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and the associated molecular mechanisms were elucidated via Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). An ovarian cancer prognosis model were constructed by integrating machine learning algorithms. Immune microenvironment features were assessed using CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE and TIDE algorithms, with drug sensitivity predicted via genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer. The ovarian cancer microenvironment is characterized by abundant immune cell infiltration, with significant differences in crotonylation levels among 7 cell subtypes. We identified 451 key crotonylation-related genes. The crotonylation risk score (RS) model demonstrated robust prognostic performance. High-RS groups showed immunosuppressive characteristics: decreased follicular helper T cells and activated NK cells, concomitant with M2 macrophage enrichment. Elevated RS was associated with increased stromal activation, as indicated by a higher ESTIMATE score, and enhanced immune evasion potential, reflected by an elevated TIDE score. Notably, high-RS patients exhibited upregulated PDL1 and CD40, suggesting increased immunotherapy susceptibility. Pharmacogenomic analysis identified vinblastine with differential sensitivity, providing actionable targets for RS-stratified therapy. We elucidated the significant impact of crotonylation on the ovarian cancer microenvironment and prognosis. We developed and validated a novel prognostic model for ovarian cancer that can serve as a tool for predicting patient outcomes and characterizing the immune microenvironment. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of crotonylation in ovarian cancer and establish a robust framework for developing therapeutic strategies targeting crotonylation.

[PMID: 40931149] Aberrant DNA methylation has been described in nearly all human cancers, yet its interplay with genomic alterations during tumor evolution is poorly understood. To explore this, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on 217 tumor and matched normal regions from 59 patients with non-small cell lung cancer from the TRACERx study to deconvolve tumor methylation. We developed two metrics for integrative evolutionary analysis with DNA and RNA sequencing data. Intratumoral methylation distance quantifies intratumor DNA methylation heterogeneity. M<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>N</sub> classifies genes based on the rate of hypermethylation at regulatory (M<sub>R</sub>) versus nonregulatory (M<sub>N</sub>) CpGs to identify driver genes exhibiting recurrent functional hypermethylation. We identified DNA methylation-linked dosage compensation of essential genes co-amplified with neighboring oncogenes. We propose two complementary mechanisms that converge for copy number alteration-affected chromatin to undergo the epigenetic equivalent of an allosteric activity transition. Hypermethylated driver genes under positive selection may open avenues for therapeutic stratification of patients.

[PMID: 40775769] A key to understanding cancer is to determine the impact on the cellular pathways caused by the repertoire of DNA changes accrued in a cancer cell. Exploring the interactions between genomic aberrations and the expressed transcriptome can not only improve our understanding of the disease but also identify potential therapeutic approaches. Using random forest models, we successfully identified transcriptional patterns associated with the loss of wild-type activity in cancer-related genes across various tumour types. While genes like TP53 and CDKN2A exhibited unique pan-cancer transcriptional patterns, others like ATRX, BRAF, and NRAS showed tumour-type-specific expression patterns. We also observed that genes like AR and ERBB4 did not lead to strong detectable patterns in the transcriptome when disrupted. Our investigation has also led to the identification of genes highly associated with transcriptional patterns. For instance, DRG2 emerged as the top contributor in classification of ATRX alterations in lower-grade gliomas and was significantly downregulated in ATRX mutant tumours. Additionally, transcriptional features important in classification of PTEN aberrations, such as CDCA8, AURKA, and CDC20, were found to be closely related to PTEN function. Our findings demonstrate the utility of machine learning in interpretation of cancer genomic data and provide new avenues for development of targeted therapies tailored to individual patients with cancer. Our analysis on the transcriptome revealed genes with expression levels strongly correlated with alterations in cancer-related genes. Additionally, we identified AURKA inhibitors as potential therapeutic option for tumours with alterations in tumour suppressors like FBXW7 or NSD1.

[PMID: 40759888] Epstein-Barr virus, the first identified human DNA tumour virus, is detectable in more than 90% of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients in endemic regions. The 3D chromosome conformation analysis reveals that virus‒host chromatin interactions induce the spatial reorganisation of loops and compartments, resulting in ""enhancer infestation"" and switch of ""H3K27 bivalency"" at EBV-interacting regions. Through this mechanism, EBV hijacks KDM5B, a gatekeeper of genome stability, and its binding targets, leading to aberrant activation of an EBVIR-enhancer-KDM5B signature. Cancer cells with this signature present increased MYC activation, DNA damage responses, and epigenetic plasticity of epithelial-immune dual features with metastatic potential. Our multicentre multiomics study confirms that this signature is the prerequisite for chromosome instability and can be utilised as a risk factor for distant metastasis. This study highlights a mechanism in which latent viral episomes can alter the host high-order epigenotype, promoting transcriptional rewiring and metastasis in NPC.

[PMID: 40715090] Resistance to multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is a major clinical concern in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we aimed to uncover the mechanisms underlying pan-TKI resistance and to identify potential therapeutic targets. We used multiple TKI-resistant HCC cell lines to identify caveolin-1 (CAV1) as a key driver of therapeutic resistance. CAV1 downregulation induced apoptosis, inhibited metastasis and restored TKI sensitivity in both inherent and acquired TKI-resistant HCC cells. Mechanistically, in acquired TKI-resistant cells aberrant CAV1/STAT3/P70S6K signalling is required for their survival, motility, and invasiveness. CAV1 inhibition reduced expression of dormancy regulators E-cadherin, RAC1 and p21, enhanced cancer stemness markers, and disrupted downstream STAT3/P70S6K and AMPKα signalling pathways, prompting cancer cells to exit from dormancy and initiate autophagy-induced cell death. Furthermore, selective inhibition of AXL and FGFR4 downstream of the CAV1 pathway sensitized TKI-resistant cells to sorafenib and lenvatinib, respectively. In addition, microRNA-7-5p (miR-7) was identified as an endogenous regulator of CAV1; and miR-7's inhibitory effect on CAV1 and FGFR4 suppressed the STAT3/P70S6K pathway, promoted autophagy and triggered apoptosis in lenvatinib-resistant cells. Combination therapy using either lenvatinib or sorafenib and selective CAV1 inhibitors (e.g., siCAV1/miR-7), or AXL/FGFR4 inhibitors (e.g., BGB324/BLU9931) effectively overcame pan-TKI resistance. In HCC patient datasets, elevated CAV1 mRNA was observed in sorafenib non-responders, and single cell RNA-sequencing of HCC patient tumours revealed a rare population of CAV1+ cancer cells associated with recurrence. High CAV1 expression was specific to HBV+ HCC patients and independently predicted poor survival. Further, targeting of CAV1, AXL or FGFR4 effectively overcame TKI resistance in HCC patient derived organoids (PDOs). Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized role for CAV1-driven signalling in sustaining tumour dormancy, a critical and challenging therapeutic barrier underlying recurrence and pan-TKI resistance in HCC. Therapeutically targeting these pathways offer a promising and novel strategy to eliminate dormant tumour cells, thereby overcoming resistance and improving treatment outcomes.

[PMID: 40713639] Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) have long been recognized as critical regulators of chromatin dynamics and gene expression, with aberrations in these processes driving tumorigenesis, immune escape, metastasis, and therapy resistance. While multi-omics technologies are generating ever more detailed maps of the histone landscape, translating these insights into clinical practice remains challenging. The ongoing convergence of high-throughput omics technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing drug repositioning strategies, offering new precision tools to identify histone-targeted therapies for solid tumors. In this review, we explore how AI-driven multi-omics integration is currently reshaping therapeutic opportunities by uncovering novel drug-target-patient associations with unprecedented accuracy. Special focus is given to gynecologic and breast cancers, where chromatin remodeling dysregulation is particularly widespread, conventional therapeutic approaches have demonstrated substantial limitations and drug resistance represents a major clinical obstacle. These aggressive and lethal cancers exemplify areas where AI-powered repurposing of epi-drugs is making tangible clinical advances, enhancing tumor sensitivity to treatments like immunotherapy, but also offering new avenues to overcome challenging phenomena such as drug resistance and cancer relapse. We critically discuss these challenges and the effectiveness of a combination strategy approaches based on AI-driven patient stratification and biomarker-guided therapy optimization to maximize clinical benefits. In an era where precision oncology demands both specific drugs and the application of smarter strategies, the integration of AI, multi-omics, and targeting of chromatin remodelers may herald a transformative shift in the management of solid tumors, bridging the gap between biological insights and therapeutic innovation.

[PMID: 40657395] ACTL6A, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, has emerged as a critical oncogenic driver across multiple malignancies. Recent studies reveal that aberrant ACTL6A overexpression promotes tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis by orchestrating chromatin remodeling, transcriptional reprogramming, and crosstalk with key signaling pathways (e.g., Hippo/YAP, Notch, and PI3K/AKT). This review systematically synthesizes evidence from <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, and clinical studies spanning hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, glioblastoma, and 10 other cancer types, highlighting ACTL6A's dual role as a chromatin remodeler and an independent oncogenic effector. Key mechanisms include sustaining cancer stemness, suppressing apoptosis, enhancing DNA repair, and driving metabolic reprogramming. Clinically, ACTL6A overexpression correlates with advanced tumor stage, therapy resistance, and poor prognosis, positioning it as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. We further discuss emerging strategies to inhibit ACTL6A (e.g., siRNA, small-molecule inhibitors) and propose combinatorial approaches to overcome drug resistance. By integrating multi-omics data and preclinical models, this review not only clarifies ACTL6A's context-dependent oncogenic networks but also bridges mechanistic insights to translational challenges, offering a roadmap for future research and therapeutic development.

[PMID: 40505420] The analysis of tumor DNA by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly utilized for the identification of clinically relevant DNA aberrations. We aim to assess whether WGS improves the guidance of individualized systemic therapy in soft tissue sarcoma (STS). WGS results of STS patients were retrieved from electronic patient records and pathology reports from clinical studies and routine diagnostics. WGS was carried out in primary STS with an unfavorable prognosis, metastatic STS, or STS where broad molecular diagnostics were deemed necessary. Actionable targets were defined as genomic alterations identified by WGS for which specific systemic therapy was indicated in routine care or clinical trials available at time of the WGS analysis. WGS was carried out on 161 STS patients. The most common histological subtypes were leiomyosarcoma (22%), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma/sarcoma not otherwise specified (17%) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (14%). The majority of WGS analyses were requested at the time of recurrence or metastasis (41%), At least one actionable target was found by WGS in 74 (46%) of patients. Actionable targets were more frequently seen for complex genome sarcomas compared with simple genome sarcomas (50% versus 28%). Eventually, 23 patients (14%) received matched experimental therapy based on their WGS results. Non-availability of WGS directed treatment or lack of clinical necessity for systemic therapy (n = 17) and rapid disease progression causing poor performance score (n = 10) were the main reasons to not start WGS-informed therapy. WGS identified actionable targets in 46% of STS cases, leading to WGS-informed therapy in 14% of patients. Improving the timing of the WGS request and a more appropriate patient selection upfront could increase this relatively low percentage. Complex genome sarcomas seem to be the STS group for which WGS is most likely to add value by opening the way to tumor-agnostic therapies.

[PMID: 40439109] Pancreatic cancer's aberrant lipid metabolism fuels cell growth, invasion, and metastasis, yet its impact on immune surveillance and immunotherapy is unclear. This study investigated how sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1)-driven lipid metabolism affects the tumor microenvironment (TME) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Clinical significance of SREBP1 was assessed in a PDAC cohort from China and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. The in vitro mechanisms that SREBP1 regulated programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) were investigated using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, Western blotting, luciferase assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. In vivo studies using PDAC-bearing mice, humanized patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models, and autochthonous model of mutation (GEMM-KTC) evaluated the efficacy and mechanisms of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) antibodies and lipid inhibitors. Patients responding to anti-PD-1 therapy exhibited lower serum lipid levels than non-responders. Targeting SREBP1 disrupted lipid metabolism, decelerated tumor growth, and boosted the efficacy of immunotherapy for PDAC. Mechanistically, SREBP1 directly bound the PD-L1 promoter, suppressing its transcription. Meanwhile, PCSK9, a direct transcriptional target of SREBP1, modulated PD-L1 levels via lysosomal degradation. Consequently, the combination of PCSK9-neutralizing antibodies with PD-1 monotherapy showed a robust antitumor effect in both humanized PDX and GEMM-KTC models. The SREBP1-PCSK9 axis-mediated lipid metabolism is crucial for triggering immune evasion and resistance to anti-PD-1. Targeting the SREBP1-PCSK9 axis could potentially reverse PDAC's resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy.",10

In this study, we show that deficiency of type I IFN signaling reduces seizure severity in a kainic acid-induced mouse model. Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited significantly lower seizure scores at multiple time points (e.g., U = 88.5, p = 0.0078 at 110 min), along with decreased neuronal excitability and microglial activation in these mice in response to kainic acid stimulation. Conversely, intracerebroventricular injection of IFN-β exacerbated kainic acid-induced seizure severity. In vitro calcium imaging demonstrated that IFN-β treatment enhanced neuronal excitability, although no significant difference in basal neuronal excitability were observed between wild-type and Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> neurons. Additionally, Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed reduced activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in the brain following kainic acid administration-a pathway known to contribute to epileptogenesis. Consistent with this finding, IFN-β treatment increased mTOR activation, as indicated by S6 phosphorylation in in vitro mixed glial cultures. Taken together, these findings highlight a critical role of type I IFN signaling in seizure progression, potentially via mTOR modulation, and suggest that targeting type I IFNs may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for epilepsy.

[PMID: 40708193] Neuroinflammation, predominantly associated with glial activation and the release of various inflammatory mediators, is a vital hallmark of the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Numerous studies have indicated that identifying novel factors that diminish neuroinflammatory processes may be important for developing effective therapeutic strategies to prevent neuropathological processes and epileptogenic progression. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) is a highly selective calcium ion channel belonging to the TRPV family. TRPV5 expression has been identified in diverse regions of the brain; however, it remains unknown how TRPV5 is implicated in the pathophysiological features of neurological diseases, including epilepsy. Herein, we show that TRPV5 expression is upregulated in the hippocampus of a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PCSE) model, predominantly in activated microglia. Pharmacological inhibition of TRPV5 using econazole attenuated microglial activation, as indicated by the shift of LPS-stimulated primary hippocampal microglia to a resting state. This inhibition suppressed AKT/NF-κB signaling, reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activity, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production. Additionally, TRPV5 inhibition reduced hippocampal microglial activation and neuroinflammation following PCSE. These findings suggest that TRPV5 contributes to the regulation of microglial activation, resulting in the suppression of microglia-derived neuroinflammation during the sub-acute phase of epilepsy. In conclusion, the present study suggests that targeting TRPV5 may offer a novel therapeutic approach to managing the neuroinflammatory processes during epileptogenic progression.

[PMID: 39826185] Traumatic brain injury is a significant risk factor for the development of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), posing a major clinical challenge. This review discusses the critical role of GABAergic interneurons and reactive astrogliosis in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic epilepsy, integrating findings from our research group within the traumatic brain injury context with recent literature to highlight the impact of excitation-inhibition imbalance. We analyzed alterations in interneuron populations, specifically subtypes expressing the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, calretinin, and calbindin, and their association with an increased risk of epileptogenesis after TBI. Furthermore, we detail the role of reactive astrogliosis, elucidating how dysregulated astrocytic functions, including impaired glutamate homeostasis and aberrant calcium signaling, contribute to an environment conducive to seizure activity. Increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and crystallin alpha-B in reactive astrocytes identified in contused human tissue suggests their involvement in exacerbating epileptogenic circuits. Our findings emphasize the intricate interactions between GABAergic interneurons and astrocytes, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying post-traumatic epilepsy. By bridging our group's data with existing evidence, this review establishes a foundation for future studies aimed at validating systemic biomarkers and developing targeted therapies to prevent or mitigate epilepsy progression following TBI. These insights are essential for addressing the complexities of drug-resistant epilepsy in affected patients.

[PMID: 39804104] Staining brain slices with acetoxymethyl ester (AM) Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes is a straightforward procedure to load multiple cells, and Fluo-4 is a commonly used high-affinity indicator due to its very large dynamic range. It has been shown that this dye preferentially stains glial cells, providing slow and large Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, but it is questionable whether and at which temporal resolution it can also report Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from neuronal cells. Here, by electrically stimulating mouse hippocampal slices, we resolved fast neuronal signals corresponding to 1%-3% maximal fluorescence changes. Specifically, by recording Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence at 2000 frames/s from multiple sites both in the CA3 and in the CA1 regions, we observed that the signal measured near the stimulating electrode, positioned on the mossy fibre pathway, was not blocked by perfusion with 10 μM NBQX and 50 μM AP5, preventing excitatory synaptic transmission. In contrast, this signal was fully blocked by additional perfusion with 1 μM tetrodotoxin, inhibiting voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and neuronal action potentials. We also present recordings obtained in the presence of 10 μM of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist bicuculline, or of 50 μM of the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel inhibitor 4-aminopyridine, exhibiting a wide propagation of the signal from CA3 to CA1 regions under conditions that mimic epileptic seizures. Altogether, while Fluo-4 AM remains a preferable indicator for reporting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from astrocytes at slow temporal resolution, we demonstrated that it can be also utilised for analysing fast neuronal network activity elicited by electrical stimulation in brain slices.

[PMID: 39486416] The brain's ability to rapidly transition between sleep, quiet wakefulness, and states of high vigilance is remarkable. Cerebral norepinephrine (NE) plays a key role in promoting wakefulness, but how does the brain avoid neuronal hyperexcitability upon arousal? Here, we show that NE exposure results in the generation of free fatty acids (FFAs) within the plasma membrane from both astrocytes and neurons. In turn, FFAs dampen excitability by differentially modulating the activity of astrocytic and neuronal Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, ATPase. Direct application of FFA to the occipital cortex in awake, behaving mice dampened visual-evoked potentials (VEPs). Conversely, blocking FFA production via local application of a lipase inhibitor heightened VEP and triggered seizure-like activity. These results suggest that FFA release is a crucial step in NE signaling that safeguards against hyperexcitability. Targeting lipid-signaling pathways may offer a novel therapeutic approach for seizure prevention.

[PMID: 39213710] Seizures induce hippocampal subregion dependent enhancements in microglia/macrophage phagocytosis and cytokine release that may contribute to the development of epilepsy. As a model of hyperactive mTOR induced epilepsy, neuronal subset specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (NS-Pten) knockout (KO) mice exhibit hyperactive mTOR signaling in the hippocampus, seizures that progress with age, and enhanced hippocampal microglia/macrophage activation. However, it is unknown where microglia/macrophages are most active within the hippocampus of NS-Pten KO mice. We quantified the density of IBA1 positive microglia/macrophages in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus of NS-Pten KO and wildtype (WT) male and female mice at 4, 10, and 15 weeks of age. NS-Pten KO mice exhibited an overall increase in the number of IBA1 positive microglia/macrophages in each subregion and in the entire hippocampus. After accounting for differences in size, the whole hippocampus of NS-Pten KO mice still exhibited an increased density of IBA1 positive microglia/macrophages. Subregion analyses showed that this increase was restricted to the dentate gyrus of both male and female NS-Pten KO mice and to the CA1 of male NS-Pten KO mice. These data suggest enhanced microglia/macrophage activity may occur in the NS-Pten KO mice in a hippocampal subregion and sex-dependent manner. Future work should seek to determine whether these region-specific increases in microgliosis play a role in the progression of epilepsy in this model.

[PMID: 38749701] The voltage-gated calcium channel subunit α2δ-2 controls calcium-dependent signaling in neurons, and loss of this subunit causes epilepsy in both mice and humans. To determine whether mice without α2δ-2 demonstrate hippocampal activation or histopathological changes associated with seizure activity, we measured expression of the activity-dependent gene c<i>-fos</i> and various histopathological correlates of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in hippocampal tissue from wild-type (WT) and α2δ-2 knock-out (<i>CACNA2D2</i> KO) mice using immunohistochemical staining and confocal microscopy. Both genotypes demonstrated similarly sparse c-<i>fos</i> and <i>ΔFosB</i> expressions within the hippocampal dentate granule cell layer (GCL) at baseline, consistent with no difference in basal activity of granule cells between genotypes. Surprisingly, when mice were assayed 1 h after handling-associated convulsions, KO mice had fewer c-<i>fos</i>-positive cells but dramatically increased <i>ΔFosB</i> expression in the dentate gyrus compared with WT mice. After administration of a subthreshold pentylenetetrazol dose, however, KO mice dentate had significantly more c-<i>fos</i> expression compared with WT mice. Other histopathological markers of TLE in these mice, including markers of neurogenesis, glial activation, and mossy fiber sprouting, were similar between WT and KO mice, apart from a small but statistically significant increase in hilar mossy cell density, opposite to what is typically found in mice with TLE. This suggests that the differences in seizure-associated dentate gyrus function in the absence of α2δ-2 protein are likely due to altered functional properties of the network without associated structural changes in the hippocampus at the typical age of seizure onset.

[PMID: 38614103] Microglial calcium signaling is rare in a baseline state but strongly engaged during early epilepsy development. The mechanism(s) governing microglial calcium signaling are not known. By developing an in vivo uridine diphosphate (UDP) fluorescent sensor, GRAB<sub>UDP1.0</sub>, we discovered that UDP release is a conserved response to seizures and excitotoxicity across brain regions. UDP can signal through the microglial-enriched P2Y<sub>6</sub> receptor to increase calcium activity during epileptogenesis. P2Y<sub>6</sub> calcium activity is associated with lysosome biogenesis and enhanced production of NF-κB-related cytokines. In the hippocampus, knockout of the P2Y<sub>6</sub> receptor prevents microglia from fully engulfing neurons. Attenuating microglial calcium signaling through calcium extruder (""CalEx"") expression recapitulates multiple features of P2Y<sub>6</sub> knockout, including reduced lysosome biogenesis and phagocytic interactions. Ultimately, P2Y<sub>6</sub> knockout mice retain more CA3 neurons and better cognitive task performance during epileptogenesis. Our results demonstrate that P2Y<sub>6</sub> signaling impacts multiple aspects of myeloid cell immune function during epileptogenesis.

[PMID: 38418708] Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in various organs, including the brain, and is often accompanied by epilepsy, neurodevelopmental comorbidities including intellectual disability and autism. A key hallmark of TSC is the hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which induces alterations in cortical development and metabolic processes in astrocytes, among other cellular functions. These changes could modulate seizure susceptibility, contributing to the progression of epilepsy and its associated comorbidities. Epilepsy is characterized by dysregulation of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channels and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. These factors contribute to hyperexcitability, disrupted synaptogenesis, and altered synchronization of neuronal networks, all of which contribute to seizure activity. This study investigates the intricate interplay between altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, mTOR pathway dysregulation, and cellular metabolism in astrocytes. The transcriptional profile of TSC patients revealed significant alterations in pathways associated with cellular respiration, ER and mitochondria, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation. TSC astrocytes exhibited lack of responsiveness to various stimuli, compromised oxygen consumption rate and reserve respiratory capacity underscoring their reduced capacity to react to environmental changes or cellular stress. Furthermore, our study revealed significant reduction of store operated calcium entry (SOCE) along with strong decrease of basal mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in TSC astrocytes. In addition, we observed alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential, characterized by increased depolarization in TSC astrocytes. Lastly, we provide initial evidence of structural abnormalities in mitochondria within TSC patient-derived astrocytes, suggesting a potential link between disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings underscore the complexity of the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, mitochondria dynamics, apoptosis, and mTOR hyperactivation. Further exploration is required to shed light on the pathophysiology of TSC and on TSC associated neuropsychiatric disorders offering further potential avenues for therapeutic development.

[PMID: 37880726] The astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibit morphological and functional diversity in brain region-specific pattern. Functional alterations of reactive astrocytes are commonly present in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) cases, meanwhile the neuroinflammation mediated by reactive astrocytes may advance the development of hippocampal epilepsy in animal models. Nuclear factor I-A (NFIA) may regulate astrocyte diversity in the adult brain. However, whether NFIA endows the astrocytes with regional specificity to be involved in epileptogenesis remains elusive. Here, we utilize an interference RNA targeting NFIA to explore the characteristics of NFIA expression and its role in astrocyte reactivity in a 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced seizure model in vivo and in vitro. Combined with the employment of a HA-tagged plasmid overexpressing NFIA, we further investigate the precise mechanisms how NIFA facilitates epileptogenesis. 4-AP-induced NFIA upregulation in hippocampal region is astrocyte-specific, and primarily promotes detrimental actions of reactive astrocyte. In line with this phenomenon, both NFIA and vanilloid transient receptor potential 4 (TRPV4) are upregulated in hippocampal astrocytes in human samples from the TLE surgical patients and mouse samples with intraperitoneal 4-AP. NFIA directly regulates mouse astrocytic TRPV4 expression while the quantity and the functional activity of TRPV4 are required for 4-AP-induced astrocyte reactivity and release of proinflammatory cytokines in the charge of NFIA upregulation. NFIA deficiency efficiently inhibits 4-AP-induced TRPV4 upregulation, weakens astrocytic calcium activity and specific astrocyte reactivity, thereby mitigating aberrant neuronal discharges and neuronal damage, and suppressing epileptic seizure. Our results uncover the critical role of NFIA in astrocyte reactivity and illustrate how epileptogenic brain injury initiates cell-specific signaling pathway to dictate the astrocyte responses.",10
Gpr124 suppresses BBB breakdown in mouse models of ischemic stroke.,GPR124 AND Blood-Brain Barrier AND ischemic stroke AND mouse models,"28288111,41187332,41187216,41187206,41187191,41187159,41187108,41187107,41187102,41187072","[PMID: 28288111] Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise is central to the etiology of diverse central nervous system (CNS) disorders, endothelial receptor proteins that control BBB function are poorly defined. The endothelial G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr124 has been reported to be required for normal forebrain angiogenesis and BBB function in mouse embryos, but the role of this receptor in adult animals is unknown. Here Gpr124 conditional knockout (CKO) in the endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity, but resulted in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic stroke and glioblastoma, accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Constitutive activation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice, with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction, pericyte coverage and extracellular-matrix deficits. We thus identify Gpr124 as an endothelial GPCR specifically required for endothelial Wnt signaling and BBB integrity under pathological conditions in adult mice. This finding implicates Gpr124 as a potential therapeutic target for human CNS disorders characterized by BBB disruption.

[PMID: 41187332] The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) compared with anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and its impact on the primary prevention of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Patients with non-valvular AF and high thromboembolic risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc > 2 points) were included. LAAO was compared against the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 11, 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-E, while statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.4.1. A total of 10 studies with 5,779 patients were analyzed (2,916 with LAAO and 2,863 with anticoagulation). LAAO reduced, though without statistical significance, the incidence of ischemic stroke (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09). However, it showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the overall anticoagulant group (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.80; p = 0.0004). LAAO emerges as a viable strategy to reduce mortality in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, particularly when long-term anticoagulation is not feasible. Its superiority over DOACs and comparable profile to VKAs, along with the absence of periodic INR monitoring and relevant drug interactions, make it an option that may optimize adherence and quality of life.

[PMID: 41187216] Many taxa have independently evolved genetic sex determination where a single gene located on a sex chromosome controls gonadal differentiation. The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex-reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the ""Four Core Genotypes"" model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.

[PMID: 41187206] Fast skeletal muscle fibers from zebrafish share a number of functional properties with mammalian twitch muscle fibers, making this vertebrate a precious model to investigate the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders. We previously reported that action potentials (APs) from zebrafish fast fibers exhibit low amplitude and require unusually strong negative resting membrane voltage levels to be elicited. In this study, using voltage-clamp and current-clamp techniques, we explored the properties of voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV) responsible for initiation and propagation of AP in isolated adult zebrafish fast skeletal muscle fibers and compared them to mouse fast-twitch muscle fibers using the same experimental conditions. We found that kinetics of activation and inactivation of NaV were faster in zebrafish fibers and, overall, that the voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted by 25 mV toward negative voltages as compared to mouse fibers, yielding a mean half-inactivation potential of -90 mV. In agreement with these findings, recording of APs at various resting membrane potentials indicated that APs vanished for resting membrane potentials less negative than -80 mV in zebrafish, whereas APs could still be elicited from resting membrane potentials as low as -60 mV in mice. In addition, Ca2+ transients induced by field stimulation were insensitive to Na+ current blockade in zebrafish but not in mouse fibers. Fluorescence labeling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors showed that zebrafish fast fibers were multi-innervated with a mean distance between extra-synaptic sarcolemma and motor endplates of 14 µm, expected to lead to negligible attenuation of depolarization propagated from endplates. Finally, knock out of the two genes encoding pore-forming NaV subunits in zebrafish muscles did not induce any change in locomotion and escape behavior of the animals. Taken together, these data question the role of NaV and the occurrence of APs in zebrafish fast muscle.

[PMID: 41187191] Severe viral and bacterial pneumonia are among the most common causes of death worldwide. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1)'s on methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)-induced severe pneumonia following cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. A young mouse model of severe pneumonia was established using Staphylococcus aureus and CMV. LTBP1 overexpression was induced, and pathological changes in lung tissue were assessed through H&E staining. Serum levels of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and interleukin (IL)-1β, were measured using ELISA. Bacterial load in the lungs was quantified, and protein expression levels of LTBP1, TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad3, and p-Smad3 in lung tissue were analyzed using Western blot. The LTBP1 expression was reduced in the young mouse model of severe pneumonia induced by Staphylococcus aureus after cytomegalovirus reactivation. Overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited lung damage, reduced serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and decreased bacterial load in the lungs. Additionally, overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. LTBP1 efficiently reduces severe pneumonia by activating the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating this condition.

[PMID: 41187159] Adolescent opioid use in the United States commands attention: millions of twelve- to nineteen-year-olds are exposed to opioids each year by prescription and misuse. Recent findings show that opioids bind not only to canonical opioid receptors but also interact with receptors on immune cells within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The potential for early life opioid exposure to give rise to long-term changes in the neuroimmune system is not fully understood, particularly given the adolescent brain's high susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that adolescent opioid use potentiates physiological and behavioral responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness later in life. To achieve this, we treated adolescent (postnatal day 35-42) male and female C57/BL6 mice with saline or bi-daily escalating doses of morphine for 5 days to model opioid dependence and, in adulthood (postnatal day 60-67), administered saline or a low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) to promote an immune response. Body weight, body surface temperature, and locomotor activity were recorded up to 48 hours after LPS administration. Mice were also tested in the forced swim test 52 hours after LPS administration to assess depressive-like behavior. In contrast to our hypotheses, we found that adolescent morphine exposure had no additive effect on low-dose LPS-induced sickness measures when assessed in adulthood. These data suggest that adolescent opioid exposure may have minimal effects on future immune challenges, although further research is needed to confirm this.

[PMID: 41187108] Sensory processing is dynamically modulated by an animal's behavior and internal states. Growing evidence suggests that such modulation starts from early stages, already at the retina, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Combining pharmacological and chemogenetic tools with single-unit extracellular recordings in awake head-fixed mice, here we identified that the visual responses of retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus were both made weaker and slower by histaminergic projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus. The observed changes in the visual responses were, however, not directly linked with histaminergic modulation of pupil dynamics or locomotion behavior. Instead, our computational modeling analysis suggests that the temporal response modulations arise from changes in the intrinsic properties of the circuit, such as gain modulation via the histamine H1 receptors in the retina. Facilitation of visual processing at low histamine levels may offer an ethological advantage, enabling animals to respond rapidly to visual threats during periods of reduced activity.

[PMID: 41187107] Emerging clinical evidence suggests a link between environmental noise and the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNcDA neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNcDA neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41187102] This study aimed to evaluate the long-term risk of stroke following dementia diagnosis and compare stroke risk across dementia subtypes using nationwide cohort data. We performed a retrospective cohort study using Korean National Health Insurance Service data (2002-2013). Patients with newly diagnosed dementia (n = 2,820) were matched 1:10 with controls (n = 28,200) by age, sex, and health screening year. Stroke incidence was evaluated over up to 10 years of follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated using Cox regression. During a mean follow-up of 2.49 years (median, 1.99; standard deviation, 2.07; IQR, 2.66), dementia was significantly associated with increased stroke risk (aHR, 3.19; 95% CI, 2.84-3.57). The highest risk was observed in patients with vascular dementia (VaD; aHR, 3.58), followed by Alzheimer's disease (AD; 2.73) and other dementias (2.61). IS was more common than HS across all subtypes. The relative risk was greater in individuals aged <60 years and in males with AD or other dementias, whereas sex differences were not evident in VaD. Dementia, especially VaD, is a strong risk factor for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. These findings support the need for dementia subtype-specific cerebrovascular risk assessment and long-term prevention strategies.

[PMID: 41187072] Inflammation is a vital response to injury or infection but can lead to diseases if chronic. Natural remedies like plant extracts present potential alternatives to synthetic drugs, offering efficacy with fewer side effects. This study explores the anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties of the aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera (AEMO) using various animal models. AEMO was evaluated in xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, wound healing, and cotton pellet granuloma models. In the carrageenan model, AEMO demonstrated significant dose-dependent reductions in paw edema (P < .001), with the 350 mg/kg dose achieving 94.4% inhibition, comparable to diclofenac. Similarly, in the cotton pellet model, AEMO significantly reduced granuloma weight at higher doses. The xylene model confirmed AEMO's efficacy, with doses of 175 mg/kg and 350 mg/kg showing reductions in ear edema comparable to diclofenac. In the wound healing model, AEMO accelerated wound closure in a dose-dependent manner, with the 60% AEMO group achieving complete healing by Day 10. Biochemical and hematological analyses showed reductions in inflammatory markers such as ALP, C-reactive protein, and WBC, supporting the anti-inflammatory potential of AEMO. These findings suggest that AEMO exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties, making it a promising natural alternative to conventional treatments like diclofenac. Further research is warranted to explore its potential clinical applications.",10

After fracturing, the well-soaking is commonly employed to control fracturing fluid flowback and enhance oil recovery, so that the oil in the reservoir matrix is replaced by fracturing fluid, which can improve the crude oil recovery and reduce the flowback of the fracturing fluid. In this paper, the gel breaking fluid of slick water fracturing fluid, guanidine gum fracturing fluid and cross-linked guanidine gum fracturing fluid are used as displacement working fluids to study the effect of gel breaking fluid on oil displacement in tight sandstone reservoirs. The results show that it is not the smaller the pore radius that the higher the displacement efficiency, but the oil displacement efficiency is higher for the equilibrium of capillary force and percolation resistance in a certain radius of pore throat. For tight sandstone reservoir, the oil displacement efficiency of small pore, middle pore and large pore is higher, the oil displacement efficiency of micro-pore is lower, and the oil in pore throat with radius less than 0.01 μm is difficult to be replaced. The lower the interfacial tension is, the lower the viscosity is, and the higher the oil displacement efficiency is. For tight sandstone reservoir, the displacement efficiency of crude oil can reach 13.11% -33.31%, the displacement of crude oil in the early stage is mainly displaced out of the middle and small pores, and then replaced out of the large pores and micro-pores of crude oil.

[PMID: 41186319] In this article, we examine the stability of self-rewetting films (SRF) flowing along a soft vertical cylinder where the flow is driven by the combined action of gravity and thermocapillarity. A long-wave model is formulated to capture the evolution of the liquid layer thickness and the substrate deformation where the film flow interacts with the soft structure through gravity, thermocapillary forces, and the elasticity of the soft fibre with the Winkler-based framework. Using the model, we explore the impact of quadratic thermocapillarity of SRF films including elasticity of the soft fibre and film thickness on the temporal stability. The conventional thermocapillarity (when <i>T</i><sub>i</sub> < <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>) along with elasticity of soft fibre augments the instability whereas the anomalous thermocapillarity (when <i>T</i><sub>i</sub> > <i>T</i><sub>m</sub>) suppresses the instability with <i>T</i><sub>i</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> denoting the interface temperature and minimum surface tension temperature respectively. The time-dependent computations of the coupled nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) of the interface reveal soft-layer deformation which may also lead to localized bulging in the interface due to conventional thermocapillarity and elasticity of the soft fibre. The results of numerical simulations are consistent with our linear theory.

[PMID: 41185995] Ang II (angiotensin II) causes hypertension and vascular inflammation both directly and indirectly via cytokines, including TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α). In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), Ang II and TNFα activate Nox1 (NADPH oxidase 1) to produce superoxide. TNFα receptors associate with Nox1 and LRRC8A (leucine-rich repeat containing 8A) anion channels to modulate inflammation and contractility in a RhoA-dependent manner. VSMC-specific LRRC8A knockout mesenteric arteries are protected from TNFα-induced injury, and vasodilation is preserved. We hypothesized that LRRC8A knockout would preserve vascular function and decrease blood pressure (BP) in Ang II-infused mice. Wild-type and knockout mice received Ang II infusions for 14 days. BP was measured by radiotelemetry, and aortic and mesenteric artery function was measured by wire myography. VSMCs were isolated from male wild-type and knockout mice. Systolic BP was not different, but knockout mice had more BP dipping during inactive periods at baseline, and dipping was preserved after Ang II. The function of knockout aortic and mesenteric vessels was less impaired by Ang II, as reflected by less augmented contraction to norepinephrine and serotonin and preserved relaxation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Western blotting revealed increased soluble guanylate cyclase alpha and reduced CPI-17 in hypertensive knockout aortae. Consistent with lower Rho kinase activity, phosphorylation of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) and cofilin was reduced in knockout VSMCs. Ang II caused less proliferation (lower PCNA [proliferating cell nuclear antigen]) and less induction of senescence in knockout vessels. LRRC8A anion channels support VSMC inflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction, which impairs BP dipping in hypertension.

[PMID: 41184023] Blowing nanoparticle-doped polymer colloidal suspension with high-speed airflow is a commonly used method for fabricating functional fibers. However, theoretical models capable of accurately describing the fiber formation process remain limited. This is primarily due to the tendency of polymer jets to undergo deformation and instability under strong airflow, which becomes more pronounced when nanoparticles are introduced. To address this issue, a dynamic rheological model was developed in this study to predict the fiber formation behavior of nanoparticle-doped polymer colloidal suspension under high-speed airflow. The model incorporates multiphysical mechanisms (airflow shear force, surface tension, and viscoelasticity) and considers the indirect influence of nanoparticles on the flow evolution. The numerical simulations accurately predicted the evolution of the fiber diameter (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.87-0.98) and lateral oscillation amplitude (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.70-0.88) under various processing conditions, showing good agreement with the experimental measurements. In addition, the real-time observation of jet dynamics was performed using dual-plane high-speed imaging. The experimental results indicated that an appropriate number of nanoparticles could enhance the viscoelasticity of the solution, suppress initial disturbances, and improve fiber stability. However, for the higher nanoparticle concentration, the shear thinning efficiency decreased, resulting in an increase in the fiber diameter and a lateral oscillation amplitude. In contrast, increasing the gas pressure strengthened the shear forces and promoted fiber thinning; however, higher pressure gradually transformed the airflow field into a nonstationary state, amplified the lateral oscillations, and eventually led to a nonlinear jet breakup. These findings provide new insights into the stability and process control of nanoparticle-doped fibers.

[PMID: 41183398] Capillary forces, arising from surface tension and wetting interactions, play a crucial role in nanoscale material behavior, particularly during solvent evaporation in nanowire-based systems. In this study, capillary-induced deformation in silver nanowires is analysed through a simplified two-step finite element model using ANSYS Static. The effects of these forces during the film formation and moisture treatment stages are investigated for silver nanowires with diameters of 25 nm, 40 nm, and 100 nm. Results show that smaller-diameter nanowires experience significantly higher capillary pressures, leading to greater plastic deformation despite their greater mechanical strength. In contrast, larger wires exhibit lower effective pressure due to reduced capillary efficiency, although the total capillary force is higher. The model contact angle after the film formation step allows for accurate estimation of capillary pressure during the moisture treatment step, enabling the calculation of final strain and stress distributions. Nanometre gaps between wires, which influence cold welding and contact resistance, are also quantitatively analysed.

[PMID: 41181939] Physical forces play a crucial role in microbial behavior. In free-swimming bacteria, the hydrodynamics of flagellar propulsion govern motility. On surfaces, physical interactions are equally important though often complex and easily overlooked. Surface migration occurs in many flagellated bacteria and has been linked to diverse mechanisms, such as flagellar propulsion, surface tension, osmolyte production, or combinations thereof. However, the relative importance of these physical effects remains unclear. Here, we describe ""swashing,"" a form of surface movement in which bacteria migrate without active propulsion. Mutants of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> lacking flagellar filaments and motility proteins exhibit surface migration comparable to wild-type strains. Swashing is supported by fermentable sugars and inhibited by surfactants. We propose a model in which fermentation at the colony edge creates an osmotic gradient that draws water from the agar, generating fluid flows that propel the colony outward. Overall, our findings show that flagellar propulsion is dispensable for surface migration; instead, fermentation-driven fluid flows may be sufficient to enable bacterial spreading.IMPORTANCEBacteria move on surfaces using a variety of mechanisms, with important implications for their growth and survival in both the clinical setting (such as on the surface of medical devices) and the wild. Surface motility in Gram negative model species <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>E. coli</i> has been extensively studied and is believed to depend on flagellar propulsion. Here, we show surface expansion in these species even in the absence of propulsion by the flagella. We suggest that this flagella-independent movement is tied to fermentation and resulting osmotic flow: As cells ferment sugars, they create local osmolarity gradients, which generate a wave of fluid that drives expansion.

[PMID: 41181726] This article introduces Myopraktikk (NO), a Norwegian-developed manual treatment method, where we clinically observe by palpation and visual inspection immediate local and remote responses that form the basis for a new hypothesis uniting intrafasciomembranal fluid pressure (IFMFP), Myopraktikk treatment chains, and the principle of biotensegrity in a single framework. Here, IFMFP refers to fluid pressure within fascial compartments, treatment chains describe functional pathways of force and tension that appear to respond collectively to local input, and biotensegrity denotes mechanical balance in an interconnected network. Muscle pain and myalgias are among the most common causes of pain and functional impairment, yet current models remain fragmented and leave major gaps. Why does nonspecific pain and stiffness arise without structural findings? Why do muscles feel ""tight"" at rest, and why do some tensions resolve quickly while others persist? What are muscle knots, trigger points (TrP), and fascial restrictions in regional pain conditions, and how might they connect to fibromyalgia (FM), overtraining syndrome (OTS), myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or even everyday complaints such as morning stiffness and weather-related pain? The IFMFP model postulates fluid accumulation and pressure rise within fascial spaces surrounding muscle fibers, bundles, and whole muscles, driven by overuse and impaired drainage, and conceptually comparable to intramuscular compartment pressure. This pressure alone might shorten and thicken tissue, and induce venous stasis, hypoxia, pH reduction, hyaluronan (HA) modification, and altered membrane permeability. Unlike traditional theories that see HA changes as causal, the IFMFP model proposes the reverse: pressure drives HA alterations and densification, enabling chronic dysfunction. A key clinical observation is that, by palpation and visual inspection, knots, TrP, tensions, and fascial cords are often felt to diminish during treatment, both locally and remotely, with patients and practitioners reporting perceived immediate changes in asymmetry, tonus, and stiffness. These findings suggest such structures are not static lesions but dynamic fluid pockets of increased IFMFP, dissolving as pressure is released. Based on clinical observations, the Myopraktikk treatment chains reveal patterns of movement, force, and tension, where local interventions may influence the entire chain through systemic equalization, in line with biotensegrity. By integrating biomechanical, physiological, and psychosocial factors, IFMFP offers a unifying mechanism that may link diverse myalgias within an expanded framework of myofascial pain syndrome. Myopraktikk therefore challenges established assumptions both as a treatment method and as a conceptual framework, where immediate, systemic, and reversible changes in myofascial tension, amplified by the physical expression of stress and thought, provide a fresh understanding of myalgias.

[PMID: 41181147] Skin protects the body from external threats by constituting an epithelial-immune microenvironment. Sulfotransferase family 2B member 1 (SULT2B1) converts cholesterol to cholesterol sulfate (CS). We previously reported that CS acts as an endogenous dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2)-inhibitory metabolite suppressing immune cell migration and activation by inhibiting DOCK2-mediated Rac activation. Despite being located in the epidermis, pathophysiological roles of CS in cutaneous inflammation remain unknown. We evaluated the <i>Sult2b1</i>-producing cells in the dorsal skin of wild-type mice and compared the degree of cutaneous inflammation between wild-type and <i>Sult2b1</i> knockout mice using a psoriatic dermatitis model induced by topical imiquimod (IMQ). We also examined <i>SULT2B1</i> gene expression levels in human epidermal keratinocytes to assess the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. <i>Sult2b1</i> expression levels and CS production gradually increased in the skin of psoriatic dermatitis model mice. IMQ-induced dermatitis and neutrophil recruitment were exacerbated in the <i>Sult2b1</i> knockout mice with a complete loss of CS. Furthermore, genetic deletion of <i>Dock2</i> or intravenous administration of neutrophil-depleting antibodies alleviated IMQ-induced dermatitis in <i>Sult2b1</i> knockout mice. Notably, CS was more abundant in the skin samples of patients with psoriasis than in the healthy control samples. Primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes exhibited significantly elevated <i>SULT2B1</i> levels after Th1 cytokine treatment. These findings suggest that increased SULT2B1 levels in the skin under psoriatic conditions may be involved in a negative feedback mechanism that helps to limit excessive skin inflammation, thereby potentially contributing to the maintenance of epithelial-immune microenvironment homeostasis. Overall, our results raise the possibility that SULT2B1 plays an important role in cutaneous inflammation and could serve as a useful indicator or potential target in psoriasis.

[PMID: 41181068] The cultural policies of Mainland China have been subject to fascinating changes in the last forty years, influenced by politics and ideology on the one hand, and market forces on the other. The article provides a preliminary outline of the main traits of the system, analysed from the perspective of contemporary cultural policies theory and international practice. The authors examine how the cultural sector of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is organized and financed, including its governance, funding, copyright, basic cultural providers and consumers. The methodological approach used adopts the analytical framework of the Compendium of Cultural Policies & Trends, and includes analyses of statistical data, primary and secondary sources. Data and source information show that cultural policies of the PRC are a function of central-level political policy-making of the party-state. Cultural activity at all levels is subject to strong political control. At the same time, there is visible tension between central-level general policy guidelines and local level implementation, and between the mission of the state to ensure wide cultural participation, and the market economy incentivization of public cultural organizations. The authors conclude that the sector exhibits a dual characteristics, with market-insulated public services on the one side, and the market economy Cultural and Creative Sectors (CCS) on the other, where state-owned enterprises compete for services, customers, and profits with private entities. Faced with numerous challenges and new developments, the sector also witnesses dynamic changes of its legal environment.

[PMID: 41179226] This paper provides the research progress on emulsification, viscosity, phase inversion characteristics, and prediction methods of crude oil-water mixed systems. In the development of onshore and offshore oilfields, oil and water are often transported through pipelines in a mixed state, and the shear strength within the pipelines promotes the formation of emulsions. Such emulsions significantly increase the effective viscosity of the mixture, thereby altering the flow characteristics and pressure drop of the pipelines. In-depth studies have revealed that the properties of this system are determined by the combined action of internal and external factors. Among the internal factors, the physical properties of crude oil and natural surface-active substances (such as asphaltenes) are core elements. They directly affect the stability of emulsions by influencing the interfacial tension, interfacial film strength, solid particle distribution, and electric double-layer status. External factors, represented by shear force, water content, and temperature, continuously regulate the degree of emulsification and the viscosity characteristics of the mixture. It is worth noting that the phase inversion point of crude oil emulsions, as a key parameter, holds significant guiding significance for oilfield production and pipeline oil-water mixed transportation processes. Based on this, future research should focus on three aspects: exploring the influence of aqueous phase properties on emulsification characteristics, establishing a unified viscosity prediction model that can integrate stable and unstable systems, and introducing big data technology to enhance the universality and applicability of research results. These efforts will provide strong support for optimizing process calculations in oilfield development and promote the in-depth integration of theoretical research and engineering practice.",10
H.pylori-mediated gastric cancer occurs due to the accumulation of mutations in host epithelial cells.,H. pylori AND gastric cancer AND epithelial cell mutations AND genetic mutations,"40789449,39534413,38837872,38231221,37490912,39129877,35750256,34942172,33989515,33918902","[PMID: 40789449] Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium known to cause persistent infections in humans. HtrA protease is one of the most important secreted virulence factors of this pathogen and is responsible for damaging intercellular junctions between the gastric epithelial cells. Although this protein is regarded as essential in H. pylori, very little is known about its function in the bacterial cell physiology. In this work, we attempted to expand the knowledge in this aspect. We found that deletion of the htrA gene caused significant alterations in the membrane proteome, including changes in the content of many outer membrane proteins. This translated into modifications in the cell surface properties, affecting the function of the outer membrane as a barrier in the mutant cells. Interestingly, maintaining the homeostasis of cellular envelope was dependent mainly on the chaperone activity; the role of proteolytic activity was far less important in this respect, considering the proteomic data and the surface properties of the bacteria. In vitro, HtrA degraded several H. pylori proteins, including proteins involved in virulence: oncogenic effector CagA, whose degradation products accumulated in H. pylori ΔhtrA cells, and the iron-regulated OM protein FrpB4. In conclusion, the results presented in this work underline the very important role of the HtrA protein in the maintenance of the cellular envelope proteostasis in H. pylori. Disrupted homeostasis in the absence of HtrA function can significantly impair the physiology of the whole H. pylori cell, which may affect its virulent properties.

[PMID: 39534413] <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) persistently colonizes the human gastric mucosa in more than 50% of the global population, leading to various gastroduodenal diseases ranging from chronic gastritis to gastric carcinoma. Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein, an important oncoprotein, has highly polymorphic Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala segments at the carboxyl terminus, which play crucial roles in pathogenesis. Our previous study revealed a significant association between amino acid deletions at positions 893 and 894 and gastric cancer. To investigate the impact of amino acid deletions at positions 893 and 894 on CagA function. We selected a representative HZT strain from a gastric cancer patient with amino acid deletions at positions 893 and 894. The <i>cagA</i> gene was amplified and mutated into <i>cagA</i>-NT and <i>cagA</i>-NE (sequence characteristics of strains from nongastric cancer patients), cloned and inserted into pAdtrack-CMV, and then transfected into AGS cells. The expression of <i>cagA</i> and its mutants was examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, cell elongation <i>via</i> cell counting, F-actin cytoskeleton visualization using fluorescence staining, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion <i>via</i> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results revealed that pAdtrack/<i>cagA</i> induced a more pronounced hummingbird phenotype than pAdtrack/<i>cagA</i>-NT and pAdtrack/<i>cagA</i>-NE (40.88 ± 3.10 <i>vs</i> 32.50 ± 3.17, <i>P</i> < 0.001 and 40.88 ± 3.10 <i>vs</i> 32.17 ± 3.00, <i>P</i> < 0.001) at 12 hours after transfection. At 24 hours, pAdtrack/<i>cagA-</i>NE induced significantly fewer hummingbird phenotypes than pAdtrack/<i>cagA</i> and pAdtrack/<i>cagA-</i>NT (46.02 ± 2.12 <i>vs</i> 53.90 ± 2.10, <i>P</i> < 0.001 and 46.02 ± 2.12 <i>vs</i> 51.15 ± 3.74, <i>P</i> < 0.001). The total amount of F-actin caused by pAdtrack/<i>cagA</i> was significantly lower than that caused by pAdtrack/<i>cagA-</i>NT and pAdtrack/<i>cagA-</i>NE (27.54 ± 17.37 <i>vs</i> 41.51 ± 11.90, <i>P</i> < 0.001 and 27.54 ± 17.37 <i>vs</i> 41.39 ± 14.22, <i>P</i> < 0.001) at 12 hours after transfection. Additionally, pAdtrack/<i>cagA</i> induced higher IL-8 secretion than pAdtrack/<i>cagA-</i>NT and pAdtrack/<i>cagA-</i>NE at different times after transfection. Amino acid deletions at positions 893 and 894 enhance CagA pathogenicity, which is crucial for revealing the pathogenic mechanism of CagA and identifying biomarkers of highly pathogenic <i>H. pylori</i>.

[PMID: 38837872] Reports of Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-naïve gastric neoplasm (HpNGN) cases have been rapidly increasing due to the recent increase in the Hp-naïve population in Japan. Most HpNGNs exhibit the gastric immunophenotype and a low malignant potential regardless of histological type. Especially, foveolar-type gastric adenoma (FGA) and intestinal-type gastric dysplasia (IGD) rarely progress to invasive carcinoma. FGA is a foveolar epithelial neoplasm that occurs in the fundic gland (oxyntic gland) mucosa and is classified as the flat type or raspberry type (FGA-RA). The flat type is a large, whitish flatly elevated lesion while FGA-RA is a small reddish polyp. Genomically, the flat type is characterized by APC and KRAS gene mutations and FGA-RA by a common single nucleotide variant in the KLF4 gene. This KLF4 single-nucleotide variant reportedly induces gastric foveolar epithelial tumorigenesis and activates both cell proliferation and apoptosis, leading to its slow-growing nature. IGD consists of an intestinalized epithelial dysplasia that develops in the pyloric gland mucosa, characterized as a superficial depressed lesion surrounded by raised mucosa showing a gastritis-like appearance. Immunohistochemically, it exhibits an intestinal or gastrointestinal phenotype and, frequently, p53 overexpression. Thus, IGD shows unique characteristics in HpNGNs and a potential multistep tumorigenic process.

[PMID: 38231221] Helicobacter pylori CagA is the first and only bacterial oncoprotein etiologically associated with human cancer. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells via bacterial type IV secretion, CagA acts as a pathogenic/pro-oncogenic scaffold that interacts with and functionally perturbs multiple host proteins such as pro-oncogenic SHP2 phosphatase and polarity-regulating kinase PAR1b/MARK2. Although H. pylori infection is established during early childhood, gastric cancer generally develops in elderly individuals, indicating that oncogenic CagA activity is effectively counteracted at a younger age. Moreover, the eradication of cagA-positive H. pylori cannot cure established gastric cancer, indicating that H. pylori CagA-triggered gastric carcinogenesis proceeds via a hit-and-run mechanism. In addition to its direct oncogenic action, CagA induces BRCAness, a cellular status characterized by replication fork destabilization and loss of error-free homologous recombination-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by inhibiting cytoplasmic-to-nuclear localization of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor. This causes genomic instability that leads to the accumulation of excess mutations in the host cell genome, which may underlie hit-and-run gastric carcinogenesis. The close connection between CagA and BRCAness was corroborated by a recent large-scale case-control study that revealed that the risk of gastric cancer in individuals carrying pathogenic variants of genes that induce BRCAness (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2) dramatically increases upon infection with cagA-positive H. pylori. Accordingly, CagA-mediated BRCAness plays a crucial role in the development of gastric cancer in conjunction with the direct oncogenic action of CagA.

[PMID: 37490912] Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various human genes are key factors in carcinogenesis. However, whether SNPs in bacterial pathogens are similarly crucial in cancer development is unknown. Here, we analyzed 1,043 genomes of the stomach pathogen Helicobacter pylori and pinpointed a SNP in the serine protease HtrA (position serine/leucine 171) that significantly correlates with gastric cancer. Our functional studies reveal that the 171S-to-171L mutation triggers HtrA trimer formation and enhances proteolytic activity and cleavage of epithelial junction proteins occludin and tumor-suppressor E-cadherin. 171L-type HtrA, but not 171S-HtrA-possessing H. pylori, inflicts severe epithelial damage, enhances injection of oncoprotein CagA into epithelial cells, increases NF-κB-mediated inflammation and cell proliferation through nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, and promotes host DNA double-strand breaks, collectively triggering malignant changes. These findings highlight the 171S/L HtrA mutation as a unique bacterial cancer-associated SNP and as a potential biomarker for risk predictions in H. pylori infections.

[PMID: 39129877] Although <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is the most important bacterial carcinogen in gastric cancer (GC), GC can emerge even after <i>H. pylori</i> eradication. Studies suggest that various constituents of the gastric microbiome may influence GC development, but the role of individual pathogens is unclear. Human gastric mucosal samples were analyzed by 16SrRNA sequencing to investigate microbiome composition and its association with clinical parameters, including GC risk. Identified bacteria in the stomach were cocultured with gastric epithelial cells or inoculated into mice, and transcriptomic changes, DNA damage, and inflammation were analyzed. Bacterial reads in GC tissues were examined together with transcriptomic and genetic sequencing data in the cancer genome atlas dataset. Patients after <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> eradication formed 3 subgroups based on the microbial composition revealed by 16SrRNA sequencing. One dysbiotic group enriched with <i>Fusobacterium</i> and <i>Neisseria</i> species was associated with a significantly higher GC incidence. These species activated prooncogenic pathways in gastric epithelial cells and promoted inflammation in mouse stomachs. Sugar chains that constitute gastric mucin attenuate host-bacteria interactions. Metabolites from <i>Fusobacterium</i> species were genotoxic, and the presence of the bacteria was associated with an inflammatory signature and a higher tumor mutation burden. Gastric microbiota in the dysbiotic stomach is associated with GC development after <i>H. pylori</i> eradication and plays a pathogenic role through direct host-bacteria interaction.

[PMID: 35750256] Along with a recent remarkable decrease in Helicobacter pylori-infected individuals, reports of gastric neoplasms such as sporadic foveolar-type gastric adenoma (FGA) in H. pylori-naive patients have been increasing. This tumor, with its raspberry-like appearance, is common in H. pylori-naive gastric mucosa. The current study investigated the genomic features of sporadic FGA. Fresh-frozen sporadic FGA tissue samples from H. pylori-naive patients were subjected to whole genome analysis using a next-generation sequencer. Proliferation ability and apoptotic profiles of human gastric epithelial cells, along with plasmid transfection of candidate variants, were examined. A mean of 6.65 × 10<sup>8</sup> total reads were obtained for each sample. Common genetic abnormalities in well-known proliferation driver genes of conventional gastric dysplasia/cancer were not found. However, a common single-nucleotide variation (SNV) was noted within the DNA-binding domain of the tumor suppressor gene KLF4. This novel SNV was located in the zinc finger 2 region. Additional experiments showed that it significantly suppressed proliferation of gastric epithelial cells compared with wild-type KLF4 plasmid-transfected cells, although suppression was reduced in early apoptotic phase-related genes. A novel SNV in the KLF4 zinc finger 2 region was commonly found in sporadic FGA tissue samples, which may explain the slow-growing properties of this neoplasm.

[PMID: 34942172] Several genetic and environmental factors increase gastric cancer (GC) risk, with Helicobacter pylori being the main environmental agent. GC is thought to emerge through a sequence of morphological changes that have been elucidated on the molecular level. New technologies have shed light onto pathways that are altered in GC, involving mutational and epigenetic changes and altered signaling pathways. Using various new model systems and innovative approaches, the relevance of such alterations for the emergence and progression of GC has been validated. Here, we highlight the key strategies and the resulting achievements. A major step is the characterization of epithelial stem cell behavior in the healthy stomach. These data, obtained through new reporter mouse lines and lineage tracing, enabled insights into the processes that control cellular proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation of gastric stem cells. It has become evident that these cells and pathways are often deregulated in carcinogenesis. Second, insights into how H pylori colonizes gastric glands, directly interacts with stem cells, and alters cellular and genomic integrity, as well as the characterization of tissue responses to infection, provide a comprehensive picture of how this bacterium contributes to gastric carcinogenesis. Third, the development of stem cell- and tissue-specific reporter mice have driven our understanding of the signals and mutations that promote different types of GC and now also enable the study of more advanced, metastasized stages. Finally, organoids from human tissue have allowed insights into gastric carcinogenesis by validating mutational and signaling alterations in human primary cells and opening a route to predicting responses to personalized treatment.

[PMID: 33989515] Infection with CagA-producing Helicobacter pylori plays a causative role in the development of gastric cancer. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells, CagA deregulates prooncogenic phosphatase SHP2 while inhibiting polarity-regulating kinase PAR1b through complex formation. Here, we show that CagA/PAR1b interaction subverts nuclear translocation of BRCA1 by inhibiting PAR1b-mediated BRCA1 phosphorylation. It hereby induces BRCAness that promotes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) while disabling error-free homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. The CagA/PAR1b interaction also stimulates Hippo signaling that circumvents apoptosis of DNA-damaged cells, giving cells time to repair DSBs through error-prone mechanisms. The DSB-activated p53-p21<sup>Cip1</sup> axis inhibits proliferation of CagA-delivered cells, but the inhibition can be overcome by p53 inactivation. Indeed, sequential pulses of CagA in TP53-mutant cells drove somatic mutation with BRCAness-associated genetic signatures. Expansion of CagA-delivered cells with BRCAness-mediated genome instability, from which CagA-independent cancer-predisposing cells arise, provides a plausible ""hit-and-run mechanism"" of H. pylori CagA for gastric carcinogenesis.

[PMID: 33918902] Epidemiological, clinical, and biological studies convincingly demonstrate that chronic inflammation predisposes to the development of human cancers. In digestive organs, inflammation-associated cancers include colitis-associated colorectal cancers, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-associated gastric cancer, as well as Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma associated with chronic duodenogastric-esophageal reflux. Cancer is a genomic disease, and stepwise accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations of tumor-related genes leads to the development of tumor cells. Recent genome analyses show that genetic alterations, which are evoked by inflammation, are latently accumulated in inflamed epithelial cells of digestive organs. Production of reactive oxygen and aberrant expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, a nucleotide-editing enzyme, could be induced in inflamed gastrointestinal epithelial cells and play a role as a genomic modulator of inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. Understanding the molecular linkage between inflammation and genetic alterations will open up a new field of tumor biology and provide a novel strategy for the prevention of inflammation-associated tumorigenesis.",10

The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187355] Herein, a renewable polarity-switchable PEC biosensor is reported for a highly sensitive and selective assay of circRNA in human whole blood, and machine learning is exploited to assist in the circRNA intelligent diagnosis. The target circRNA-DNA3 binary structure can hybridize competitively with DNA2 in triple helix molecular to generate three-way junction probe, and Exo Ⅲ specifically cleaves DNA2 to release the circRNA-DNA3 binary complex for signal cyclic amplification. Then, Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanospheres are introduced into PEC platform, leading to the switching from anodic to cathodic photocurrents. Interestingly, biotin can competitively bind to Cu<sub>2</sub>O-SA, making the ITO/CdS/T-COF/CS/DNA1 electrode reusable for circRNA analysis. The built PEC biosensor exhibits a low detection limit (7.6 aM), excellent selectivity and satisfactory renewability. Moreover, the developed PEC biosensor for human whole blood circSATB2 assay can effectively distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Importantly, the machine learning is adopted to explore the potential pattern hidden in PEC data, and the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of circRNA intelligent diagnosis all reach 100 %. Machine learning-assisted renewable polarity-switchable PEC biosensor provides a new approach for circRNA analysis and early intelligent diagnosis of cancer.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41187174] Pitanga (Eugenia uniflora L.), a member of the Myrtaceae family, is native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and distributed across various ecological environments, including regions with contrasting edaphoclimatic conditions. Known for its production of secondary metabolites with significant biological activity, pitanga holds considerable pharmacological potential. Genomic and transcriptomic resources for this species are therefore valuable for understanding the genetic mechanisms that enable its adaptation to diverse ecosystems and for identifying candidate genes relevant for crop improvement and bioprospection. To explore whether genetic diversity is associated with population adaptation to environmental conditions, we first generated a draft genome of E. uniflora, totaling 385.1 Mbp with an N50 value of 26,199 bp, assembled de novo from Illumina-sequence reads. Likewise, gene prediction, based on Viridiplantae protein references, identified 30,663 protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics revealed 2,219 orthologous clusters, 40% of which were functionally annotated and encompassing 1,772 gene ontology terms. This draft genome also facilitated the identification of microsatellite markers, whose variation was analyzed across pitanga samples from two contrasting natural environments: Restinga and Riparian forest. The microsatellite profile showed a natural bias towards monomeric repeats, with genetic diversity differences across both populations that could be used as molecular markers for phenotype selection and plant breeding. Furthermore, RNA sequencing coupled with a Transcriptogram approach revealed significant differences in gene expression between the two populations. Pitangas from the Restinga ecosystem exhibited a stronger stress response, with distinct gene expression patterns associated with osmoprotection, cell wall modification, detoxification, nutrient balance, and epigenetic regulation. These patterns are likely linked to enhanced adaptation to the water and osmotic stress conditions, characteristic of this environment. Together, these findings enhance our knowledge of genetic diversity within E. uniflora populations and the molecular basis of their environmental adaptability. Such insights are critical for understanding how plants rapidly adapt to climate change and how these adaptations affect population dynamics, important for conservation strategies, population management, and the development of resilient cultivars.

[PMID: 41187170] Germ layer specification represents a critical transition where pluripotent cells acquire lineage-specific identities. We identify the maternal transcription factors Foxi2 and Sox3 to be pivotal master regulators of ectodermal germ layer specification in Xenopus. Ectopic co-expression of Foxi2 and Sox3 in prospective endodermal tissue induces the expression of ectodermal markers while suppressing mesendodermal markers. Transcriptomics analyses reveal that Foxi2 and Sox3 jointly and independently regulate hundreds of ectodermal target genes. During early cleavage stages, Foxi2 and Sox3 pre-bind to key cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), marking sites that later recruit Ep300 and facilitate H3K27ac deposition, thereby shaping the epigenetic landscape of the ectodermal genome. These CRMs are highly enriched within ectoderm-specific super-enhancers (SEs). Our findings highlight the pivotal role of ectodermal SE-associated CRMs in precise and robust ectodermal gene activation, establishing Foxi2 and Sox3 as central architects of ectodermal lineage specification.

[PMID: 41186927] Sirtuins have gained significant prominence in scientific research due to their involvement in a wide array of biological processes, including DNA repair, genome stability, transcription modulation, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of their function has been implicated in various pathologies, including cancer, where sirtuins exhibit context-dependent effects. Consequently, the development of sirtuin inhibitors and activators remains an exceptionally important field of research, focusing on the design of selective modulators targeting individual sirtuin isoforms. This review includes the patents regarding sirtuin modulators released from 2020 to 2024 and provides a concise overview of the most relevant modulators developed so far. Relevant patents were systematically identified through comprehensive searches in PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), Google Patents (https://patents.google.com), and Espacenet (https://worldwide.espacenet.com). Sirtuin modulators are pivotal in addressing aging, metabolism, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Sirtuins regulate key cellular processes like DNA repair, genome stability, and mitochondrial function. Activators show promise in mitigating many age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and neurodegeneration. Inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in oncology and neurodegenerative conditions. Advances in PROTAC technology enable selective degradation of specific isoforms, enhancing therapeutic precision. With progress in drug design and high-throughput screening, sirtuin modulators hold immense potential to revolutionize treatments for complex medical challenges.

[PMID: 41186896] Lung cancer is associated with one of the highest cancer-related mortality rates and is the second most prevalent cancer worldwide. Diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer has different challenges as in most cases, and it is often diagnosed late when metastatic spread is widely disseminated. The development of chemo- and radioresistance of lung cancer, as well as a lack of specific treatment, has resulted in a very high mortality and morbidity. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a group of RNAs with a wide spectrum of functions required for homeostasis. These RNAs modulate the expression of proteins posttranslationally and control the cell phenotype. Studies have shown that these RNAs could act as both oncogene and oncosuppressor, and due to their great therapeutic and diagnostic potential, recent studies have also focused on their use as biomarkers for early detection of cancers. Understanding the current findings in this field would help scientists to have an overview about different ncRNAs and their role in lung cancer progression. This chapter explores the landscape of ncRNA research related to lung cancer, highlighting the potential for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

[PMID: 41186893] Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, with its pathogenesis involving complex biological processes such as DNA damage, epigenetic modification and oncogene mutation. Over the past two decades, the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the occurrence, metastasis and progression of HCC has received increasing attention. As an important noncoding RNA molecule, lncRNAs play a key role in regulating gene expression, affecting RNA transcription and mRNA stability. This review elucidates the potential pathogenic processes of HCC and elaborates on the synthesis mechanisms of the above three non-coding RNAs. It comprehensively summarizes various non-coding RNAs that have been identified as playing key regulatory roles in HCC, as well as how these non-coding RNAs affect disease progression by regulating gene expression and protein functions. For example: lncRNAs such as NEAT1, DSCR8, PNUTS, HULC, and HOTAIR can play different roles in the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HCC cells in different ways. lncRNAs such as HClnc1, LINC01343, FAM111A-DT, CERS6-AS1, and TLNC1 significantly affect the progression of HCC by regulating key signaling axes or protein functions, and are closely related to the prognosis of patients. In addition, we also discuss the potential of lncRNAs as therapeutic targets for HCC, such as: lncRNA MIR31HG, CASC2c, and lncRNA AC115619. Furthermore, we also explore the application prospects of lncRNAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new perspectives and directions for future HCC research.

[PMID: 41186794] The number of deaths from colorectal cancer in Japan continues to rise, with over 50,000 deaths recorded in 2018. In the 2024 edition, revisions to all aspects of treatment were undertaken, with corrections and additions made based on knowledge gained since the 2022 version (drug therapy) and the 2019 version (other treatments). The Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR) guidelines 2024 for the treatment of colorectal cancer have been prepared to present standard treatment strategies, reduce disparities among institutions, avoid both unnecessary and insufficient treatment, and enhance mutual understanding between healthcare professionals and patients by making these guidelines accessible to the public. These guidelines were developed through consensus by the JSCCR Guideline Committee, following a careful review of evidence retrieved from literature searches and considering the medical insurance system and actual clinical practice in Japan. Therefore, these guidelines serve as a tool for managing colorectal cancer in real-world clinical settings. More specifically, they can be used to support obtaining informed consent from patients and selecting the most appropriate treatment method for each patient. Controversial topics were selected as clinical questions, and recommendations were provided. Each recommendation is accompanied by an evidence classification and a recommendation category, both based on consensus reached by the Guideline Committee members. This article presents the English version of the JSCCR guidelines 2024.

[PMID: 41186789] Despite evidence linking histone lactylation to tumorigenesis, its specific regulatory role in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is still not well defined. Histone H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la) levels in LSCC tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot, showing significantly higher levels than non-tumor tissues. Treatment with the sodium oxamate (SO) effectively reduced H3K18la level, thereby suppressing LSCC cell proliferation and migration while inducing apoptosis. Mechanistically, H3K18la upregulated Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression, which in turn activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway to promote aggressive LSCC phenotypes. Our findings demonstrate that H3K18la facilitates LSCC progression by enhancing malignant cellular behaviors, thereby offering potential therapeutic targets for LSCC intervention.",10

Adult women with HIV adherence difficulties in a monogamous relationship with a male partner for ≥6 months were recruited in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Twenty couples were randomized (1:1) to either START Together, a five-session manualized behavioral intervention, or treatment as usual, adherence counseling referral. Assessments were completed at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up. Of the ten couples randomized to START Together, 70% attended at least one intervention session (feasibility); of those, 71% attended all five sessions (acceptability). Independently rated interventionist fidelity was very high (<i>M</i> ≥ 2.94 out of 3). Women's self-reported antiretroviral therapy adherence increased similarly in both interventions. For men, self-reported antiretroviral therapy adherence increased up to 25 percentage points in START Together, but not treatment as usual. Findings suggest that START Together may be potentially beneficial for improving HIV outcomes for men.

[PMID: 39345026] Uganda is burdened by high unintended and teen pregnancies, high sexually transmitted infections, and harm caused by unsafe abortion. Explore factors influencing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in Uganda by synthesizing evidence from qualitative studies using a scoping review. Original qualitative peer-reviewed research studies published between 2002 and 2023 in any language exploring factors influencing SRHR in Uganda. Eight databases searched using qualitative/mixed methods search filters and no language limits. Information extracted included author, article title, publication year, study aims, participant description, data collection type, sample size, main findings, factors at the individual, interpersonal, community, and policy levels, implications for SRHR in Uganda, and study limitations. Quality of the selected articles was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. One hundred seventy-three studies met inclusion criteria. At the individual level, knowledge and attitudes toward SRHR, risky sexual behavior, and access to maternal SRHR services were identified as critical factors influencing health outcomes. Interpersonal factors included communication with sexual partners and relationships with family, school, and community members. Healthcare organization factors included adolescent access to education, SRHR services, and HIV prevention. Cultural and social factors included gendered norms and male involvement in SRHR. Policy-level factors included the importance of aligning policy and practice. Multiple factors at individual, interpersonal, community, healthcare, cultural, and policy levels were found to influence SRHR in Uganda. The findings suggest that interventions targeting multiple levels of the socio-ecological system may be necessary to improve SRHR outcomes. This review highlights the need for a holistic approach that considers the broader socio-ecological context. Reducing identified gaps in the literature, particularly between policy and practice related to SRHR, is urgently needed in Uganda. We hope this review will inform the development of policies and interventions to improve SRHR outcomes.

[PMID: 38754986] Partner notification (PN) is key to the control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Digital interventions have been used to facilitate PN. A scoping review was conducted to describe the interventions used, user preferences and acceptability of digital PN interventions from patient and partner perspectives. A systematic literature search was conducted of eight databases for articles published in English, available online with digital PN outcome data. Articles were assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Quantitative and qualitative data were synthesised and analysed using thematic analysis. Twenty-six articles met the eligibility criteria. Articles were heterogeneous in quality and design, with the majority using quantitative methods. Nine articles focused solely on bacterial STIs (five on syphilis; four on chlamydia), one on HIV, two on syphilis and HIV, and 14 included multiple STIs, of which 13 included HIV. There has been a shift over time from digital PN interventions solely focusing on notifying partners, to interventions including elements of partner management, such as facilitation of partner testing and treatment, or sharing of STI test results (between index patients and tested sex partners). Main outcomes measured were number of partners notified (13 articles), partner testing/consultation (eight articles) and treatment (five articles). Relationship type and STI type appeared to affect digital PN preferences for index patients with digital methods preferred for casual rather than established partner types. Generally, partners preferred face-to-face PN. Digital PN to date mainly focuses on notifying partners rather than comprehensive partner management. Despite an overall preference for face-to-face PN with partners, digital PN could play a useful role in improving outcomes for certain partner types and infections. Further research needs to understand the impact of digital PN interventions on specific PN outcomes, their effectiveness for different infections and include health economic evaluations.

[PMID: 37096329] Despite recent emphasis on couples-based HIV prevention interventions, efficacious interventions for Latino male couples have yet to be tested. The study examined the feasibility and acceptability of the Connecting Latinos en Pareja (CLP) intervention, a couples-based HIV prevention intervention for Latino male couples. This pilot demonstrated high feasibility, meeting targets for recruitment, retention, and intervention completion. We recruited a diverse cohort of 46 individuals/23 couples with a retention rate of 80% over 6 months and a 100% intervention completion rate in both conditions (four structured couple sessions in each condition). This pilot RCT was not powered to detect significant intervention impact on the primary outcome; however, there was a significant increase in relationship functioning among couples in the intervention group relative to controls and promising trends in changes in several key outcome and mediating variables. Secondary analysis documented trends in the expected directions for several other key hypothesized mechanisms of action (stimulant use, psychological symptoms, quality of life) as well as the primary outcome of proportion of protected sex acts (overall and broken out by main vs. outside partners). Qualitative exit interviews revealed high levels of acceptability of the CLP intervention. Participants highlighted affective component of the intervention and perceived effectiveness in improving dyadic communication skills and safer sex practices. Our findings show that a pilot trial of CLP is highly feasible and acceptable, with CLP demonstrating promising evidence of changes in key intervention mechanisms.

[PMID: 36628880] For women in South Africa, engaging in exchange sex, including transactional sex (TS), or sex work (SW), is associated with several shared poor health outcomes; yet the practices themselves differ in meaningful ways. SW is a form of commodity exchange, while TS is grounded in gendered relationship expectations of male provision and aspects of emotional intimacy. Additionally, exchange sex types could be imagined on a ""continuum of instrumentality"" from relationships that do not include material support; to those characterized, but not driven by support; to those primarily motivated by material support. We use cross-sectional data from 644 women ages 18-30 enrolled in a trial addressing intimate partner violence in urban KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to assess whether these conceptualizations may also map onto different types or levels of risk. Using self-reports, we developed four exchange sex relationship categories corresponding to a continuum of instrumentality: no exchange-based relationship; TS with a main partner only; TS with a casual partner; and SW. Using tests of association and adjusted logistic regression models, we compared socio-economic and behavioural risk factors, and health outcomes across reported forms of exchange sex. We find little difference between women who report no exchange sex and those who report TS only with a main partner. By contrast, as compared to women not in exchange sex, women in casual TS and SW were poorer, and significantly more likely to report problematic alcohol use, past drug use, prior non-partner sexual violence, and PTSD; with aOR higher for women in SW for many outcomes. When comparing casual TS to SW, we find women in SW held more gender equitable attitudes and were more likely to report modern contraceptive use. We discuss the implications for distinguishing between TS and SW, and use of the continuum of instrumentality conceptualization for research and programming.

[PMID: 36194890] It is well-established that experiencing sexual abuse and violence can have a range of detrimental impacts; a wide variety of interventions exist to support survivors in the aftermath. Understanding the experiences and perspectives of survivors receiving such interventions, along with those of their family members, and the professionals who deliver them is important for informing decision making as to what to offer survivors, for developing new interventions, and enhancing their acceptability. This review sought to: 1. identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring the experiences of child and adult survivors of sexual abuse and violence, and their caregivers, regarding psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting survivors and preventing negative health outcomes in terms of benefits, risks/harms and barriers; 2. identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring the experiences of professionals who deliver psychosocial interventions for sexual abuse and violence in terms of perceived benefits, risks/harms and barriers for survivors and their families/caregivers; 3. develop a conceptual understanding of how different factors influence uptake, dropout or completion, and outcomes from psychosocial interventions for sexual abuse and violence; 4. develop a conceptual understanding of how features and types of interventions responded to the needs of different user/survivor groups (e.g. age groups; types of abuse exposure; migrant populations) and contexts (healthcare/therapeutic settings; low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)); 5. explore how the findings of this review can enhance our understanding of the findings from the linked and related reviews assessing the effectiveness of interventions aimed at supporting survivors and preventing negative health outcomes. In August 2021 we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and nine other databases. We also searched for unpublished reports and qualitative reports of quantitative studies in a linked systematic review, together with reference checking, citation searches and contacting authors and other researchers to identify relevant studies. We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies (with an identifiable qualitative component) that were linked to a psychosocial intervention aimed at supporting survivors of sexual abuse and violence. Eligible studies focused on at least one of three participant groups: survivors of any age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity or [dis]ability who had received a psychosocial intervention; their carers, family members or partners; and professionals delivering such interventions. We placed no restrictions in respect of settings, locations, intervention delivery formats or durations. Six review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified. We extracted data using a form designed for this synthesis, then used this information and an appraisal of data richness and quality in order to stratify the studies using a maximum variation approach. We assessed the methodological limitations using the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We coded directly onto the sampled papers using NVivo and synthesised data using a thematic synthesis methodology and used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We used a narrative synthesis and matrix model to integrate our qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) findings with those of intervention review findings. We identified 97 eligible studies and sampled 37 of them for our analysis. Most sampled studies were from high-income countries, with four from middle-income and two from low-income countries. In 27 sampled studies, the participants were survivors, in three they were intervention facilitators. Two included all three of our stakeholder groups, and five included two of our groups. The studies explored a wide range of psychosocial interventions, with only one type of intervention explored in more than one study. The review indicates that features associated with the context in which interventions were delivered had an impact on how individuals accessed and experienced interventions. This included organisational features, such as staff turnover, that could influence survivors' engagement with interventions; the setting or location in which interventions were delivered; and the characteristics associated with who delivered the interventions. Studies that assess the effectiveness of interventions typically assess their impact on mental health; however, as well as finding benefits to mental health, our QES found that study participants felt interventions also had positive impacts on their physical health, mood, understanding of trauma, interpersonal relationships and enabled them to re-engage with a wide range of areas in their lives. Participants explained that features of interventions and their contexts that best enabled them to benefit from interventions were also often things that could be a barrier to benefiting from interventions. For example, the relationship with the therapist, when open and warm was a benefit, but if such a relationship could not be achieved, it was a barrier. Survivors' levels of readiness and preparedness to both start and end interventions could have positive (if they were ready) or negative (if they were not) impacts. Study participants identified the potential risks and harms associated with completing interventions but felt that it was important to face and process trauma. Some elements of interventions were specific to the intervention type (e.g. faith-based interventions), or related to an experience of an intervention that held particular relevance to subgroups of survivors (e.g. minority groups); these issues could impact how individuals experienced delivering or receiving interventions. We had high or moderate confidence in all but one of our review findings. Further research in low- and middle-income settings, with male survivors of sexual abuse and violence and those from minority groups could strengthen the evidence for low and moderate confidence findings. We found that few interventions had published quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Since this QES has highlighted important aspects that could enable interventions to be more suitable for survivors, using a range of methodologies would provide valuable information that could enhance intervention uptake, completion and effectiveness. This study has shown that although survivors often found interventions difficult, they also appreciated that they needed to work through trauma, which they said resulted in a wide range of benefits. Therefore, listening to survivors and providing appropriate interventions, at the right time for them, can make a significant difference to their health and well-being.

[PMID: 35025909] Systematic efforts are needed to prepare persons newly diagnosed with acute or chronic HIV infection to cope. We examined how patients dealt with this news, looking at how readiness to accept an HIV diagnosis impacted treatment outcomes, prevention of transmission, and HIV status disclosure. We examined vulnerability and agency over time and considered implications for policy and practice. A qualitative sub-study was embedded in the Tambua Mapema (""Discover Early"") Plus (TMP) study (NCT03508908), conducted in coastal Kenya between 2017 and 2020, which was a stepped wedge trial to evaluate an opt-out HIV-1 nucleic acid testing intervention diagnosing acute and chronic HIV infections. Diagnosed participants were offered antiretroviral therapy (ART), viral load monitoring, HIV partner notification services, and provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to their uninfected partners. Data were analyzed using thematic approaches. Participants included 24 individuals who completed interviews at four time points (2 weeks and 3, 6, and 9 months after diagnosis), including 18 patients (11 women and 7 men) and 6 partners (1 woman, 5 men, of whom 4 men started PrEP). Acceptance of HIV status was often a long, individualized, and complex process, whereby participants' coping strategies affected day-to-day issues and health over time. Relationship status strongly impacted coping. In some instances, couples supported each other, but in others, couples separated. Four main themes impacted participants' sense of agency: acceptance of diagnosis and commitment to ART; positive feedback after attaining viral load suppression; recognition of partner supportive role and focus on sustained healthcare support whereby religious meaning was often key to successful transition. To support patients with acute or newly diagnosed chronic HIV, healthcare and social systems must be more responsive to the needs of the individual, while also improving quality of care, strengthening continuity of care across facilities, and promoting community support.

[PMID: 33927009] To develop a classification of sexual partner types for use in partner notification (PN) for STIs. A four-step process: (1) an iterative synthesis of five sources of evidence: scoping review of social and health sciences literature on partner types; analysis of relationship types in dating apps; systematic review of PN intervention content; and review of PN guidelines; qualitative interviews with public, patients and health professionals to generate an initial comprehensive classification; (2) multidisciplinary clinical expert consultation to revise the classification; (3) piloting of the revised classification in sexual health clinics during a randomised controlled trial of PN; (4) application of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify index patients' willingness to engage in PN for each partner type. Five main partner types emerged from the evidence synthesis and consultation: 'established partner', 'new partner', 'occasional partner', 'one-off partner' and 'sex worker'. The types differed across several dimensions, including likely perceptions of sexual exclusivity, likelihood of sex reoccurring between index patient and sex partner. Sexual health professionals found the classification easy to operationalise. During the trial, they assigned all 3288 partners described by 2223 index patients to a category. The TDF analysis suggested that the partner types might be associated with different risks of STI reinfection, onward transmission and index patients' engagement with PN. We developed an evidence-informed, useable classification of five sexual partner types to underpin PN practice and other STI prevention interventions. Analysis of biomedical, psychological and social factors that distinguish different partner types shows how each could warrant a tailored PN approach. This classification could facilitate the use of partner-centred outcomes. Additional studies are needed to determine the utility of the classification to improve measurement of the impact of PN strategies and help focus resources.

[PMID: 31812683] To date, several aspects of inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) surgical procedure have been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to review the evidence associated with IPP implantation and provide clinical recommendations on behalf of the European Society for Sexual Medicine (ESSM). Overall, 130 peer-reviewed studies and systematic reviews, which were published from 2007-2018 in the English language, were included. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and open-label prospective and retrospective studies. The panel provided statements exploring patients and partner expectations, satisfaction in male and phalloplasty cohorts, the impact of penile length, girth and implant type, reservoir placement, the influence of comorbidities, and social circumstances. Levels of evidence were provided according to the Oxford 2011 criteria and graded as for the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine recommendations. In the preoperative setting, it is fundamental to identify and interact with difficult patients with the intention of enhancing the surgeon's ability to establish the surgeon-patient relationship, reduce physical and legal risk, as well as enhancing patient satisfaction. To address this need, the mnemonic Compulsive, Unrealistic, Revision, Surgeon Shopping, Entitled, Denial, and Psychiatric (""CURSED"") has been suggested to identify patients who are at high risk of dissatisfaction. The current recommendations suggest improving glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Available evidence suggests evaluating transplant recipients with the criteria of Barry, consisting of stable graft function for >6 months, avoidance of intra-abdominal reservoir placement, and low-dose immunosuppression. HIV status does not represent a contraindication for surgery. Smoking, peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of revision surgery. Patients with spinal cord injury may receive IPP. Patients aged ≥70 years, as well as obese patients, can be offered IPP. The IPP implantation can be performed in patients with stable Peyronie's disease. Ectopic high submuscular reservoir placement can be considered as an alternative method. There is a relevant lack of high-level data and definite conclusions in certain areas remain difficult to draw. All studies have been evaluated by a panel of experts providing recommendations for clinical practice. Because of lack of sufficient prospective data, some of the included studies are retrospective and this could be stated as a limitation. This ESSM position statement provides recommendations on optimization of patient outcome by patient selection, and individualized peri- and intra-operative management. ESSM encourages centers to collaborate and to create prospective, multicenter registries in order to address this topic of increasing importance. Osmonov D, Christopher AN, Blecher GA, et al. Clinical Recommendations from the European Society for Sexual Medicine Exploring Partner Expectations, Satisfaction in Male and Phalloplasty Cohorts, the Impact of Penile Length, Girth and Implant Type, Reservoir Placement, and the Influence of Comorbidities and Social Circumstances.

[PMID: 30602433] Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM) continue to be the group most heavily impacted by HIV in the United States. Substantial evidence indicates that up to two-thirds of new HIV infections occur in the context of a main partnership. Couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC) has been shown to be a promising and effective strategy for increasing HIV prevention uptake among male couples; however, YMSM who are new to relationships may not have yet developed the efficacy, negotiation, and communication skills to navigate HIV testing in their relationship and communicate around developing a prevention plan. This study aims to develop and test a relationship skills-focused HIV prevention intervention for YMSM and their partners. The intervention consists of two telehealth-delivered sessions: the first focuses on relationship skills and the second consists of CHTC and prevention planning. Both sessions are attended by both members of the dyad. This protocol describes the development of the proposed intervention (We Prevent) and pilot test to examine its feasibility and preliminary efficacy. The intervention will include two motivational interviewing-based sessions: session one is a relationship skills-building session, focused on techniques to explore and build communication skills in a relationship, to help YMSM develop and enhance necessary skills for their current and future relationships; the second session is a CHTC session with YMSM and their partners, to help them develop an HIV prevention plan. Through qualitative data collection and a one-arm pilot with YMSM, we will develop and refine a developmentally appropriate relationship skills session as an addition to the current CHTC intervention. We will then conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted two-session telehealth intervention for YMSM versus a control group receiving one session only-a CHTC session delivered via telehealth. The We Prevent intervention is designed to increase uptake of HIV prevention, shown through self-reported reductions in condomless sex and increases in knowledge and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis. In addition, the intervention is designed to increase HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing. STI incidence is examined as a secondary outcome. A cost-input analysis will examine the costs associated with intervention delivery to inform future scale-up of the intervention. Drawing on theory and existing CHTC protocols delivered with video-based counseling, this proposed intervention affords the opportunity to empower YMSM with the skills necessary to communicate with their partners and protect themselves from HIV in their current and future relationships.

Helicobacter pylori-induced aberrant NF-kB-dependent expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase contributes to the mutagenesis of host DNA.,Helicobacter pylori AND NF-kB-dependent AND AID expression AND host DNA mutagenesis,"41187167,41186255,41185498,41183418,41183072,41183015,41182802,41182632,41182500,41182092","[PMID: 41187167] Pepsinogen (PG) and gastrin-17 (G-17) are widely used in the screening of gastric diseases. Our cross-sectional clinical study investigates the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, sex, and age on serum levels of PG and G-17 in asymptomatic subjects in Rizhao, China. A total of 12,746 asymptomatic subjects were enrolled in the study between August 2023 and January 2024. Serum levels of pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII), and G-17 were measured using the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method, and the PGI/PGII ratio (PGR) was calculated. HP infection was detected using the Colloidal Gold Method, and the relationship between age, sex, HP infection, and serum PG and G-17 levels was analyzed. HP prevalence was 19.33% in this study. The serum PGI, PGII, and G-17 levels were significantly higher in the HP-positive group compared to the HP-negative group (P < 0.001), whereas the PGR was notably lower in the HP-positive group (P < 0.001). Spearman correlation tests analysis indicated a positive correlation between HP infection and PGI, PGII, and G-17 (r = 0.144, P < 0.001; r = 0.418, P < 0.001; r = 0.268, P < 0.001), and a negative correlation with PGR (r = -0.438, P < 0.001). ROC curve shows that the AUC of the combination of PGI, PGII, PGR, and G-17 in diagnosing HP positive were 0.605 (95% CI: 0.592-0.618), 0.805 (95% CI: 0.795-0.816), 0.820 (95% CI: 0.811-0.830), and 0.709 (95% CI: 0.698-0.720), respectively. The detection rates of abnormal PG and G-17 levels were significantly higher in the HP-positive group than in the HP-negative group (P < 0.01). Males exhibited significantly higher levels of both PGI and PGII than females (P < 0.001). The G-17 levels were higher in males than females in the 50-59 age group (P < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that serum levels of both PGI and PGII exhibited an increase with age. Serum PGI, PGII, and G-17 levels were positively correlated with age, although the relationship was weak (r = 0.228, P < 0.001; r = 0.246, P < 0.001; r = 0.042, P < 0.001). Following adjustment for sex and Helicobacter pylori infection covariates using a restricted cubic spline (RCS), the analysis revealed a significant overall association between PGI, PGII, PGR, and G-17 serum levels and age (P for overall < 0.001, P for overall < 0.001, P for overall = 0.003, and P for overall < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship was found between PGI, PGR, and G-17 levels and age (nonlinear P = 0.004, nonlinear P = 0.001, and nonlinear P = 0.008, respectively), whereas PGII exhibited a linear correlation (nonlinear P = 0.841). Serum levels of PG and G-17 are associated with HP infection, sex, and age. These findings provide region-specific insights into the relationships between these biomarkers and HP infection, highlighting the importance of considering HP infection status, sex, and age in future research.

[PMID: 41186255] <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (HP) infection is directly associated with over 90% of all gastric cancer (GC) cases. Currently available HP tests are prone to false negatives and are inapt for decentralization. Reliable and user-friendly detection platforms for timely diagnosis and routine monitoring are critical to patient survival. Herein, we targeted this unmet need by developing a novel biosensing platform that strategically combined the robust versatility of electrochemical techniques with the sensitivity and specificity of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to enable the accurate detection of HP at the point-of-care (POC). The biosensor design consisted of an underlying screen-printed carbon electrode (SCPE), sequentially modified with (i) highly conductive acid-functionalized sp2 graphene (Gr) and (ii) needle-like gold microstructures encapsulated with (iii) pH-sensitive polyaniline (PANI), assembled between laser-cut cover layers with a built-in reaction chamber for facile sample handling and detection. LAMP was performed using synthesized primers targeting the HP glmM gene. The amplification inherently generates H<sup>+</sup>, triggering pH variations, which are precisely tracked by the developed biosensor to simultaneously monitor amplicon growth and quantify HP DNA concentrations via two modes: continuous mode and segmented mode. High sensitivity in a wide linear range (1 to 107 copies/μL) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 copy/μL is reported. Furthermore, the excellent correlation with clinical results underscored the practical feasibility of this platform to allow reliable early diagnosis of HP infections and serve as a viable alternative to gastric endoscopy.

[PMID: 41185498] Pancreatic cancer (PC) presents unique challenges to traditional immunotherapy due to its immunosuppressive microenvironment and low mutation burden. Research into antibody-mediated immune responses, which has been extensively applied in various cancer types, is also applicable to the study of pancreatic cancer. Using public Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and genetic instruments, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore causal relationships between 46 antibody-mediated immune responses and PC. We employed five MR methods. Cochran's Q statistic and corresponding p-values from the MR Egger and Inverse Variance Weighted methods assessed instrument heterogeneity. Egger intercept and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) methods detected potential horizontal pleiotropy, ensuring the robustness of our findings. Our study identified causal links between five antibody-mediated immune responses and pancreatic cancer risk. Chlamydia trachomatis momp A antibody levels were inversely correlated, while Anti-helicobacter pylori IgG seropositivity, Polyomavirus 2 JC VP1 antibody levels, and Merkel cell polyomavirus VP1 antibody levels showed positive correlations. Notably, Anti- Merkel cell polyomavirus IgG seropositivity exhibited strong positive associations across Inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger analyses (p < 0.05). These results suggest that specific Antibody-Mediated Immune Responses may modulate pancreatic carcinogenesis through immune activation or chronic inflammation. The protective association for Chlamydia trachomatis momp A contrasts with the risk-enhancing effects observed for anti-helicobacter pylori IgG and polyomaviruses, highlighting heterogeneous immunobiological pathways that warrant mechanistic investigation. Our study demonstrated a randomized causal effect between antibody-mediated immune responses and pancreatic cancer, offering a new perspective for clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

[PMID: 41183418] In resource-limited laboratory settings non-invasive diagnostics are essential for Helicobacter pylori detection, yet their accuracy varies with disease severity. This study aimed to evaluate diagnostic potential of two widely available non-invasive diagnostic methods - serological antibody (Ab) detection and lateral flow stool-antigen testing (HpSAT) - for their ability both to detect and to differentiate H. pylori-associated gastroduodenal disorders. A total of 128 symptomatic patients (98 with gastritis and 30 with stomach/duodenal ulcer) were enrolled. All underwent ELISA-IgG, rapid Ab test and HpSAT; 17 ulcer patients additionally had a biopsy rapid-urease test (RUT). Per-index composite reference standard (CRS) was established to define infection status. As a no-gold-standard sensitivity analysis, we implemented a Bayesian latent class model (LCM) with local dependence between ELISA and Rapid Ab test. Under the CRS, ELISA had sensitivity 98.2 % and specificity 62.5 %; Rapid Ab test had 91.2 % and 53.6 %; HpSAT had 63.5 % and 75.0 %. For ulcer vs. gastritis discrimination in the full cohort, HpSAT had the highest overall accuracy (65.6 %) via balanced sensitivity (76.7 %) and higher specificity (62.2 %). Bayesian LCM estimated Se/Sp as: ELISA Se/Sp 64.6 %/80.9 %; Rapid Ab 91.7 %/63.8 %; HpSAT 94.8 % /74.2 %). HpSAT showed the most balanced non-invasive performance for detecting active H. pylori and the strongest discrimination of ulcer versus gastritis. Where urease breath testing (UBT) is unavailable, a tiered approach-HpSAT first-line for suspected active infection/ulceration, with serology as adjunct appears pragmatic. Prospective studies using a uniform reference standard are needed.

[PMID: 41183072] Chronic infections such as Helicobacter pylori (Hp), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) significantly contribute to the global cancer burden, necessitating targeted and cost-effective prevention strategies. The Cancer Prevention at Work (CPW) project pioneers an innovative approach by integrating primary prevention interventions into occupational health surveillance (OHS) programs, thus leveraging existing workplace infrastructure for a large-scale impact. CPW aims to screen and treat Hp and HCV infections, and promote HPV vaccination, targeting not only workers but also their household members. CPW aims to support accessibility, facilitate earlier detection, and strengthen cancer prevention at a population level. The project employs a micro-elimination strategy for HCV, supports data-driven risk assessment for Hp and HPV, and promotes evidence-based communication to reduce HPV vaccine hesitancy. A comprehensive data management framework ensures harmonized data collection, integration, and cost-effectiveness analysis, aiming at providing robust evidence for policy recommendations. Through pilot studies conducted across four European countries, CPW assesses the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and economic sustainability, with the potential to inform future occupational cancer prevention initiatives across Europe. This work summarizes the CPW project's research framework designed to integrate infection-related cancer prevention into workplace health programs across Europe. It details the project's goals, methods, and discusses the impact on occupational cancer prevention.

[PMID: 41183015] Bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target their bacterial hosts, hold significant potential for biotechnology and medicine, especially in combating multidrug-resistant infections. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying phage infection remain largely underexplored. Precise, site-specific mutagenesis of phages is a powerful tool to elucidate gene functions and phage-host interactions. However, a major challenge in phage genome mutagenesis is the presence of phage DNA modifications that interfere with conventional genome editing tools like CRISPR-Cas. While CRISPR-Cas systems have been used successfully for targeted mutagenesis in various organisms, their effectiveness in phage mutagenesis is often limited by DNA modifications such as cytosine glycosylation. To overcome this barrier, we developed an efficient method that temporarily reduces the abundance of phage DNA modifications, enabling efficient CRISPR-Cas targeting and precise mutation introduction into phage genomes. Specifically, we use the Ten Eleven Translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase from Naegleria gruberi (NgTET), which iteratively demodifies methylated and hydroxymethylated cytosines in DNA. By oxidizing hydroxymethylated cytosines within phage DNA, NgTET prevents subsequent cytosine modification like glycosylation and significantly enhances the efficiency of Cas-mediated DNA cleavage. In conclusion, the scarless and precise genome-editing approach presented here enables the efficient introduction of point mutations while maintaining the native gene architecture in phage genomes. By preserving intact transcriptional and translational frameworks, this method minimizes unintended disruptions to complex regulatory networks. This is particularly important for investigating essential or multifunctional phage proteins. The ability to generate targeted genetic modifications without introducing extraneous sequences significantly expands the experimental toolkit for phage biology. This strategy not only facilitates detailed functional studies but also enhances the potential for rational engineering of phages for therapeutic and biotechnological applications.

[PMID: 41182632] Amastigotes are the replicative intracellular life cycle stage of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. They have the ability to proliferate in any nucleated mammalian cell. A greater understanding of amastigote biology would greatly aid drug development since this life cycle stage is the principal target of chemotherapy. Reports have linked recrudescence following drug treatment with the possible existence of a quiescent amastigote phenotype. However, the lack of a rapid and straightforward method for isolating amastigotes from infected host cells has limited research progress in this area. This is particularly the case with omics technology, where the current complex fractionation and purification procedures can act to perturb RNA and protein expression. Here, we outline a methodology that largely overcomes these problems. Our protocol exploits MP Bio-Lysing Matrix M tubes to promote the differential lysis of host cells and the release of intact amastigotes in a 1-min time frame. Immediate treatment of the lysate with CellCover reagent then maintains RNA and protein in their native states. Amastigotes stabilized in this way can undergo further manipulations, such as cell sorting, without modification of their proteome or transcriptome profiles. This methodology, which is flexible and widely applicable, should greatly benefit research into the intracellular life cycle of T. cruzi.

[PMID: 41182500] Mental health peer support is growing as an essential recovery-oriented occupation that can help alleviate the burden of mental health (MH) conditions. Despite its international growth, there is lack of cross-cultural knowledge about peer support workers' (PSW) implementation experiences. This study explored PSWs' implementation experiences of Using Peer Support In Developing Empowering Mental Health Services (UPSIDES) innovative intervention-a multi-country project designed to empower and scale-up peer support in low-, middle- and high-income countries (LMIC & HIC). Nine focus groups totaling 38 PSWs were conducted at six study sites: Ulm and Hamburg (Germany), Kampala (Uganda), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Be'er Sheva (Israel), and Pune (India). Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative analysis and MAXQDA software. Four domains were identified: (i) PSWs' experiences of recovery; (ii) PSWs' experiences of vocational development; (iii) PSWs' experiences with staff  and work-role in MH systems;and  (iv) PSWs' strive to influence broader circles. In low-and-middle-income countries specifically, PSWs experienced gains for illness management, access to care, employability and financial standing. They also engaged in active interactions with stakeholders in the community (e.g., relatives, police, etc.) promoting social-educative and anti-stigma influences. In high-income countries, experiences related to self-disclosure and peer-vocational development issues. Across sites PSWs' expressed challenges and needs related to lack of role clarity, relations with MH staff and integration into services. The findings reveal the potential of mental health peer support workers (MH PSWs) to aid in mental health recovery and systemic change.

[PMID: 41182092] Gastric cancer (GC) continues to pose a significant global health burden with persistent diagnostic challenges, especially in the detection of early-stage GC. Herein, a strand displacement reaction-mediated nucleic acid amplifier based on the spatial confinement (SC-SDR) effect as a ""booster"" is constructed to detect extracellular vesicle-derived microRNAs (EVs-miRNAs). Constraining the reactant and fuel strands in a limited space using a T-shaped DNA structure results in a significant improvement in the reaction kinetics and sensitivity because of the high local strand concentrations, ultimately enabling the detection of EVs-miRNAs at the femtomolar level. SC-SDR is conjugated onto a hydrophobic tether to aid delivery into EVs, allowing for the <i>in situ</i> detection of EVs-miRNAs. Four EVs-miRNAs act as biomarkers in combination with a random forest (RF) algorithm for use in GC diagnostics, prognostics, and early warning. In a cohort of 58 patients with GC, this diagnostic model effectively identifies 51 of the 58 cases, showing a satisfactory accuracy of 87.93%. This diagnostic efficiency outperforms that of conventional biomarkers (CEA and CA19-9), which exhibit accuracies of only 25.86% (15/58) and 17.24% (10/58), respectively. The longitudinal analysis of EVs-miRNA expression in GC patients before and after surgery and in patients with gastric intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN) reveals the dual utility of this approach as both a robust prognostic biomarker for GC progression and a promising predictive marker for GIN development. Overall, this study highlights the combined power of SC-SDR and machine learning for the analysis of EVs-miRNAs, paving the way for the clinical diagnosis and prognostication of GC.",10
Helminths interfere with immune system control of coinfections by microbial pathogens 16.,helminth infection AND immune regulation AND coinfection AND microbial pathogen,"35271673,23379442,22819588,19478853,41187352,41187220,41187217,41187189,41187180,41187178","[PMID: 35271673] Although tuft cells were discovered over 60 years ago, their functions have long been enigmatic, especially in human health. Nonetheless, tuft cells have recently emerged as key orchestrators of the host response to diverse microbial infections in the gut and airway. While tuft cells are epithelial in origin, they exhibit functions akin to immune cells and mediate important interkingdom interactions between the host and helminths, protists, viruses, and bacteria. With broad intra- and intertissue heterogeneity, tuft cells sense and respond to microbes with exquisite specificity. Tuft cells can recognize helminth and protist infection, driving a type 2 immune response to promote parasite expulsion. Tuft cells also serve as the primary physiologic target of persistent murine norovirus (MNV) and promote immune evasion. Recently, tuft cells were also shown to be infected by rotavirus. Other viral infections, such as influenza A virus, can induce tuft cell-dependent tissue repair. In the context of coinfection, tuft cells promote neurotropic flavivirus replication by dampening antiviral adaptive immune responses. Commensal and pathogenic bacteria can regulate tuft cell abundance and function and, in turn, tuft cells are implicated in modulating bacterial infiltration and mucosal barrier integrity. However, the contribution of tuft cells to microbial sensing in humans and their resulting effector responses are poorly characterized. Herein, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of microbial activation of tuft cells with an emphasis on tuft cell heterogeneity and differences between mouse and human tuft cell biology as it pertains to human health and disease.

[PMID: 23379442] Immune defences and the maintenance of immunological homeostasis in the face of pathogenic and commensal microbial exposures are channelled by innate antimicrobial pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). Whilst PRR-mediated response programmes are the result of long-term host-pathogen or host-commensal co-evolutionary dynamics involving microbes, an additional possibility is that macroparasitic co-infections may be a significant modifier of such interactions. We demonstrate experimentally that macroparasites (the model gastrointestinal nematode, Heligmosomoides) at peripheral sites of infection cause substantial alteration of the expression and function of TLRs at a systemic level (in cultured splenocytes), predominantly up-regulating TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9-mediated cytokine responses at times of high standing worm burdens. We consistently observed such effects in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice under single-pulse and trickle exposures to Heligmosomoides larvae and in SWR and CBA mice under single-pulse exposures. A complementary long-term survey of TLR2-mediated tumour necrosis factor-alpha responses in wild wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) was consistent with substantial effects of macroparasites under some environmental conditions. A general pattern, though, was for the associations of macroparasites with TLR function to be temporally dynamic and context-dependent: varying with different conditions of infection exposure in the field and laboratory and with host genetic strain in the laboratory. These results are compelling evidence that macroparasites are a major and dynamic modifier of systemic innate antimicrobial responsiveness in naturally occurring mammals and thus likely to be an important influence on the interaction between microbial exposures and the immune system.

[PMID: 22819588] Nematode infections in ruminants are a major impediment to the profitable production of meat and dairy products, especially for small farms. Gastrointestinal parasitism not only negatively impacts weight gain and milk yield, but is also a major cause of mortality in small ruminants. The current parasite control strategy involves heavy use of anthelmintics that has resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant parasite strains. This, in addition to increasing consumer demand for animal products that are free of drug residues has stimulated development of alternative strategies, including selective breeding of parasite resistant ruminants. The development of protective immunity and manifestations of resistance to nematode infections relies upon the precise expression of the host genome that is often confounded by mechanisms simultaneously required to control multiple nematode species as well as ecto- and protozoan parasites, and microbial and viral pathogens. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes represents a key step toward development of effective new parasite control strategies. Recent progress in characterizing the transcriptome of both hosts and parasites, utilizing high-throughput microarrays and RNA-seq technology, has led to the recognition of unique interactions and the identification of genes and biological pathways involved in the response to parasitism. Innovative use of the knowledge gained by these technologies should provide a basis for enhancing innate immunity while limiting the polarization of acquired immunity can negatively affect optimal responses to co-infection. Strategies for parasite control that use diet and vaccine/adjuvant combination could be evaluated by monitoring the host transcriptome for induction of appropriate mechanisms for imparting parasite resistance. Knowledge of different mechanisms of host immunity and the critical regulation of parasite development, physiology, and virulence can also selectively identify targets for parasite control. Comparative transcriptome analysis, in concert with genome-wide association (GWS) studies to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting host resistance, represents a promising molecular technology to evaluate integrated control strategies that involve breed and environmental factors that contribute to parasite resistance and improved performance. Tailoring these factors to control parasitism without severely affecting production qualities, management efficiencies, and responses to pathogenic co-infection will remain a challenge. This review summarizes recent progress and limitations of understanding regulatory genetic networks and biological pathways that affect host resistance and susceptibility to nematode infection in ruminants.

[PMID: 19478853] The nature of the immune response to infection is dependent on the type of infecting organism. Intracellular organisms such as Toxoplasma gondii stimulate a Th1-driven response associated with production of IL-12, IFN-gamma, nitric oxide and IgG2a antibodies and classical activation of macrophages. In contrast, extracellular helminths such as Fasciola hepatica induce Th2 responses characterised by the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IgG1 antibodies and alternative activation of macrophages. As co-infections with these types of parasites commonly exist in the field it is relevant to examine how the various facets of the immune responses induced by each may influence or counter-regulate that of the other. Regardless, of whether F. hepatica infection preceded or succeeded T. gondii infection, there was little impact on the production of the Th1 cytokines IL-12, IFN-gamma or on the development of classically-activated macrophages induced by T. gondii. By contrast, the production of helminth-specific Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-5, was suppressed by infection with T. gondii. Additionally, the recruitment and alternative activation of macrophages by F. hepatica was blocked or reversed by subsequent infection with T. gondii. The clinical symptoms of toxoplasmosis and the survival rate of infected mice were not significantly altered by the helminth. Despite previous studies showing that F. hepatica suppressed the classical activation of macrophages and the Th1-driven responses of mice to bystander microbial infection, as well as reduced their ability to reject these, here we found that the potent immune responses to T. gondii were capable of suppressing the responses to helminth infection. Clearly, the outcome of particular infections in polyparasitoses depends on the means and potency by which each pathogen controls the immune response.

[PMID: 41187352] Several investigations have identified volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as potential biomarkers for the detection and identification of microbial contamination of metabolically active mammalian cell cultures. In this study, we showed that emitted VOCs discriminate between uncontaminated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and those contaminated with the bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis or fungus Aspergillus Fumigatus separately, in vitro, using a methodology based on an adapted cell culture and thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). In addition, we elucidated a set of discriminatory volatile compounds from the MSC cultures and media alone across a time series experiment. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-variable importance in projection confirmed putative identifications of 18, 16, and 26 VOCs that showed relevant changes in a bacterial, fungal, and universal pathogen model, respectively, with an accuracy of 100% in the fungal model. Among these metabolites, octane, 2,5,6-trimethyl- overlapped between the three groups. Furthermore, a total of 15 VOCs were found most relevant to cell culture expansion over three days based on cluster analysis. This novel study goes a step further in identifying distinct VOC signatures of MSCs contaminated with S. epidermidis or A. fumigatus, and in monitoring MSCs proliferation over time. This pilot study shows preliminary results that indicate that VOC headspace analysis could serve as a suitable, rapid, non-invasive, and non-destructive tool for the metabolic and growth monitoring of MSCs in a dynamic cell culture bioreactor system.

[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187217] Trichuris trichiura, a soil-transmitted helminth (STH), infection is highly prevalent in children and, if not treated, can cause adverse health consequences. Microscopy using the Kato-Katz method is the mainstay of STH diagnosis in most settings but has low sensitivity. This study aims to quantify prevalence and examine risk factors of trichuriasis among children in a malaria-endemic area. The study recruited 181 children aged <5 years old from a household survey conducted in 16 villages in Timika, Papua, Indonesia, from April to July 2013. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and stool samples were analysed later using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The prevalence of T. trichiura infections was 13.8% (25/181; 95%CI, 9.1-19.7) by Kato-Katz microscopy examination and 31.5% (57/181; 95%CI, 24.8-38.8) by qPCR analysis, increasing the prevalence by 17.7% (p = 0.0001). Children aged >3 years old had a 3 times increased risk of having trichuriasis compared to younger ones (aOR 3.29 [95%CI, 1.42-7.63], p = 0.006). Children with Hb ≤ 10 g/dL were 2 times more likely to have trichuriasis compared to those with Hb > 10 g/dL, (OR 2.46 [95%CI, 1.14-5.31], p = 0.020). Malaria prevalence was 9.9% (18/181; 95%CI, 6-15.3). Coinfections with malaria increased the risk of anaemia (OR 11.7 [95%CI, 2.0-67.0], p = 0.004. No apparent association was found between trichuriasis and undernutrition (wasting and stunting). The prevalence of trichuriasis in under-five children is underestimated and together with malaria, the infections are associated with anaemia. Public health strategy should include STH prevention targeted to young children living in malaria-endemic areas.

[PMID: 41187189] With the large-scale use of antibiotics, the detection rate and mortality of carbapenem resistant Escherichia coli (CR-EC) have gradually increased. This study investigated the molecular characteristics and prevalence of CR-EC in order to supplement the isolated data of CR-EC in Hangzhou, China. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined by microbroth dilution method. The drug resistance genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. The transferability of plasmid was verified by the conjugation test and genetic homology was detected by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The whole genome was sequenced (WGS) using the Illumina MiSeq technology. A total of 8 non-duplicated CR-EC isolates were collected, and all exhibited a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Two different New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) variants, blaNDM-5 and blaNDM-13, were found with detection rates of 62.5% and 12.5%, respectively. The success rate of conjugation was 100% (6/6). Homology analysis showed that there was no widespread cloning outbreak of CR-EC, and blaNDM-5-ST410 was prevalent in the local area as a dominant group. WGS also indicated the rate of occurrence of resistance genes carrying resistance for more types of antibiotics, as well as exposed potential virulence risks. This was a survey on the prevalence and molecular characteristics of CR-EC in Hangzhou. blaNDM-like production combined with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) and/or AmpC was the main resistance mechanism of CR-EC in this area. The dominant blaNDM-5-ST410 requires enhanced attention. The horizontal transformation of plasmids, complex drug resistance, and potential virulence risks also need close attention.

[PMID: 41187180] Cystic echinococcosis is a parasitic disease recognized as a global public health problem in countries engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. In natural life cycle, ungulates are intermediate hosts: canids are definitive hosts. It could be accidentally transmitted to humans by the fecal-oral route and migrate to the liver and other visceral organs to form cystic echinococcosis. It spreads hematogenously, lymphatically, and locally. The majority of initially asymptomatic patients develop liver and lung involvement. Involvement of other organs is rare. Cystic echinococcosis is a disease diagnosed by radiologic imaging and confirmed by histopathology, serologic, and molecular tests that can be used for diagnosis and follow-up primary and secondary infections. In this case report, the involvement of multiple and rare organs of cystic echinococcosis is presented. An 82-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with an inability to urinate. A glob vesicle was detected during examination, and urine output was achieved through urinary catheterization. Imaging techniques revealed multiple cysts in the abdomen, ureter, and bladder. Urine flow in ureter orifice was obstructed by cysts. Cystectomy was performed for the intraabdominal, intravesical, and ureteral cysts. Perioperative albendazole treatment was started as adjuvant and antiparasitic treatment was completed for one month. The case was confirmed histopathologically, and no secondary infection or complication was detected in one-year follow-up. By a multidisciplinary approach, the 82-year-old patient was diagnosed with Cystic echinococcosis, with a rare and multi-organ involvement, given the high risk of infection due to the environmental contamination in this country.

[PMID: 41187178] The hospital environment is an important source of nosocomial infections. Surfaces in the hospital facilities may be considered as microbial reservoirs that can cause patient contamination. This study aimed to evaluate the microbiological quality of surfaces and equipment in the Mohammed V Hospital, located in Al-Hoceima, Morocco. A total of 360 samples of surfaces were collected by swabbing from 5 service departments (intensive care unit (ICU), maternity, neonatology, operating room, and pediatric) over a period of 1 year (January-December 2021). The samples were analyzed at the provincial public health laboratory of Al-Hoceima. Isolation and identification of bacteria were performed according to conventional bacteriology methods. The results indicated that 34.4% (124/360) samples were contaminated. The ICU was the most contaminated service and the frequency of contaminated samples was 50%. The most contaminated sampling sites were soap for hand washing (27.4%), trolleys (25.8%), and sinks (22.6%). Gram-positive bacteria represented 51.6% of the contaminants. The most isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.5%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.4%). Extended spectrum beta lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae represented 31.7% of the contaminants. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 17.6% of the contaminants. This study provided important data that can guide the nosocomial infection control committee to manage the risks related to contaminated hospital surfaces through the establishment of an adequate risk analysis strategy.",10

This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of forced immigration-related family separation on the association between traditional adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) among Latinx immigrant youth from the Northern Triangle (NT; El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Primary surveys assessing forced immigration-related family separation, ACEs, and mental health were administered to a sample of NT immigrant youth (N = 172). Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the study aim. In main effects analysis, forced immigration-related family separation was significantly associated with depression (B = 2.11, CI = [0.11, 4.11], p = .039) and PTSD (B = 4.01, CI = [0.63, 7.40], p = .021) symptoms. ACEs were significantly associated with depression (B = 1.34, CI = [0.86, 1.81], p < .001), anxiety (B = 1.05, CI = [0.63, 1.47], p < .001), and PTSD (B = 2.17, CI = [1.37, 2.97], p < .001) symptoms. In moderation effects analysis, the association of ACEs on depression (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.18, -0.25], p = .014), anxiety (B = -1.00, CI = [-1.86, -0.13], p = .024), and PTSD (B = -2.23, CI = [-3.84, -0.62], p = .007) symptoms was significantly attenuated among youth who experienced forced immigration-related family separation. Study findings may underscore the need to consider the inclusivity of immigration-related trauma in ACE assessment tools.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187339] Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is a common endemic vector-borne disease in Asia that can lead to a range of systemic complications, including the rare but potentially life-threatening manifestation of acute pancreatitis. We conducted a systematic review of all reported cases of scrub typhus-associated acute pancreatitis from 1943 to 2024 using PubMed, including English, Japanese, and Chinese literature, and analyzed a total of 14 cases, including one newly identified case at our institution. Diagnostic criteria were based on compatible clinical features, elevated pancreatic enzymes, and characteristic imaging findings. The median age of patients was 47 years (range 22-75), with 69.2% of patients being male. The most frequent clinical manifestations were fever (100%), abdominal pain (92.3%), and thrombocytopenia (30.8%). Over one-third of the patients developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or shock, and the mortality rate was 23.1%, with all fatalities occurring in patients with MODS. Most patients received doxycycline or azithromycin along with supportive care. The newly reported case presented with rapidly progressive pancreatitis requiring intensive care and multiple organ support, but the patient eventually recovered. These findings highlight that acute pancreatitis is an underrecognized yet severe complication of scrub typhus, often associated with poor outcomes when MODS is present. Clinicians in endemic regions should consider pancreatitis in the differential diagnoses when evaluating scrub typhus patients with abdominal symptoms or systemic inflammation. Prompt recognition and timely, aggressive management may improve survival and reduce complications in affected patients.

[PMID: 41187302] Major adverse cardiovascular events resulting from atherosclerotic plaque instability account for a plurality of deaths worldwide despite the use of highly effective lipid lowering therapies. Over the last three decades, the role of inflammation in atherogenesis has been tested extensively. Although preclinical studies demonstrate a clear role for inflammation in atherogenesis, clinical studies using global anti-inflammatory therapies have not been as successful as hoped, encouraging the search for new therapeutic strategies. Thanks to the advent of cell-specific lineage tracing, we have begun to appreciate the multifaceted role of smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching in modulating plaque stability. Here, we review the mechanisms controlling smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching during early and late-stage pathogenesis, which may inspire future therapies to stabilize plaques.

[PMID: 41187293] Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fatal disease. Current clinically approved treatments slow disease progression but are not curative. Thus, there is a critical need to better define the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF and develop novel approaches to treat this devastating lung condition. Immune dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, accompanied by fibrosis, constitutes a key hallmark of IPF. IPF is generally considered to be a fibroproliferative disorder rather than an immune condition because, historically, immunomodulatory therapies have failed to produce significant clinical effect. This lack of response is frustrating given that there is evidence of immune dysfunction in IPF and highlights the need to clarify the role of immune cells and inflammatory pathways in IPF. There is increasing evidence that the extracellular matrix (ECM) directs cell fate and function, and we propose that ECM remodeling and immune dysfunction in IPF generate a self-perpetuating fibrotic circuit that is refractory to classical anti-inflammatory agents. Understanding the relationship between ECM and immune dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis could help identify novel therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187245] Identifying the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a cornerstone of preventive medical care. Despite its significance, limited research has explored ASCVD risk in individuals with fibrotic skin diseases. This study aims to evaluate the risk of ASCVD in patients diagnosed with fibrotic skin conditions. We utilized the TriNetX platform to analyze ASCVD risk associated with fibrotic skin conditions. Propensity score-matched (PSM) cohorts were constructed to adjust for confounding. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Patients with fibrotic skin diseases demonstrated an elevated risk of ASCVD. Scleroderma was most strongly associated with ASCVD risk (HR 2.51 [95% CI: 1.97,3.21]), followed by hypertrophic scar (HR 1.40 [95% CI: 1.20,1.63]). Elevated risks were also observed for morphea (HR 1.36 [95% CI: 1.03,1.08]) and lichen sclerosis (HR 1.30 [95% CI: 1.04,1.62]). Individuals with fibrotic skin conditions, including scleroderma, hypertrophic scars, morphea, and lichen sclerosis, demonstrate an increased risk of ASCVD. These findings highlight the significance of recognizing fibrotic skin diseases as possible indicators of systemic inflammation.

[PMID: 41187240] Nicotinamide (niacinamide) is the water-soluble form of vitamin B3. Nicotinamide plays a crucial physiological role as a catalyst for various molecular reactions in the body and is a common over-the-counter supplement. In dermatology, oral nicotinamide has a long history of diverse applications. Oral nicotinamide mitigates ultraviolet-induced immunosuppression, serves as adjunctive therapy for blistering skin disorders, reduces inflammation and sebum in acne vulgaris, and has been used for pruritic disorders. Recent studies indicate that terminal metabolites of nicotinamide may contribute to vascular inflammation and elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly at doses exceeding therapeutic recommendations of 500 mg. Given the wide range of applications of nicotinamide in dermatology, we aim to investigate the effects of oral nicotinamide on cardiovascular health. A review of the literature was conducted to assess the dermatological benefits of oral nicotinamide as well as its potential cardiovascular risks, particularly at high doses. Evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses was evaluated to synthesize current knowledge on its safety and efficacy. Oral nicotinamide has demonstrated significant benefits in dermatological practice, including reducing the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers in immunocompetent individuals and improving outcomes in various inflammatory skin conditions. However, recent evidence suggests that increased serum levels of nicotinamide's terminal metabolites N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide leads to increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular effects. While oral nicotinamide remains a valuable option in dermatological practice, clinicians should exercise caution in prescribing this at high doses due to the potential cardiovascular risks.",10

This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of forced immigration-related family separation on the association between traditional adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) among Latinx immigrant youth from the Northern Triangle (NT; El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Primary surveys assessing forced immigration-related family separation, ACEs, and mental health were administered to a sample of NT immigrant youth (N = 172). Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the study aim. In main effects analysis, forced immigration-related family separation was significantly associated with depression (B = 2.11, CI = [0.11, 4.11], p = .039) and PTSD (B = 4.01, CI = [0.63, 7.40], p = .021) symptoms. ACEs were significantly associated with depression (B = 1.34, CI = [0.86, 1.81], p < .001), anxiety (B = 1.05, CI = [0.63, 1.47], p < .001), and PTSD (B = 2.17, CI = [1.37, 2.97], p < .001) symptoms. In moderation effects analysis, the association of ACEs on depression (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.18, -0.25], p = .014), anxiety (B = -1.00, CI = [-1.86, -0.13], p = .024), and PTSD (B = -2.23, CI = [-3.84, -0.62], p = .007) symptoms was significantly attenuated among youth who experienced forced immigration-related family separation. Study findings may underscore the need to consider the inclusivity of immigration-related trauma in ACE assessment tools.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187380] Mutations of the Ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene are generally associated with syndromic tooth agenesis, yet their influence on non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) has not been thoroughly elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of NSTA and to identify pathogenic EDA mutations in two Chinese families using whole-exome sequencing, and explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Two unrelated individuals with NSTA and their families were enrolled in this study, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Whole-exome sequencing was performed, followed by variants detection and filtering to identify pathogenic genes and mutations. The identified genetic mutations were further validated by Sanger sequencing and confirmed to be absent in 300 unrelated healthy individuals. Conservation analysis, three-dimensional (3D) modeling, and electrostatic potential calculations were conducted accordingly. We identified a novel mutation c.827 G>T (p.Arg276Leu) and a previously reported mutation c.1069 C>T (p.Arg357Trp) in the EDA gene, with the latter showing previously unreported phenotypic characteristics. Both mutations are located in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) domain of EDA, which is crucial for binding with ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR). Conservation analysis indicated that these mutations are evolutionarily conserved across various species. In silico predictions and 3D modeling analyses suggested that these mutations may be pathogenic, potentially due to alterations in the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic potential, thereby affecting EDA-EDAR interaction. Our findings broaden the mutation spectrum of EDA gene associated with NSTA by identifying a novel mutation and provide a basis for future genetic counseling.

[PMID: 41187375] To compare cost-effectiveness of targeted therapeutic strategies for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHB) patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage endometrial cancer. A Markov-based cost-utility model using a third-party payer perspective compared concurrent and maintenance treatment strategies incorporating dostarlimab and trastuzumab for newly diagnosed stage III-IV endometrial cancer: chemotherapy alone; 3 universal immunotherapy strategies (universal concurrent and maintenance dostarlimab +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu-positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas); and 3 targeted immunotherapy strategies (dostarlimab for mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas). Costs (2024 USD), utilities, and clinical estimates were derived from published literature and the National Cancer Database. The base case analysis was a microsimulation with 10,000 runs, accompanied by a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 20,000 trials. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We performed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses on key parameters and analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. All targeted immunotherapy strategies were cost-effective compared to chemotherapy alone in both NHB and NHW, while universal immunotherapy was never cost-effective. Targeted strategies were more cost-effective in NHB than NHW. Targeted dostarlimab for dMMR plus trastuzumab for HER2 serous and carcinosarcomas was the most cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy, with an ICER of $119,945/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, assuming longer durations of treatment benefit resulted in lower ICERs. Personalized treatment strategies incorporating HER2 and MMR testing should be considered to optimize both cost-effectiveness and equity in care.

[PMID: 41187374] The aim of this umbrella review was to synthesise existing evidence from systematic reviews on the impact of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on recovery in intensive care units. This umbrella review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidance, and its reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews statement. The search was carried out in the databases Medline®, CINAHL®, Scopus®, SciELO®, Web of Science®, Cochrane®, and SportDiscus®, using both indexed terms specific to each database and free-text terms. To assess the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews, the AMSTAR 2, tool was usedcovering 16 domains related to review design and reporting quality. The search was conducted with no temporal limits, until December 2024. A total of 21 systematic reviews were included. The most frequently assessed outcomes were muscle strength, muscle mass, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Muscle strength was the most extensively investigated outcome, with 11 reviews reporting positive effects. The analysis of primary study overlap revealed a moderate degree of overlap (6.71%). It is concluded that neuromuscular electrical stimulation is safe for critically ill patients, with positive effects on muscle strength, muscle mass, and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Although neuromuscular electrical stimulation demonstrates promising results in the rehabilitation of critically ill patients, the methodological quality of the available systematic reviews is variable. Therefore, there is a need for more robust and high-quality systematic reviews to strengthen the evidence base.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187366] The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, primarily through mechanisms involving carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Aberrant FGFR1 signalling has been implicated in various cancers, including lung, breast, neck and urothelial carcinoma. Despite the recognized oncogenic potential of FGFR1, therapeutic strategies targeting its kinase domain remain inadequately explored. This underscores an urgent need for the development of novel FGFR1 inhibitors, particularly through de novo drug design approaches, to effectively counteract FGFR1-driven malignancies. This research aims to develop novel FGFR1 inhibitors through a multi-step approach involving fragment-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and density functional theory studies (DFT), with the goal of targeting FGFR1's kinase binding domain to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Initially, known FGFR inhibitor molecules were retrieved and subjected to fragment-based drug designing and virtual screening. Through thorough analysis, molecules containing the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold were identified as promising candidates. A pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based database containing 90,952 molecules was subsequently retrieved from PubChem and filtered using molecular docking-based virtual screening resulting 94 molecules having better binding affinity than derazantinib, reference drug. After pharmacokinetic profiling (ADME), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) studies, out of 94 molecules only 11 compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and superior MM-GBSA binding free energies were selected. Docking-based screening revealed that selected 11 compounds demonstrated better binding scores than the reference drug, derazantinib. Among them, HIT1, was selected for 150ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess its conformational stability. DFT calculations further confirmed its bio-feasibility by analyzing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Overall, the selected lead compounds exhibited enhanced binding affinity, superior conformational stability, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to derazantinib. Present findings suggest that the identified hit molecules hold strong potential for inhibiting FGFR1's kinase domain and disrupting FGFR-associated tumor angiogenesis.

[PMID: 41187364] Threat perception is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, shaped by evolutionary pressures and modern environmental demands. While ancestral threats (e.g., snakes) have been shown to elicit stronger neural responses than modern threats (e.g., guns), less is known about how the brain processes airborne threats, such as depictions of individuals wearing face masks. This fMRI study investigates neural responses to ancestral, modern, and airborne threats to identify shared and distinct activation patterns. Sixty participants viewed visual stimuli from the three categories while undergoing fMRI scanning. Results showed heightened activation in the fear-processing network for all affective stimuli. In addition, activation of the ventral attention network was found for the ancestral threats. Modern threats elicited less intense responses, primarily engaging cortical regions associated with context-specific analysis. Notably, airborne threats elicited neural responses of similar intensity to ancestral threats but activated cortical regions overlapping with those for modern threats. This dual pattern highlights the brain's capacity to integrate evolutionary biases with socially constructed threat awareness. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing airborne threats as a unique category of threat processing, with implications for public health and mental well-being.

[PMID: 41187363] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains a major respiratory pathogen of economic concern in the poultry industry. This study investigated the farm-level prevalence of IBV and evaluated associated risk factors in northern Vietnam by a cross-sectional study from June 2022 to June 2024. A total of 69 poultry farms were randomly selected across nine provinces, and pooled tracheal swab samples were purposively collected for IBV detection using RT-qPCR. The overall IBV farm-level prevalence was 34.78 % (95 % CI:23.71-47.21 %). Although no statistically significant differences were found across provinces, production types, age groups, or flock sizes, IBV was detected in all subgroups, indicating widespread circulation of the virus. A total of 22 potential risk factors were initially assessed using univariate logistic regression. Of these, six variables with P < 0.1, including farm size, number of poultry houses, presence of multiple age groups, vaccination at day-old, frequency of disinfection before chick placement, and proximity to live bird markets and residential areas, were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model retained two independent predictors: performing more than one disinfection before chick placement (P = 0.035), and administration of a live IB vaccine at one day of age (P = 0.006), both of which were significantly associated with reduced the odds of IBV infection at the farm level. These findings suggest that strategic vaccination and careful calibration of disinfection protocols are critical to minimizing IBV transmission at the farm level.

[PMID: 41187362] The risk of a foreign animal disease coming into the United States and threatening the swine industry necessitates the need for enhanced biosecurity plans to mitigate risks to premises. Although most biosecurity information is aimed and created for larger producers and isn't appropriate for smaller producers, such as swine exhibitors. Swine exhibitors are a niche group who raise swine differently than large producers and travel extensively with their animals. This study sought out to; develop a SPS plan template adapted from the SPS framework that would be suitable for swine exhibitors' biosecurity features; describe basic demographics and existence of biosecurity plan (and their features) for the target population; and investigate the association between having a previous biosecurity plan on site and demographic factors (number of pigs, type of housing, presence of other animal species in the premise and geographical region) as well as potential exposure to feral swine under their current housing conditions. These objectives were accomplished by attending twelve swine exhibitions within a year and a half to assist 161 individuals in the creation of personalized biosecurity plans for their premises, while obtaining additional study data. This study found no significant relationship between demographic factors and previously having a biosecurity plan, but that only 31.8 % of participants had previous biosecurity plans on their premise. However, swine exhibitors with existing biosecurity plans had more than 3-fold higher odds of acknowledging housing conditions with potential of feral swine contact compared to swine exhibitors without preexisting biosecurity plans. These findings indicate the need for additional efforts to assist swine exhibitors in creating biosecurity plans at shows across the United States.",10

Recent evidence has linked butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1) to immune dysregulation. This study was to elucidate the relationship of BTN3A1 in SLE. Expression of BTN3A1 in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SLE patients and healthy controls explored the association between BTN3A1 and SLE. We found that BTN3A1 mRNA, plasma levels, and expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly elevated in SLE patients. In BTN3A1 gene knock-in (BTN3A1<sup>KI</sup>) mice, inflammation and lupus-like manifestations occurred, including increased proportions of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, decreased Treg cells, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and anti-dsDNA antibodies, renal injury, and suppressed IL-38 serum levels. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-38 in pristane-treated BTN3A1<sup>KI</sup> mice notably alleviated these pathological changes. Mechanistic investigations revealed that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the ferroptosis pathway were closely associated with the effects mediated by the BTN3A1-IL-38 axis. In vitro experiments showed that IL-38 stimulation reduced proliferation, apoptosis, and decreased the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins, Fe<sup>2</sup>⁺, glutathione, and malondialdehyde in CD4<sup>+</sup>BTN3A1<sup>+/+</sup> T and BTN3A1<sup>+/+</sup> Jurkat T cells. Overall, BTN3A1 plays a crucial role in SLE pathogenesis by regulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function.

[PMID: 40448313] This study aimed to investigate the role of T-cell imbalance in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the role of Ubiquitin-binding enzyme 2N (UBC13) in the treatment of SLE. Mice in the model group were intraperitoneally injected with normal saline. The UBC13 group was administered UBC13 recombinant protein, and the dexamethasone (DXM) group was treated with DXM for 8 weeks. Serum anti-dsDNA and ANA levels were quantified via ELISA. Histopathological changes were analyzed using H&E staining. Splenic mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Flow cytometry was used characterize Th1, Th2 and Treg cells populations, while western blotting was used to detect STAT3 and NF-κB signalling pathway-related proteins in thymic lysates. UBC13 administration ameliorated splenic hyperplasia and attenuated tissue damage in MRL/lpr mice, accompanied by a reduction in serum anti-dsDNA and ANA titers. Proinflammatory cytokine production, was suppressed following UBC13 intervention. Concurrently, UBC13 restored Th1/Th2 cell equilibrium and enhanced Treg cell suppressive function. Mechanistically, UBC13 inhibited NF-κB pathway activation and suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation. UBC13 restores the homeostasis and function of Th1/Th2 and Treg cell through suppression of STAT3 and the NF-κB signaling pathway activation, thereby mitigating SLE-induced organ damage.

[PMID: 36867923] Despite advances in general and targeted immunosuppressive therapies, limiting all mainstay treatment options in refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cases has necessitated the development of new therapeutic strategies. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged with unique properties, including a solid propensity to reduce inflammation, exert immunomodulatory effects, and repair injured tissues. An animal model of acquired SLE mice was induced via intraperitoneal immunization with Pristane and affirmed by measuring specific biomarkers. Bone marrow (BM) MSCs were isolated from healthy BALB/c mice and cultured in vitro, then were identified and confirmed by flow cytometry and cytodifferentiation. Systemic MSCs transplantation was performed and then several parameters were analyzed and compared, including specific cytokines (IL-17, IL-4, IFN-ɣ, TGF-β) at the serum level, the percentage of Th cell subsets (Treg/Th17, Th1/Th2) in splenocytes, and also the relief of lupus nephritis, respectively by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry analysis and by hematoxylin & eosin staining and also immunofluorescence assessment. Experiments were carried out with different initiation treatment time points (early and late stages of disease). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Tukey's test was used for multiple comparisons. The rate of proteinuria, anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, and serum creatinine levels decreased with BM-MSCs transplantation. These results were associated with attenuated lupus renal pathology in terms of reducing IgG and C3 deposition and lymphocyte infiltration. Our findings suggested that TGF-β (associated with lupus microenvironment) can contribute to MSC-based immunotherapy by modulating the population of TCD4<sup>+</sup> cell subsets. Obtained results indicated that MSCs-based cytotherapy could negatively affect the progression of induced SLE by recovering the function of Treg cells, suppressing Th1, Th2, and Th17 lymphocyte function, and downregulating their pro-inflammatory cytokines. MSC-based immunotherapy showed a delayed effect on the progression of acquired SLE in a lupus microenvironment-dependent manner. Allogenic MSCs transplantation revealed the ability to re-establish the balance of Th17/Treg, Th1/Th2 and restore the plasma cytokines network in a pattern dependent on disease conditions. The conflicting results of early versus advanced therapy suggest that MSCs may produce different effects depending on when they are administered and their activation status.

[PMID: 34576124] Asthma is an allergic disease that causes severe infiltration of leukocytes into the lungs. Leukocyte infiltration is mediated by the binding of sialyl Lewis X (sLe<sup>x</sup>) glycans present on the leukocytes to E-and P-selectins present on the endothelial cells at the sites of inflammation. Here, we found that mouse eosinophils express sLe<sup>x</sup> glycans, and their infiltration into the lungs and proliferation in the bone marrow were significantly suppressed by an anti-sLe<sup>x</sup> monoclonal antibody (mAb) F2 in a murine model of ovalbumin-induced asthma. The percentage of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bone marrow and serum IgE levels decreased significantly in the F2-administered mice. Levels of T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines and chemokines, involved in IgE class switching and eosinophil proliferation and recruitment, were also decreased in the F2-administered mice. An ex vivo cell rolling assay revealed that sLe<sup>x</sup> glycans mediate the rolling of mouse eosinophils on P-selectin-expressing cells. These results indicate that the mAb F2 exerts therapeutic effects in a murine model of allergen-induced asthma, suggesting that sLe<sup>x</sup> carbohydrate antigen could serve as a novel therapeutic target for allergic asthma.

[PMID: 33006813] Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease with no absolute cure. Although the exact etiopathogenesis of SLE is still enigmatic, it has been well demonstrated that a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors trigger a disturbance in immune responses and thereby participate in the development of this condition. Almost all available therapeutic strategies in SLE are primarily based on the administration of immunosuppressive drugs and are not curative. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a subset of non-hematopoietic adult stem cells that can be isolated from many adult tissues and are increasingly recognized as immune response modulating agents. MSC-mediated inhibition of immune responses is a complex mechanism that involves almost every aspect of the immune response. MSCs suppress the maturation of antigen-presenting cells (DC and MQ), proliferation of T cells (Th1, T17, and Th2), proliferation and immunoglobulin production of B cells, the cytotoxic activity of CTL and NK cells in addition to increasing regulatory cytokines (TGF-β and IL10), and decreasing inflammatory cytokines (IL17, INF-ϒ, TNF-α, and IL12) levels. MSCs have shown encouraging results in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases, in particular SLE. This report aims to review the beneficial and therapeutic properties of MSCs; it also focuses on the results of animal model studies, preclinical studies, and clinical trials of MSC therapy in SLE from the immunoregulatory aspect.

[PMID: 32582209] Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5) is one of nine members of the IRF family of transcription factors. Although initially discovered as a key regulator of the type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine arm of the innate immune response, IRF5 has now been found to also mediate pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, metabolic homeostasis and tumor suppression. Hyperactivation of IRF5 has been implicated in numerous autoimmune diseases, chief among them systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease in which patients often share similar characteristics in terms of autoantibody production and strong genetic risk factors, yet also possess unique disease signatures. <i>IRF5</i> pathogenic alleles contribute one of the strongest risk factors for SLE disease development. Multiple models of murine lupus have shown that loss of <i>Irf5</i> is protective against disease development. In an attempt to elucidate the regulatory role(s) of IRF5 in driving SLE pathogenesis, labs have begun to examine the function of IRF5 in several immune cell types, including B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. A somewhat untouched area of research on IRF5 is in T cells, even though <i>Irf5</i> knockout mice were reported to have skewing of T cell subsets from T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) toward T helper 2 (Th2), indicating a potential role for IRF5 in T cell regulation. However, most studies attributed this T cell phenotype in <i>Irf5</i> knockout mice to dysregulation of antigen presenting cell function rather than an intrinsic role for IRF5 in T cells. In this review, we offer a different interpretation of the literature. The role of IRF5 in T cells, specifically its control of T cell effector polarization and the resultant T cell-mediated cytokine production, has yet to be elucidated. A strong understanding of the regulatory role(s) of this key transcription factor in T cells is necessary for us to grasp the full picture of the complex pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like SLE.

[PMID: 31766607] Several allergic and immunologic diseases including asthma, food allergy (FA), chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), atopic dermatitis (AD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Behçet's disease (BD) are characterized by the involvement of Th2 immunity. Several mediators lead to immunoglobulin (Ig)E production, thus including key cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Among them, IL-31 and IL-33 have been recently studied as novel biomarkers and future therapeutic targets for allergic and immunological disorders. IL-31 is a proinflammatory cytokine-it regulates cell proliferation and is involved in tissue remodeling. IL-33, acting through its receptor suppression of tumorigenity (ST2L), is an alarmin cytokine from the IL-1 family, whose expression is mediated by tissue damage. The latter has a pleiotropic effect, as it may modulate specific and innate immune cells functions. To date, several researchers have investigated the involvement of IL-31 and IL-33 in several allergic and immune-mediated diseases. Further studies are needed to understand the future applications of these molecules as novel therapeutic agents. This paper aims to give the readers a complete and updated review of IL-31 and IL-33 involvement among the most common autoimmune and allergic disorders.

[PMID: 31394431] Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS)-interacting multifunctional protein 1 (AIMP1) enhances the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In our previous study, we have shown that serum AIMP1 in patients with SLE was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. To address whether neutralization of AIMP1 could ameliorate nephritis in lupus-prone mice, we generated atializumab, a humanized antibody against AIMP1 and investigated its therapeutic efficacy. ELISA showed that serum AIMP1 at 23 weeks old was significantly higher than that at 13 weeks old in lupus-prone mice. Therefore, lupus-prone mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups (vehicle, methylprednisolone and 0.5, 2, and 5 mg/kg atializumab). After treatment, disease severity was assessed using a variety of phenotypes, including proteinuria, histological damages, renal deposition of immune-complex. In addition, serum cytokines, anti-dsDNA and IgG subclasses were determined. T cell subsets were analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Atializumab significantly diminished proteinuria, improved glomerular and tubular damages and reduced the renal deposition of immune-complexes. Moreover, atializumab significantly decreased serum interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-17A, and IL-6, whereas it increased serum IL-10. Similarly, atializumab reduced the numbers of T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2 and T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in a dose-dependent manner, while atializumab enhanced the number of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Furthermore, atializumab decreased not only splenic plasma cells and serum anti-dsDNA but also pathogenic IgG subclasses for nephritis. It suppressed NF-κB activation by inhibiting IκBα degradation in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Atializumab alleviated nephritis by inhibiting autoreactive T, B, and plasma cells and decreasing NF-κB-related proinflammatory cytokines in lupus-prone mice. These results suggest that treatment targeting AIMP1 could be a novel and highly immune-modulating therapeutic strategy in lupus nephritis.

[PMID: 30894863] <b>Introduction:</b> The role of the immune response in the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) remains elusive. It is possible that differences in the frequencies of Th17 cells and/or defects in the immunoregulatory mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of APS. Our aim was to determine the peripheral blood Th cells phenotype and the circulating cytokine profile in patients with primary APS (pAPS) and compare it with systemic lupus erythemathosus (SLE) as disease control group. <b>Methods:</b> The frequencies of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) were determined in PBMCs from 36 patients with pAPS by flow cytometry. As control groups we included 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) and 11 patients with SLE. The suppressive capacity of Tregs was evaluated <i>in vitro</i> by coculture assay. On the other hand, intracellular cytokine production was assessed in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and circulating IL-6, IL-10, and IL-35 were measured by Cytometric Bead Array and ELISA. The quantification of Th master gene expression levels was performed by real time quantitative PCR. <b>Results:</b> pAPS patients and SLE patients did not show differences in the percentage or number of Tregs compared to HC. The suppressive capacity of Tregs was also similar in the three study group. Instead, we found higher FoxP3·mRNA expression levels in pAPS patients and HC than SLE patients. Regarding the Th17 response, patients with pAPS and HC showed a significantly lower frequency of circulating Th17 cells than SLE. However, no differences were observed in the Th1 response between patients and controls. Thus, increased Th17/Th1 and Th17/Treg ratios were found in SLE patients but not in pAPS patients. pAPS and SLE patients had higher serum IL-6 levels than HC but there was not difference between both disease groups. Besides, a significant increase in the immunosuppressive cytokine levels was observed only in pAPS as compared to HC. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our data demonstrate an increased inflammatory profile of peripheral blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from SLE as compared with pAPS mostly due to an increased Th17 response. In conclusion, there seems not to be a direct pathogenic role for Th cells in pAPS but in SLE.

[PMID: 30470828] Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystemic autoimmune disease with an unknown etiology. Recently, it has been elucidated that dysregulated histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity is related to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors are effective for the treatment of allergy, cancer, and autoimmune diseases, but they have several adverse side effects. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a novel HDAC 6-specific inhibitor, CKD-506, in a murine SLE model. CKD-506 significantly improved survival rate and significantly decreased the incidence of severe proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen, kidney inflammation, and glomerular infiltration of IgG and C3. In addition, CKD 506 reduced the proportions of CD138<sup>+</sup> plasma cells, CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> T cells, and CD25<sup>+</sup> cells and the Th1/Th2 ratio in the spleen. CKD-506 significantly reduced inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-inducible protein (IP-10) and significantly increased TGF-β in serum. CKD-506 also significantly reduced IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, and CCL4 levels in kidney. CKD-506 decreased the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the serum and kidneys, resulting in inhibition of cell migration and suppression of lupus nephritis without adverse effects.",10

However, the predictive value of AMH for the occurrence of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy has limits. We reported a patient with extreme low AMH achieved spontaneous conception three times. A 35-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, with a history of one miscarriage, presented with a one-year history of secondary infertility seeking reproductive assistance. Laboratory evaluation showed negligible (0.072 ng/mL or 0.514 pmol/L) AMH levels and ultrasound revealed reduced bilateral antral follicle count (AFC). She was diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and counseled about her limited fertility prognosis. Despite recommendations for assisted reproductive techniques (ART), the patient pursued spontaneous conception. Two natural cycles and two ovulation induction cycles were conducted, utilizing recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with ovulation triggered by 8,000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Remarkably, the patient successfully conceived three pregnancies and delivered four healthy children. In April 2022, she gave birth to a healthy boy weighing 3.17 kg via spontaneous vaginal delivery. In August 2023, she delivered another healthy boy weighing 3.80 kg via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Subsequently, in November 2024, she delivered healthy twins-one boy and one girl-via spontaneous vaginal delivery. This case underscores the clinical significance of specialized reproductive medicine intervention in achieving successful pregnancy outcomes in patients with rapidly declining and persistently low AMH levels. It highlights that even in cases of severely diminished ovarian reserve, natural conception is possible with expert guidance. Clinicians should exercise prudence when providing prognostic guidance regarding fertility among patients presenting with markedly diminished or undetectable AMH concentrations. The application of AMH measurement for fertility assessment in the general population still need to be clarified in well-designed prospective studies. Not applicable.

[PMID: 25336704] Ovarian reserve (OR) screening of the general population is generally not advocated as it has not been conclusively established to reflect immediate potential for natural conception, while it may also potentially create anxiety for women. However, in this paper, we argue in support of screening of the general population for diminished OR. First, OR tests such as measurements of anti-Müllerian hormone and antral follicle count are predictive of the chances of IVF conception, and therefore predict a woman's total fertility potential (i.e. chances of natural and IVF-related conceptions). Since the requirement for assisted conception increases with age, this is an important point. Secondly, women identified as having low OR are at increased risk of early loss of fertility potential in the longer term, limiting their reproductive life span and the size of their family if they delay conception. Thirdly, women often disregard generic advice to avoid delaying conception beyond 30 years of age, yet studies suggest that personalized risk assessment tools such as OR testing can actually increase an individual's motivation for positive change. A poor OR screening test result is more likely to convince a woman to bring forward her plans for natural conception, or alternatively explore oocyte vitrification, at a stage when these approaches still have reasonable prospects of success. Finally, we believe that women have a right, based on the ethical concept of autonomy, to be made aware of OR screening, so that they themselves can determine if OR testing is useful in assisting them with reproductive life planning.

[PMID: 23171685] High serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels have been associated with diminished ovarian reserve; however, the association between high urinary FSH and reduced natural fertility has yet to be established. We sought to characterize the relationship between a single or multiple measurements of early follicular phase urinary FSH and fertility. Women (n = 209), 30 to 44 years old with no history of infertility, who had been trying to conceive for less than 3 months, provided early follicular phase urine. Participants subsequently kept a diary to record bleeding and intercourse and conducted standardized pregnancy testing for up to 6 months. A subset of women (N = 95) collected urine on cycle day 3 for up to 6 cycles. Urine was analyzed for FSH and creatinine (cr) corrected. Proportional hazard models were used to calculate fecundability ratios (FRs). Urinary FSH levels across cycles from the same woman were highly correlated (adjusted intraclass correlation = .77); within-woman variance was 3-fold lower than variance among women. Women with an initial urinary FSH level <7 mIU/mg cr exhibited a nonsignificant reduction in the probability of pregnancy (adjusted FR 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-1.13), as did women with elevated urinary FSH (≥12 mIU/mg cr; adjusted FR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.46-1.32). Using the most recent or maximum urinary FSH value did not strengthen the association. In the general population, urinary FSH levels appear to be nonlinearly associated with fertility; however, broad CIs indicate a lack of statistical significance. Repetitive testing appears to be of little benefit.

[PMID: 9619346] Tests for diminished ovarian reserve provide valuable prognostic information for women considering assisted reproductive technology. The best characterized screening tool for a general infertility patient is the clomiphene citrate challenge test. These screening tests do not have absolute sensitivity or specificity. Additionally, the predictive value of these tests can be low if used in a population at low risk. Patients with abnormal testing should be counselled that their chances of conception with assisted reproductive technology are poor. This may impact on the choice of aggressive treatment; however, the results of these tests should never be used to exclude patients from care.

[PMID: 8377979] To assess the results of screening an unselected general infertility population for diminished ovarian reserve with the clomiphene citrate challenge test. Two hundred thirty-six couples were followed prospectively and studied for the relationship between clomiphene citrate challenge test screening and final diagnoses and long-term fertility rates. Abnormal clomiphene citrate challenge tests were found in two of 61 (3%) of the patients younger than 30 years, in five of 72 (7%) aged 30-34, in seven of 68 (10%) aged 35-39, and in nine of 35 (26%) aged 40 or older. An abnormal test predicted lower pregnancy rates; conception occurred in 92 of 213 (43%) of patients with normal results, but only two of 23 (9%) of patients with abnormal results (P < .004). Unexplained infertility (not considering the clomiphene citrate challenge test) was a common finding in patients with abnormal clomiphene citrate challenge test results (12 of 23). This incidence was significantly higher than that in patients with normal clomiphene citrate challenge test results (20 of 213) (P < .001). Approximately 10% of the patients in the general infertility population had abnormal clomiphene citrate challenge tests. The incidence of abnormal results increases with age beginning in the early 30s, occurs with a higher frequency in patients who would otherwise be diagnosed with unexplained infertility, and prognosticates decreased long-term pregnancy rates.

[PMID: 41187330] Oral health is essential for children's overall well-being, yet dental caries remain a significant global health issue. Gamification has gained attention as an innovative approach to improving children's oral health by enhancing engagement and promoting behavior change. Although previous studies have examined different aspects of gamification in pediatric oral health, no review has addressed it as a comprehensive framework encompassing education, behavior change, engagement, and digital platforms. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in pediatric oral health management, focusing on game design elements; intervention platforms; and outcomes such as oral hygiene knowledge, behavior, and engagement. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO), identifying studies from January 1, 2014, to February 9, 2025. The review included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and qualitative studies with measurable outcomes that focused on gamified interventions for children's oral health. A standardized form was used to collect study details, interventions, demographics, outcomes, and risk of bias. Data synthesis was conducted using a narrative approach due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. The synthesis focused on identifying common themes, evaluating intervention effectiveness, and highlighting methodological strengths and limitations. In total, 41 studies were reviewed, and most (n=24, 59%) used digital interventions such as mobile apps, serious games, and augmented reality. Game elements such as rewards, progress tracking, and interactive feedback were commonly used to enhance user engagement and improve health outcomes. The effect of the digital-based interventions was generally positive, with 38% (9/24) of the studies reporting improvements in oral health knowledge and behaviors. In nonexperimental studies, gamified interventions demonstrated substantial improvements in parental engagement and awareness of oral health practices, which translated into better brushing habits and increased preventive dental visits. Digital-based interventions were more effective in fostering long-term behavior change compared to nondigital alternatives. Engagement metrics revealed higher participation rates in gamified interventions, with improved adherence to oral hygiene routines. However, most studies (39/41, 95%) exhibited moderate risk of bias, including self-reported data and potential selection biases. This review synthesized findings from 41 studies on gamification in children's oral health. Gamification, particularly mobile apps and augmented reality, has potential to significantly enhance pediatric oral health management by increasing engagement, improving oral hygiene behaviors, and promoting sustained health behavior change. Future research should explore the long-term effects of these interventions, develop culturally adaptive tools, and integrate gamification with existing public health programs to maximize their impact.

[PMID: 41187329] The prevalence and incidence of dementia are higher in migrants and those with low socioeconomic status (SES). Mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer a potentially scalable way to reduce dementia risk via risk factor modification. We co-designed the MIND-PRO app-an mHealth intervention targeting dementia risk factors through self-managed lifestyle changes and remote coaching-specifically designed for Dutch individuals with low SES and those with Turkish or South Asian Surinamese migration backgrounds. We focused on these migrant populations as they are the largest in the Netherlands and have the highest risk of developing dementia. In this qualitative study, we explored the needs and preferences of our target populations aged 50-75 years old at increased dementia risk by conducting semistructured interviews and focus groups. Participant feedback was used to iteratively refine and adapt a prototype intervention based on insights from prior mHealth trials. We interviewed 23 participants (median age 59, IQR 55-63 y; n=15, 65% female) and conducted two focus groups with 7 Turkish women and 13 Dutch participants with low SES. The target populations emphasized personalization features such as goal setting, self-tracking, educational material, and remote coaching. Participants highlighted the importance of social interaction and autonomy in achieving sustainable lifestyle changes. Tailoring coaching and lifestyle advice to cultural practices was deemed beneficial. Optimal mHealth interventions targeting dementia risk factors in migrants and individuals with low SES should be personalized and interactive, respect autonomy, and integrate cultural needs and preferences.

[PMID: 41187314] A global aging population seeking resolution of pain and functional decline from degenerative spine conditions is leading to an increasing number of spine surgeries. The recovery process is complex with many cognitive and physical actions performed by the patient, which can be conceptualized as patient work. Shaped by the dynamic patient work system (PWS), patient work is the time and effort patients complete at home and across health settings to meet their health goals. Our aim was to define factors in the PWS that influence the patient work of older adults' recovery during the hospital and posthospitalization phases as well as by discharge location after spine surgery.METHODS: Secondary data analysis (28 interviews) using deductive and inductive qualitative content analysis methods was used to describe PWS influencing factors. The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety 2.0 human factors framework (person, organization, task, tools and technology, and internal and external environments) guided independent (3 members) coding, codebook evolution, and team deductive analysis. Care phase and discharge location were further analyzed using team inductive analysis.RESULTS: In nearly all components, factor differences were present between discharge to home or skilled nursing facility or inpatient rehabilitation. These differences included pain severity, mobility, unexpected experiences, education not meeting their needs, the level of problem-solving required, and types of benchmarks to their goal of recovery.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that regardless of discharge disposition, older adults experience uncertainty and different needs during recovery that often generate invisible work in navigating the recovery process. Participants describe significant work to clarify any uncertainty and meet their recovery needs. Nursing has a pivotal role to further investigate strategies to help patients achieve their recovery goals.

[PMID: 41187273] This study assessed the long-term clinical outcomes of women (≥50 years of age) who undergo operative management of lateral tibial plateau fractures, with particular focus on risk of conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A retrospective review was conducted on female patients aged 50 and older who sustained lateral tibial plateau fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) at a level 1 trauma center between January 2003 and July 2023. The primary outcome measure was conversion to TKA. Secondary outcome measures included lateral joint subsidence, arthrosis progression, surgical complications, and reoperations for any reason. Forty-one women underwent ORIF of lateral tibial plateau fractures during the study period with an average age of 63.5 ± 9.0 years. The mechanism of injury for most patients was a ground-level fall (n = 24, 58.5%). At final follow-up, lateral joint subsidence was present in 22 women (53.7%), and patients progressed an average of 1.0 Kellgren-Lawrence grade in terms of arthrosis. A total of 7 women (17.1%) underwent conversion to TKA at a mean of 4.0 years after ORIF. Women 50 years and older demonstrated a 17.1% rate of conversion to TKA following operative management of laterally impacted tibial plateau fractures, more than two times higher than rates seen in the general population affected by these fractures. Appropriate counseling should be offered preoperatively for these patients.

[PMID: 41187200] Physical Activity (PA) is essential for enhancing the physical function of pre-frail and frail older adults. However, among this group, PA-levels vary significantly. Identifying the factors contributing to these differences could support tailored PA interventions. This study aims to examine factors associated with physical activity levels among pre-frail and frail older adults in rural China. This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 284 (pre)frail older adults (aged ≥60 years) were included from ten rural healthcare centers in Northeast China. Participants were categorized into low-moderate and high physical activity groups assessed using the Short Form International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Four-dimensional data were collected, including demographics, health behaviors, objective physical performance measures, and self-reported perceived health profiles. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a machine learning algorithm, was employed for binary classification (low-moderate vs. high physical activity). Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. To enhance interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were utilized to identify key predictive variables. Mean age of participants was 70 years (59% female, 86% farmers). The low-moderate group averaged 1,187 MET/week, while the high physical activity group reached 8,162 MET/week. Physical performance tests showed significantly better scores in the high PA group. The XGBoost model achieved 82.4% accuracy (AUC: 0.769, specificity: 90%, sensitivity: 63%). SHAP analysis revealed that self-reported social support, general health, ambulation, and physical performance measures were the most important factors. The high physical activity group demonstrated better physical function than the low-moderate physical activity group; though, both groups showed poorer physical function compared to the general older population. Self-reported health perceptions and social support significantly correlated with physical activity levels. Addressing these factors through targeted interventions-including community-based social support programs and structured mobility-enhancing exercises-may contribute to improved health outcomes and enhanced quality of life in this population.",10

We conducted a genome-wide association study for AD among 2096 ɛ2 carriers. The potential role of the top-ranked gene and complement 4 (C4) proteins, which were previously linked to AD in ɛ2 carriers, was investigated using human isogenic APOE allele-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes and in 224 neuropathologically examined human brains. PPP2CB rs117296832 was the second most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphism among ɛ2 carriers (P = 1.1 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ) and the AD risk allele increased PPP2CB expression in blood (P = 6.6 × 10<sup>-27</sup> ). PPP2CB expression was correlated with phosphorylated tau231/total tau ratio (P = .01) and expression of C4 protein subunits C4A/B (P = 2.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ) in the iPSCs. PPP2CB (subunit of protein phosphatase 2A) and C4b protein levels were correlated in brain (P = 3.3 × 10<sup>-7</sup> ). PP2A may be linked to classical complement activation leading to AD-related tau pathology.

[PMID: 29632371] Efforts to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail in human trials, suggesting a pressing need to study AD in human model systems. Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.

[PMID: 41187107] Emerging clinical evidence suggests a link between environmental noise and the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNcDA neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNcDA neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41187062] While neuronal activity is essential for brain function, it also poses threats to neuronal integrity. Here, we show that activity-induced expression of stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) protects neurons from degeneration. Previously considered germline specific, Stra8 is expressed in the adult mouse brain and is induced by neuronal activity via calcium influx and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling. Neuron-specific Stra8 knockout mice display hallmark features of neurodegeneration, including DNA damage, impaired proteostasis, inflammation, nuclear envelope erosion, reduced dendritic plasticity, memory deficits, and heightened excitotoxic vulnerability. Electrophysiological studies reveal disrupted inhibitory circuit function. Mechanistically, Stra8 binds regulatory regions of neuromodulator genes and regulates their expression. Notably, Stra8 loss upregulates the expression of Npas4, an immediate-early gene critical for inhibitory circuits, but the aberrant protein is mislocalized to the nuclear periphery. These findings identify Stra8 as an activity-dependent transcriptional regulator that safeguards neuronal structure and function.

[PMID: 41186927] Sirtuins have gained significant prominence in scientific research due to their involvement in a wide array of biological processes, including DNA repair, genome stability, transcription modulation, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of their function has been implicated in various pathologies, including cancer, where sirtuins exhibit context-dependent effects. Consequently, the development of sirtuin inhibitors and activators remains an exceptionally important field of research, focusing on the design of selective modulators targeting individual sirtuin isoforms. This review includes the patents regarding sirtuin modulators released from 2020 to 2024 and provides a concise overview of the most relevant modulators developed so far. Relevant patents were systematically identified through comprehensive searches in PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), Google Patents (https://patents.google.com), and Espacenet (https://worldwide.espacenet.com). Sirtuin modulators are pivotal in addressing aging, metabolism, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Sirtuins regulate key cellular processes like DNA repair, genome stability, and mitochondrial function. Activators show promise in mitigating many age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and neurodegeneration. Inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in oncology and neurodegenerative conditions. Advances in PROTAC technology enable selective degradation of specific isoforms, enhancing therapeutic precision. With progress in drug design and high-throughput screening, sirtuin modulators hold immense potential to revolutionize treatments for complex medical challenges.

[PMID: 41186731] Increased expression of syntaxin-6, a SNARE protein involved in intracellular protein trafficking, is a proposed genetic risk mechanism for sporadic prion disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, as well as being implicated in Alzheimer's disease. However, no study has validated its functional role in prion disease, its mechanism of action nor explored the disease stage at which it is acting. Here, we show that syntaxin-6 knockdown in cellular models increases cell-associated infectivity, whilst overexpression produces the opposite effect. This observation is broadly consistent across multiple cell types and prion strains. Furthermore, syntaxin-6 knockdown leads to an accumulation of perinuclear disease-related PrP, consistent with a trafficking mechanism, and alters the morphology of disease-related PrP. We demonstrate that syntaxin-6 knockdown reduces the secretion of prions from infected cells, which provides a mechanism for the prion-related cellular phenotypes observed. Complementary in vivo studies showed that syntaxin-6 influences early stages of prion disease in experimental mice, increasing transmission risk after inoculation with low prion doses. Conversely, syntaxin-6 does not affect prion propagation kinetics or toxicity during established disease. Taken together, our studies firmly establish syntaxin-6 as a modifier of prion pathogenesis with a role in prion trafficking and export. Our findings further suggest that syntaxin-6 modifies the risk of the establishment of disease in line with its genetic association in humans. Thus, this work provides important insights into the role of a pleiotropic prion/prion-like modifier, grounded in human genetics evidence, which may have wider relevance to other neurodegenerative diseases.

[PMID: 41186495] IntroductionThere are conflicting findings regarding the influence of sex on idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) in terms of prevalence and associated clinical characteristics. This study, conducted as part of the Italian multicenter longitudinal FARPRESTO project, aims to explore sex-related differences in the age of onset, iRBD diagnosis, and phenoconversion, as well as in cognitive and non-motor features and the occurrence of RBD-related injuries among male and female patients with iRBD.MethodsThe FARPRESTO study included 536 iRBD patients recruited from 13 Italian centers. This analysis assessed the age at iRBD diagnosis, diagnostic delay, motor and non-motor symptoms, global cognitive performance, conversion rates to neurodegenerative disorders, and the prevalence of RBD-related injuries at the time of iRBD diagnosis, stratified by sex.ResultsFemale patients were older at iRBD diagnosis compared to males (males: 67.8 years, IQR 62.5-72.6; females: 69.8 years, IQR 65.1-74.8; p = 0.003). Compared to male patients, female patients exhibited a higher prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (27.9% vs. 16.2%; p = 0.019), depression (43.9% vs. 26.6%; p = 0.010), and hallucinations (43.9% vs. 26.6%; p = 0.010) at iRBD diagnosis. Additionally, self-directed injuries were significantly more frequent in females compared to males at the first visit (71% vs. 53.2%; p = 0.034). No significant differences were observed in the phenoconversion rate between sexes.ConclusionAlthough research on sex-related differences in iRBD remains limited, this study highlights the importance of understanding sex-specific characteristics. As diagnostic and therapeutic approaches evolve, incorporating these differences will be essential for tailoring clinical strategies and improving patient outcomes.

[PMID: 41186277] Oxidative damage to RNA is associated with neurodegeneration, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer development. Studies that monitor RNA damage by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> often omit the physiological buffer bicarbonate in the reaction, which fails to account for the influence of the buffer on the iron-Fenton reaction. Herein, we monitored two in vitro systems to understand how bicarbonate redirects the iron-Fenton reaction from a hydroxyl radical (HO<sup>•</sup>) generator in the absence of bicarbonate to one that predominantly yields carbonate radical anion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup>) in the presence of this buffer. Using the HO<sup>•</sup>-selective fluorophore terephthalic acid, we found that the Fe(II)-ligand identity impacted the bicarbonate concentration required to transition the Fenton reaction to predominantly yield CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup>. These findings were then corroborated by following the oxidation of guanosine (rG), which reports on oxidation by both radicals, and uridine (rU) oxidation, which responds to only HO<sup>•</sup> as the oxidizing species. The studies found that as the Fe(II)-ligand complex stability increased, the bicarbonate concentration inflection point to favor CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup> production and rG oxidation also increased. Regardless of the ligand strength, the crossover values obtained were below physiologically relevant bicarbonate concentrations (<20 mM). Next, <i>Escherichia coli</i> or HEK293T cells were pre-equilibrated with bicarbonate from 0 to 20 mM before a bolus addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The bicarbonate-dependent inflection points for favoring CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup> over HO<sup>•</sup> (or ferryl) for <i>E. coli</i> (7.3 mM) and HEK293T (11.3 mM) cells differed, but were below physiologically relevant concentrations, supporting the hypothesis that the cellular iron-Fenton reaction normally yields CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup>. The redox-cycling compound menadione was used for continuous in-cell generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to find bicarbonate dependencies in oxidation reactions of RNA. The studies herein point toward the redirection of the iron-Fenton reaction in cells to predominantly yield CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup> that selectively damages rG sites in the transcriptome.

[PMID: 41185489] Advances in proteomics continue to expand our understanding of how protein systems regulate platelet function in hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammation. However, clinical translation of platelet proteomics findings remains limited. This review highlights recent studies of platelet proteomes and platelet function in development, aging, and disease. Studies have defined platelet proteomes associated with hypoactivity and hyperactivity across embryonic, neonatal, adult, and aging states. Phosphoproteomics has revealed signaling pathways linked to platelet dysregulation in aging, nutrient states, and specific diseases. Analyses of platelet secretomes and extracellular vesicles show agonist, therapy, and disease-associated signatures in diabetes, neurodegeneration, cancer, and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Proteomic profiling of thrombi in myocardial infarction, stroke, and sepsis has uncovered distinct signatures implicating platelets in clot architecture, fibrinolysis resistance, and immune crosstalk. Proteomics continues to define alterations in platelet composition shaped by development, aging, and disease, identifying molecular effectors of platelet function and pointing to biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Platelet proteomics is increasingly positioned to inform precision strategies in thrombotic and inflammatory disorders and to refine models of vascular biology and medicine.

[PMID: 41185432] The amyloid cascade hypothesis, proposed over 30 years ago, places amyloid-β (Aβ) at the center of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Though controversial, recent clinical successes with Aβ-targeting therapies have reinforced its importance. However, these treatments have shown only modest clinical benefits in line with a two-stage AD progression: an early phase driven by Aβ-seed and a later phase that progresses at least partly independently of Aβ. Evidence of Aβ seed transmission in humans raises both therapeutic potential and biosafety concerns. This review explores current understanding of Aβ seeds, including challenges in studying such seeds, model systems to study Aβ seeds, and biosafety issues when working with Aβ seeds.",10

But for the millions of PWH on oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) worldwide, this requires consistent, sustained adherence. Review of interventions to support adherence published in recent literature can provide insights into promising and effective strategies. We conducted a hybrid systematic-narrative literature review to explore optimal adherence strategies in the era of universal test-and-treat. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science according to PRISMA guidelines for peer-reviewed studies, available in English, including people ≥ 12 years old taking ART, published between 01 January 2015 and 18 January 2024. We extracted data on the included studies and the adherence interventions (strategies used -allocated to one of 14 a priori categories or 'other', measures of adherence, and intervention outcomes). Descriptive statistics were used for study information and those interventions with a positive effect were described narratively. We extracted data from 230 studies evaluating a total of 262 interventions among 97,037 PWH. Most studies enrolled participants in Africa (106, 46%) or North America (80, 35%). The majority randomized participants (215, 94%), including 30 cluster-randomized trials. Most included general HIV clinic populations, with 51 (22%) focused on youth and 23 (10%) on pregnant and post-partum women. Many (146, 64%) used VL as an outcome. Self-reported adherence was also a commonly used outcome (129, 56%), but a minority used self-reported measures alone (36, 16%). The most common intervention strategies included across the 262 interventions were eHealth/ mHealth technologies (90, 34%) and adherence-focused counseling (81, 31%). The majority of interventions had 'other' intervention features (133, 51%), typically combined with one or more of the a priori-defined strategies (107, 80%). Most studies evaluated an approach with multiple strategies packaged into a single intervention (k = 182/262, 70%).The majority of interventions had some evidence of effect on an adherence outcome (k = 159, 61%). In studies reporting VL outcomes, 52% (k = 87/166) found some evidence of effect, while 28% (k = 47/166) found significant effects. Intervention strategies demonstrating significant impact on VL included task-shifting and changing dispensing schedules (3/5, 60% in both), while nearly half the evaluations of economic strategies demonstrated significant impact on VL (10/21). A number of different adherence intervention strategies have the potential to impact viral suppression in different populations. Variability in intervention strategies and the resulting outcomes, supports calls to target interventions to PWH who are most likely to benefit, while at the same time addressing social determinants of health and reducing barriers to accessing care to make services more person-centered. Greater attention to evaluating flexible, tailored, complex interventions may offer valuable insights for moving towards the next generation of highly generalizable, sustainable adherence support.

[PMID: 40982812] Children infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) exhibit the lowest neurodevelopmental scores. Mother-to-child-transmission prevention include perinatally and early antiretroviral therapy (ART) although long-term effects of in utero exposure to ART on neurodevelopment remain unclear. It was difficult to determine whether these reported neurodevelopmental scores were a direct result of HIV. A systematic search was conducted to identify the environmental and neurobiological factors associated with HIV infection and their impact on neurodevelopment. It was carried out across four electronic databases: Scopus, PubMed, ProQuest and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We selected 15 articles published between 2012 and 2024. Regarding ART, 4 articles reported a positive effect of ART regardless of the age of initiation and duration. We couldn't identify caregiver distress as a risk factor. Further research should include large cohort studies assessing long term consequences of ART exposition on children's neurodevelopment and impact of caregiver distress on child neurodevelopmental outcomes.

[PMID: 40934266] Despite universal HIV test-and-treat policy in South Africa, vertical transmission continues to occur. We evaluated the temporal effectiveness of vertical transmission prevention (VTP) over three maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) policy periods (three-drug ART accessible to those with CD4 counts <200 cells/µl (January 2010 - March 2010); < 350 cells/µl (April 2010 - April 2013); and lifelong ART regardless of CD4 count (May 2013 - December 2020)) in Western Cape, South Africa using public sector routine individuated data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with child HIV infection as the primary outcome. The cohort of 842 641 pregnancies from 2010-2020, inclusive of child HIV exposure, maternal ART, and child outcomes, was enumerated using administrative, laboratory and pharmacy data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations with vertical transmission. The proportion of pregnant women living with HIV (WLWH) initiating ART prior to pregnancy increased from 20.9% in 2010 to 71.1% in 2020. Of all pregnancies 17.1% (143 987/842 641) were HIV exposed and 16.3% (137 572/842 641) had a record of a child HIV outcome, of whom 3966 (2.9%) were HIV positive by 24 months. Among children with known maternal HIV exposure (143 987), 32.0% had unknown HIV status and 2.1% were diagnosed with HIV by study closure. In 2020, HIV status was ascertained in 87.2% (16 908/19 382) of children exposed to HIV. Children born in policy period 3 were less likely to have HIV than children born in policy period 2 (aOR 0.66; 95% CI 0.60-0.72), mediated through expanded ART access. Between 2017 and 2020, 16.5% of child HIV diagnoses were from pregnancies without maternal HIV exposure records. Young maternal age, no antenatal ART, previous tuberculosis and no records of antenatal visits were associated with vertical transmission in all periods. Using routine data, we report an increase in WLWH initiating ART prior to pregnancy, and a decline in vertical transmission of HIV over three policy periods. Although HIV diagnosis amongst children exposed to HIV has reduced over time, the proportion of infections in children without established exposure emphasises the need to optimise VTP opportunities.

[PMID: 40835055] The global HIV epidemic continues to affect millions of people and significantly affects children. Approximately 16 million children born to HIV-positive women, categorized as HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU), face unique developmental hurdles despite not contracting the virus. These children are more likely to experience developmental issues due to factors such as exposure to maternal HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART), nutritional shortages, and adverse social conditions. Research indicates that children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) may have subpar neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to those born to HIV-negative women. Despite the growing awareness of HEU children's challenges, there remains a gap in comprehensive reviews that synthesize knowledge about the influences on their development, especially with current ART protocols. This review examines these developmental challenges, focusing on growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes; the effects of maternal HIV infection and ART; and the influence of nutrition, socio-environmental factors, and biological mechanisms on health outcomes in HEU infants. Children with HEU are at higher risk of growth deficits and neurodevelopmental delays. Maternal health issues, such as poor nutrition and mental health disorders, adversely affect fetal and postnatal development. Socioenvironmental conditions also shape the developmental outcomes of HEU children. In-utero exposure to HIV and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), along with neonatal ARV exposure during breastfeeding, can negatively affect an infant's immune function, brain structure, growth patterns, and neurodevelopment. While studies have shown differences between children born HIV-uninfected but exposed to HIV/ARV and their unexposed peers, several limitations have been noted. Much of the immunological, neurological, and mortality data in children born HIV-uninfected but exposed to HIV/ARV lacks non-HIV-exposed and ARV-exposed controls, making it challenging to distinguish between the effects of ARVs and HIV exposure. These limitations emphasize the need for future studies with well-defined control groups to isolate the effects of ARVs from HIV exposure better. HEU infants face multifactorial developmental challenges arising from the interplay of biological factors, including maternal immune activation, systemic inflammation, ART-related mitochondrial toxicity, and altered infant immune function and socio-environmental determinants such as nutritional deficiencies, food insecurity, and maternal mental health disorders. These interacting factors collectively impair growth, neurodevelopment, and immune competence. To mitigate these adverse outcomes, targeted interventions are urgently needed, including optimizing ART regimens to reduce infant toxicity, implementing comprehensive nutritional and food security support for mothers and children, addressing maternal mental health and psychosocial wellbeing, and strengthening early childhood development programs alongside improved healthcare access. Future research must employ rigorous longitudinal designs with well-matched control groups to disentangle the effects of HIV and ART exposure and to inform effective, integrated strategies that promote optimal health and development in HEU children.

[PMID: 40733121] Pregnancy introduces significant physiological changes that alter the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antiretroviral therapy (ART), impacting its safety and efficacy in HIV-positive women. Optimizing ART during pregnancy is critical to maintaining maternal virological suppression and preventing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. This review evaluates the impact of pregnancy-induced PK changes on ART and proposes strategies for tailored regimens to improve outcomes. A comprehensive review of published literature was conducted, focusing on PK adaptations during pregnancy and their implications for different ART classes, including protease inhibitors (PIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Key studies were analyzed to assess drug exposure, efficacy, and safety. Pregnancy significantly alters the PK of antiretrovirals, with increased hepatic metabolism, renal clearance, and changes in plasma protein binding leading to reduced drug exposure. For example, drugs like lopinavir and atazanavir require dose adjustments, while dolutegravir maintains efficacy despite reduced plasma levels. Integrase inhibitors demonstrate favorable virological suppression, although cobicistat-boosted regimens show subtherapeutic levels. Tailored approaches, such as therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), optimize ART efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Pregnancy-specific PK changes necessitate evidence-based ART adjustments to ensure virological suppression and reduce MTCT risk. Incorporating TDM, leveraging pharmacogenomic insights, and prioritizing maternal and neonatal safety are critical for personalized ART management. Further research into long-acting formulations and global guideline harmonization is needed to address disparities in care and improve outcomes for HIV-positive pregnant women.

[PMID: 40721832] In Malawi and elsewhere in Africa, many children living with HIV are unaware of their status, often because of missed services for the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV (PVTH). Pregnant and breastfeeding women (PBFW) living with HIV frequently go without viral load (VL) monitoring and their infants miss key HIV testing milestones for early infant HIV diagnosis (EID). In Malawi, the current standard of care (SOC) involves mostly passive approaches to pediatric HIV diagnosis, relying on mothers presenting to health facilities with their infants. To reach PBFW living with HIV and their infants who miss critical HIV services and who are at higher risk for adverse HIV outcomes, including vertical transmission, we developed the ""Point-of-care Active Case finding & Management"" or ""PAC-Man"" model. PAC-Man uses a multifaceted implementation strategy involving task-shifted mobile teams to reach these mother-infant pairs (MIPs) with evidence-based point-of-care (POC) technology for EID and maternal VL testing in the community, linked to back-to-care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services. We will conduct a hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation incomplete stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in 12 clinics in Malawi over a 3-year period to test our strategy. Control periods will reflect SOC. Intervention periods will add PAC-Man to SOC. The primary outcome is reach of infant EID testing by age 6 months in the clinic population. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of infants newly diagnosed with HIV initiating ART and maternal VL testing reach. These outcomes will be assessed using routinely collected clinic data augmented with field surveys enrolling a sample of MIPs randomly selected from each clinic. Implementation outcomes of acceptability, adoption, fidelity, implementation, sustainability, cost, and scalability will be assessed using convergent mixed methods. Study findings will offer new insights into the effects of differentiated, community-based services for reaching infants unaware of their HIV-positive status and their mothers and characterize the fit of the PAC-Man strategy with the national PVTH program. The study holds promise for improving access to EID and VL testing, and ART, for MIPs currently being missed by traditional facility-based approaches and could suggest a novel approach for use in real-world PVTH programs across Africa. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06493357.

[PMID: 40712615] In sub-Saharan Africa, 20-40% of people living with HIV present with advanced HIV disease (AHD), which can be diagnosed, treated, and prevented using a package of care recommended by WHO. We aimed to project the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the WHO-recommended AHD package in Malawi. Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International model, we simulated a cohort of non-hospitalised people living with HIV (aged >19 years) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), 25% of whom had AHD (CD4 count <200 cells per μL and/or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease). We assessed 13 increasingly comprehensive strategies, ranging from ART only to the WHO-recommended AHD package, including tuberculosis diagnostics (ie, sputum Xpert and urine lipoarabinomannan), tuberculosis preventive therapy, serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening with pre-emptive fluconazole treatment if CrAg-positive, and co-trimoxazole to prevent bacterial infections. Model outcomes included 1 year survival, life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, US$ per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]); we considered a strategy cost-effective if the ICER was less than $600 per QALY (based on 2023 Malawi per capita gross domestic product). ART only resulted in life expectancy of 17·45 undiscounted QALYs and discounted lifetime costs of $1450. All other strategies would increase both QALYs and costs. The WHO-recommended AHD package would result in the greatest life expectancy (19·30 undiscounted QALYs) and be cost-effective (ICER $580 per QALY). AHD prevalence and intervention efficacy had the greatest influence on ICERs; however, the WHO-recommended AHD package would remain cost-effective over a wide range of estimates. The WHO-recommended AHD package of care at ART initiation would provide substantial clinical benefits and be cost-effective in Malawi. This package for AHD should be made widely available in Malawi and similar settings.

[PMID: 40704918] Non-cholesterol sterol metabolism plays a crucial role in immune regulation. However, the non-cholesterol sterol profiles, its association with gut dysbiosis, and its impact on the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell recovery in people living with HIV (PLWH) are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we recruited 37 PLWH and 50 healthy controls to characterize non-cholesterol sterol profiles and gut microbiota composition using targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and metagenomic analysis. Correlations between sterol profiles and immune cell subsets were assessed. <i>In vitro</i> peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) model was used to validate key findings. We identified a distinct dysregulation of non-cholesterol sterol metabolism in PLWH, characterized by elevated levels of cholesterol precursors and metabolites and depleted levels of plant sterols, which were linked to gut dysbiosis. Our study results highlighted <i>Oscillibacter</i> spp. as the key regulator of sterol metabolism. Specifically, plant sterols (e.g., brassicasterol and campesterol) were found to be associated with impaired CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell recovery during antiretroviral therapy (ART). These findings were validated using <i>ex vivo</i> PBMC models, which revealed that brassicasterol stimulates T cell abnormal activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, whereas lathosterol dampens immune activation and inflammation. In summary, our study highlights the interplay between gut dysbiosis and sterol dysregulation in PLWH, demonstrating that higher brassicasterol levels impair immune recovery post-ART by promoting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell hyperactivation. Hence, targeting microbial sterol metabolism-through <i>Oscillibacter</i> spp. enrichment or plant sterol modulation-may offer novel therapeutic strategies to optimize ART outcomes by balancing immune activation and resolution.IMPORTANCEThis study is the first to integrate non-cholesterol sterol profiling with gut microbiota analysis in people living with HIV (PLWH), uncovering a unique sterol dysregulation characterized by elevated cholesterol precursors and depleted plant sterols in this population. We demonstrate that <i>Oscillibacter</i> spp. were associated with these metabolic shifts and that specific sterols differentially affect immune recovery: plant sterols such as brassicasterol impede CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell restoration by promoting hyperactivation, whereas the cholesterol derivative lathosterol mitigates inflammation and supports immune reconstitution. These insights reveal novel microbiome-sterol interactions that can be leveraged to develop targeted microbiome- and sterol-based interventions aimed at enhancing antiretroviral therapy efficacy and long-term immune health in PLWH.

[PMID: 40634954] HIV/AIDS continues to pose a significant global public health challenge, with millions affected worldwide. Despite advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART), achieving optimal adherence remains critical for improving health outcomes and preventing transmission. This study aims to identify the key determinants influencing medication adherence among HIV-positive patients in western Iran, utilizing the integrated change model as a theoretical framework to inform effective intervention strategies. This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study involved 262 HIV-positive individuals from the Behavioral Diseases Counseling Centers (BDCCs) of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences in 2021. Data were collected through structured interviews using a questionnaire based on the I-Change Model, with 255 completed responses analyzed using SPSS-16. The mean age of respondents was 39.04 years, with a majority being male (70.2%). The average medication adherence score was 21.09 [95% CI: 20.68, 21.50], indicating 84.36% adherence. In the adjusted regression model, significant determinants of medication adherence were job status (β = 0.133, P < 0.001) and behavioral skills (β = 0.296, P < 0.001), indicating their positive impact on adherence behavior. Conversely, perceived barriers (β = -0.418, P < 0.001) remained a strong negative correlate, highlighting the detrimental effect of barriers on adherence. This study underscores the critical role of job status, behavioral skills, and perceived barriers in medication adherence. Clinically, healthcare providers must prioritize strategies to mitigate barriers and increasing behavioral skills. From a policy standpoint, expanding employment opportunities for individuals with HIV can support adherence and improve health outcomes.

[PMID: 40597691] Hepatitis B virus (HBV) significantly impacts public health, particularly among individuals with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Co-infection can worsen HBV progression and increase chronic liver disease risks. This study assessed HBV marker frequency, viral load (VL), and associated factors in HIV patients in South Kivu province (Democratic Republic of Congo) to understand the health implications of HBV-HIV co-infection. This cross-sectional study, from July 1, 2019, to July 30, 2021, included 864 HIV patients aged 18 to 70 years from General Referral Hospital of Panzi (GRH Panzi), Regional Military Hospital of Bukavu (RMH Bukavu), and Fomulac Hospital. Participants, on antiretroviral therapy, ART (TDF/3TC/DTG or AZT/3TC/LPV/r combinations) or newly diagnosed, consented for blood testing for hepatitis B using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and VLs using GeneXpert. Data were analyzed with Stata SE 14.0. The study found 8.0% HBsAg positivity among HIV patients in South Kivu, with 41.3% and 14.1% showing Anti-HBc and Anti-HBs, respectively. HBsAg positivity was linked to male gender (AOR = 2.96; p = 0.007), rural origin (AOR = 4.32; p = 0.014), treatment at Fomulac Hospital (AOR = 4.87; p = 0.002), marital status (AOR = 4.55; p = 0.036), lower education (AOR = 57.25; p = 0.002), jaundice history (AOR = 3.98; p = 0.021), and < 5 years of unprotected sex (AOR = 10.96; p = 0.002). The HIV VL average was 3.26 ± 3.57 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml, with no significant difference between HIV-only and co-infected individuals (p = 0.6642). In total, 448 (58.0%) participants on ART had undetectable HIV VLs. For HBV, 43.5% had undetectable, 49.3% low, and 7.2% high VLs. A correlation existed between HIV and HBV VLs; undetectable HIV corresponded to undetectable HBV in 62.5%, and high HIV VLs to high HBV in 50.0%. High HBV co-infection rates in HIV-positive individuals in South Kivu necessitate regular HBV monitoring including prevention, screening, and vaccination strategies in HIV care. Despite ART managing both infections effectively, further research on HBV-related outcomes is essential for improving co-infected patient care.",10
Activation of PPM1D enhances p53 function.,PPM1D AND p53 activation AND PPM1D activation AND p53 phosphorylation,"39787991,38943814,36456590,34930892,33982878,33503543,33051059,32296033,31959038,31922231","[PMID: 39787991] PP2C serine-threonine phosphatase Wip1 plays an important role in normal tissue homeostasis, stress signaling and pathogenesis of various human diseases. It is an attractive drug target for cancer treatment and inhibition of its expression or activity constitute a novel therapeutic intervention strategy to prevent the development of various cancers. However, previous strategies for Wip1 suppression may be ineffective in cancers lacking p53. Here, we have characterized the activity of a novel Wip1 phosphatase activator, QGC-8-52, in preclinical models of breast malignancies. QGC-8-52 significantly sensitizes the cancer cell lines with p53 deletion to chemotherapeutic agents. This effect was mediated by the Wip1-FOXO3a interaction and subsequent dephosphorylation of Thr487 that resulted, in response to anticancer treatment, in enhancing the transcription activity of FOXO3a on the proapoptotic TRAIL gene. The sensitizing effect of Wip1 activation on chemotherapeutic drugs only targeted cancer cells lacking p53. The activation of Wip1 in normal cells provided protection from anticancer drug-induced apoptosis by reducing the strength of upstream signaling to p53. Therefore, during the treatment of anticancer drugs, the activated Wip1 phosphatase boosts the apoptosis of p53-negative tumors and protects normal tissues. Our findings may represent an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for cancers with p53 deletion.

[PMID: 38943814] Wild-Type p53-Induced Phosphatase 1 (WIP1/PPM1D) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. However, the involvement of WIP1 in kidney remains unclear. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered to induce acute injury in mice and human kidney 2 (HK2) cells in the study. The WIP1 inhibitor, CCT007093, was administered both in vitro and in vivo to assess its effect on kidney. The single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) data revealed that Ppm1d mRNA reached peak on day 2 following unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (uni-IRI) in mice, especially in the proximal renal tubules during repair phase. Compared to the control group, WIP1 protein exhibited a significant increase in renal tubules of patients with acute tubular injury (ATI) and mice with LPS-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), as well as in LPS-injured HK2 cells. In vitro experiments showed that CCT007093 increased the protein levels of NLRP3, cleaved-Caspase1, GSDMD-N and IL-1β in HK2 cells and further reduced the viability of LPS-stimulated HK2 cells. In vivo experiments showed that inhibition of WIP1 activity with CCT007093 further increased cleaved-Caspase1, GSDMD-N protein levels in kidney tissue from mice with LPS-induced AKI. In addition, LPS induces phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, a key regulator of pyroptosis, which is further activated by CCT007093. In conclusion, inhibition of WIP1 activity acts as a positive regulator of renal tubular pyroptosis mainly through the mediation of phospho-p38 MAPK.

[PMID: 36456590] The p53 transcription factor is a master regulator of cellular stress responses inhibited by repressors such as MDM2 and the phosphatase PPM1D. Activation of p53 with pharmacological inhibitors of its repressors is being tested in clinical trials for cancer therapy, but efficacy has been limited by poor induction of tumor cell death. We demonstrate that dual inhibition of MDM2 and PPM1D induces apoptosis in multiple cancer cell types via amplification of the p53 transcriptional program through the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway. PPM1D inhibition induces phosphorylation of eIF2α, ATF4 accumulation, and ATF4-dependent enhancement of p53-dependent transactivation upon MDM2 inhibition. Dual inhibition of p53 repressors depletes heme and induces HRI-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation. Pharmacological induction of eIF2α phosphorylation synergizes with MDM2 inhibition to induce cell death and halt tumor growth in mice. These results demonstrate that PPM1D inhibits both the p53 network and the integrated stress response controlled by eIF2α-ATF4, with clear therapeutic implications.

[PMID: 34930892] Developmental disorders characterized by small body size have been linked to CDK5RAP2 loss-of-function mutations, but the mechanisms underlying which remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that knocking down CDK5RAP2 in human fibroblasts triggers premature cell senescence that is recapitulated in Cdk5rap2<sup>an/an</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts and embryos, which exhibit reduced body weight and size, and increased senescence-associated (SA)-β-gal staining compared to Cdk5rap2<sup>+/+</sup> and Cdk5rap2<sup>+/an</sup> embryos. Interestingly, CDK5RAP2-knockdown human fibroblasts show increased p53 Ser15 phosphorylation that does not correlate with activation of p53 kinases, but rather correlates with decreased level of the p53 phosphatase, WIP1. Ectopic WIP1 expression reverses the senescent phenotype in CDK5RAP2-knockdown cells, indicating that senescence in these cells is linked to WIP1 downregulation. CDK5RAP2 interacts with GSK3β, causing increased inhibitory GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation and inhibiting the activity of GSK3β, which phosphorylates β-catenin, tagging β-catenin for degradation. Thus, loss of CDK5RAP2 decreases GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation and increases GSK3β activity, reducing nuclear β-catenin, which affects the expression of NF-κB target genes such as WIP1. Consequently, loss of CDK5RAP2 or β-catenin causes WIP1 downregulation. Inhibition of GSK3β activity restores β-catenin and WIP1 levels in CDK5RAP2-knockdown cells, reducing p53 Ser15 phosphorylation and preventing senescence in these cells. Conversely, inhibition of WIP1 activity increases p53 Ser15 phosphorylation and senescence in CDK5RAP2-depleted cells lacking GSK3β activity. These findings indicate that loss of CDK5RAP2 promotes premature cell senescence through GSK3β/β-catenin downregulation of WIP1. Premature cell senescence may contribute to reduced body size associated with CDK5RAP2 loss-of-function.

[PMID: 33982878] Upon exposure to genotoxic stress, cells activate DNA damage response (DDR) that coordinates DNA repair with a temporal arrest in the cell cycle progression. DDR is triggered by activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated/ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinases that phosphorylate multiple targets including tumor suppressor protein tumor suppressor p53 (p53). In addition, DNA damage can activate parallel stress response pathways [such as mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 alpha (p38)/MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) kinases] contributing to establishing the cell cycle arrest. Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) controls timely inactivation of DDR and is needed for recovery from the G2 checkpoint by counteracting the function of p53. Here, we developed a simple in vitro assay for testing WIP1 substrates in nuclear extracts. Whereas we did not detect any activity of WIP1 toward p38/MK2, we confirmed p53 as a substrate of WIP1. Inhibition or inactivation of WIP1 in U2OS cells increased phosphorylation of p53 at S15 and potentiated its acetylation at K382. Further, we identified Deleted in breast cancer gene 1 (DBC1) as a new substrate of WIP1 but surprisingly, depletion of DBC1 did not interfere with the ability of WIP1 to regulate p53 acetylation. Instead, we have found that WIP1 activity suppresses p53-K382 acetylation by inhibiting the interaction between p53 and the acetyltransferase p300. Newly established phosphatase assay allows an easy comparison of WIP1 ability to dephosphorylate various proteins and thus contributes to identification of its physiological substrates.

[PMID: 33503543] Downregulation of the p53 tumor suppressor in cancers is frequently accompanied by the upregulation of Wip1 (a phosphatase) and Mdm2 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase). Mdm2 binds and ubiquitinates p53, promoting its degradation by the proteasome. As the p53/Mdm2 interaction is alleviated by the phosphorylation of the serine-15 (S15) residue of p53, Wip1, which can directly dephosphorylate phospho-S15, facilitates the Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53. Here, we found that p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>, previously shown to bind p53 and Mdm2, reduces the cellular levels of p53 protein by decreasing its stability. This is accompanied by a decrease in p53-S15 phosphorylation levels. In agreement, p21 promotes the p53/Wip1 interaction. Additionally, p21 interacts with Wip1, forming a trimeric complex of p53, p21, and Wip1. Studies using a p21 deletion mutant that cannot bind p53 revealed that the p53/p21 complex is more efficient than p53 alone in facilitating the binding of p53 to Wip1 and Mdm2. These findings indicate that p21 is a novel negative regulator of p53 stability and therefore, may be used as a target to restore p53 activity by preventing the action of Wip1 and Mdm2 on p53.

[PMID: 33051059] Spatial learning and memory are typically assessed to evaluate hippocampus-dependent cognitive and memory functions in vivo. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases play critical roles in spatial learning and memory. Here we report that the Wip1 phosphatase is essential for spatial learning, with knockout mice lacking Wip1 phosphatase exhibiting dysfunctional spatial cognition. Aberrant phosphorylation of the Wip1 substrates p38, ATM, and p53 were observed in the hippocampi of Wip1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but only p38 inhibition reversed impairments in long-term potentiation in Wip1-knockout mice. p38 inhibition consistently ameliorated the spatial learning dysfunction caused by Wip1 deficiency. Our results demonstrate that deletion of Wip1 phosphatase impairs hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory, with aberrant downstream p38 phosphorylation involved in this process and providing a potential therapeutic target.

[PMID: 32296033] Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small population of stem cell-like cancer cells that can initiate tumors in vivo, and are the major source of cancer initiation, relapse, and drug resistance. We previously reported that the p38 MAPK, through its downstream effectors MK2 and HSP27, suppressed CSC properties by downregulating the expression of transcription factors that mediate stemness in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and that despite unaltered total expression of total p38 proteins, the levels of activated p38 were reduced in NSCLC tissues. However, the mechanism underlying the reduced levels of activated p38 in NSCLC is unknown. In this study, we identified WIP1, a p38 phosphatase frequently overexpressed in cancer, as a suppressor of p38 in a pathway that regulates CSC properties in NSCLC. Increased WIP1 expression correlated with reduced levels of activated p38, and with increased levels of a CSC marker in NSCLC tissues. Further investigation revealed that WIP1 promoted stemness-related protein expression and CSC properties by inhibiting p38 activity in NSCLC cells. WIP1 inhibitors are currently under development as anticancer drugs based on their ability to reactivate p53. We found that a WIP1 inhibitor suppressed stemness-related protein expression and CSC properties by activating p38 in NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. These studies have identified the WIP1-p38-MK2-HSP27 cascade as a novel signaling pathway that, when altered, promotes CSC properties in NSCLC development, and have defined novel mechanisms underlying the oncogenic activity of WIP1 and the anticancer efficacy of WIP1 inhibitors.

[PMID: 31959038] The phosphoinositide-3-kinase like kinases (PIKK) such as ATM and ATR play a key role in initiating the cellular DNA damage response (DDR). One key ATM target is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> that promotes G1 arrest. ATM activates p27<sup>Kip1</sup>-induced arrest in part through phosphorylation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> at Serine 140. Here we show that this site is dephosphorylated by the type 2C serine/threonine phosphatase, WIP1 (Wildtype p53-Induced Phosphatase-1), encoded by the <i>PPM1D</i> gene. WIP1 has been shown to dephosphorylate numerous ATM target sites in DDR proteins, and its overexpression and/or mutation has often been associated with oncogenesis. We demonstrate that wildtype, but not phosphatase-dead WIP1, efficiently dephosphorylates p27<sup>Kip1</sup> Ser140 both in vitro and in cells and that this dephosphorylation is sensitive to the WIP1-specific inhibitor GSK 2830371. Increased expression of wildtype WIP1 reduces stability of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> while increased expression of similar amounts of phosphatase-dead WIP1 has no effect on p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein stability. Overexpression of wildtype p27<sup>Kip1</sup> reduces cell proliferation and colony forming capability relative to the S140A (constitutively non-phosphorylated) form of p27. Thus, WIP1 plays a significant role in homeostatic modulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> activity following activation by ATM.

[PMID: 31922231] Endeavors towards identifying key molecular markers for early diagnosis and treatment are driving the clinical study of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Recent studies have indicated that protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent, 1D (PPM1D) exerts an oncogenic function by increasing cell proliferation, migration and invasion in various cancer types. In addition, PPM1D has a high frequency of genetic alterations and has been proposed as a tumor driver in thyroid cancer, making PPM1D an attractive potential oncotarget for cancer treatment. The aims of the present study were to investigate the downstream targets of PPM1D and the potential molecular mechanisms of its oncogenic activities, as well as its clinical significance in PTC. As anticipated, PPM1D overexpression was confirmed in PTC clinical specimens. Furthermore, knockdown of PPM1D in thyroid cancer cell lines significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion but facilitated cell apoptosis. The protein levels of phosphorylated p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK), p53 and Bax were increased in PPM1D‑knockdown cells, while inhibition of p38 phosphorylation restored cell migration, proliferation and cell apoptosis. In addition, silencing of PPM1D expression induced nuclear translocation of p53 in K‑1 and TPC‑1 cells. The present results demonstrated that PPM1D regulated p38 MAPK and p53 signaling pathways to promote thyroid cancer progression. Collectively with the clinical results, these data qualified PPM1D as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in human thyroid cancer.",10

Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187304] Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) represents a complex interplay of pathophysiological processes that create a self-perpetuating cycle of heart and kidney dysfunction. While it is clearly understood how hemodynamic changes connect pathogenesis in the two organs, other processes are also in play. Some are the structural changes involving both the cellular and extracellular compartments that precede functional alterations. Fibrosis, which is initiated by an inflammatory response triggering myofibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix production, is a common denominator of heart and kidney pathology in CRS. This review focuses on fibroblast activities as a crucial factor in disease onset and progression in CRS. We explore how fibrosis in one organ can trigger or worsen dysfunction in the other organ, and we describe the key pathological signaling pathways of cardiorenal fibrosis, the extracellular matrix-derived biomarkers that can aid clinical management and drug development, and the therapeutic opportunities that can be beneficial in CRS by targeting fibroblast activities.

[PMID: 41187293] Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fatal disease. Current clinically approved treatments slow disease progression but are not curative. Thus, there is a critical need to better define the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF and develop novel approaches to treat this devastating lung condition. Immune dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, accompanied by fibrosis, constitutes a key hallmark of IPF. IPF is generally considered to be a fibroproliferative disorder rather than an immune condition because, historically, immunomodulatory therapies have failed to produce significant clinical effect. This lack of response is frustrating given that there is evidence of immune dysfunction in IPF and highlights the need to clarify the role of immune cells and inflammatory pathways in IPF. There is increasing evidence that the extracellular matrix (ECM) directs cell fate and function, and we propose that ECM remodeling and immune dysfunction in IPF generate a self-perpetuating fibrotic circuit that is refractory to classical anti-inflammatory agents. Understanding the relationship between ECM and immune dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis could help identify novel therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease.

[PMID: 41187266] In the zebrafish retina, incident light undergoes wavelength-dependent processing encompassing mechanisms such as color opponency, contrast enhancement, and motion detection prior to neural transmission to the brain proper. In darkness, photoreceptors continuously release glutamate into the synaptic cleft, a process that diminishes in response to increased light intensity, thereby conveying visual signals to ON and OFF bipolar cells. Specifically, in zebrafish, the ON pathway signal transduction is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 6b (mGluR6b) and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs). Here, we demonstrate that the knockout of <i>eaat5b</i> and <i>eaat7</i> disrupts electroretinogram responses to short and long-wavelength stimuli while preserving middle-wavelength responses, suggesting wavelength-specific roles. We found differential expression of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in the outer plexiform layer, particularly in the strike zone, crucial for prey capture, supporting task-specific involvement of these signaling pathways. In order to investigate this, we developed a virtual hunting assay using UV light stimuli. Such a behavioral assay targeting short and long wavelengths indicates that EAAT5b and EAAT7 influence UV-dependent prey detection and motion sensing differently. Our findings highlight the importance of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in modulating light integration dynamics in the zebrafish retina.

[PMID: 41187230] Molecular heterogeneity in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicates patient stratification. Here, we perform integrative proteomic analysis on 272 early stage HBV-HCC tumors from four East Asian cohorts, uncovering two robust molecular subtypes. Group B (<i>n</i> = 53) is associated with hyperproliferation, oncogenic signaling, and significantly poorer overall (<i>P</i> <0.001) and relapse-free survival (<i>P</i> <0.05). In contrast, group A (<i>n</i> = 219) is enriched in differentiation and metabolic pathways. These findings are validated by matched transcriptomics (<i>n</i> = 108), aligning with established classifications. We identify subtype-specific protein signatures, with CD46, HNF1A, and ATP1B1 exclusively expressed in the aggressive group B. Finally, computational drug sensitivity prediction, validated by molecular docking, nominates Sunitinib as a potential therapy for group B patients. Our work provides a proteomic framework for improved prognostication and targeted therapy in high-risk HBV-HCC.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187205] Dopamine is known to play a role in the development of myopia. In this study, we investigated the effect of dopamine (DA) on the secretion of transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Additionally, we examined the effects of SCH23390 (D1 receptor antagonist) and sulpiride (D2 receptor antagonist) on TGF-β2 levels in ARPE-19 cells to elucidate the underlying mechanism of DA in myopia development. Human RPE cells were cultured with or without different concentrations of DA, SCH23390, or sulpiride. Cell proliferation was examined using the CCK-8 assay. Cell migration was assessed by performing a cell scratch (wound healing) assay. The expression of TGF-β2 was evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Furthermore, the secretion of TGF-β2 into the ARPE-19 cell supernatant was quantified using ELISA. Treatment with 20 μg/mL of DA significantly increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA and protein expression levels of DRD1, DRD2, YAP, and TEAD and decreased TGF-β2 levels compared with that in control group. However, treatment with 24 μg/mL of SCH23390 for 24 h significantly decreased (P < 0.05) DRD1 and TGF-β2 mRNA expression and increased DRD2, YAP, and TEAD mRNA expression in ARPE-19 cells compared with that in the control group. Additionally, the protein expression levels of TGF-β2, YAP, TEAD, and SMAD7 were consistent with the mRNA levels. Notably, treatment with sulpiride (14 μg/mL) increased (P < 0.05) DRD1 and TGF-β2 expression and decreased DRD2, YAP, and TEAD expression in the cells at both the mRNA and protein levels compared with that in the control group. Our findings suggest that dopamine suppresses TGF-β2 secretion in human retinal pigment epithelial cells primarily through activation of D2 receptors, which appears to involve the YAP-TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway. This regulatory mechanism may contribute to the control of scleral remodeling and thus influence the development of myopia.

[PMID: 41187197] The type I interferon (IFN-I) response, which includes IFN-I induction and signaling, plays an important role in a host's defence against viral infections. Many pathogenic viruses target it to evade the host immunity. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), the causative agent of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, which features high mortality in humans, has been reported in southeastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Although a previous study reported that CCHFV antagonizes IFN-I signaling in human cell lines, it is unclear how it inhibits IFN-I signaling. Here we demonstrated that the non-structural protein of CCHFV, NSm, suppresses IFN-I signaling in human cell lines. Furthermore, we discovered that NSm binds to STAT2, an important host protein in IFN-I signaling, and induces its degradation within cells. Taken together, our results imply that NSm suppresses IFN-I signaling by targeting human STAT2.",10

The kinetic mechanism for lowering Lp(a) by alirocumab may differ according to pre-treatment apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] levels. The effect of 12-week alirocumab (150 mg subcutaneously fortnightly) on the kinetics of apo(a) was compared in statin-treated patients with high (n = 10) and very high Lp(a) concentrations (n = 11). In patients with high apo(a) concentrations, alirocumab lowered plasma apo(a) pool size (-17%, p < 0.01) chiefly by increasing the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of apo(a) (+27%, p < 0.001). By contrast in patients with very high apo(a) concentrations, alirocumab significantly lowered plasma apo(a) pool size (-32%, p < 0.001) by both increasing apo(a) FCR (+30%, p < 0.001) and lowering production rate (-11%, p < 0.05). In statin-treated patients with very high apo(a) concentrations, alirocumab lowers plasma Lp(a) concentration by a dual mode of action that increases the clearance and decreases the production of Lp(a) particles.

[PMID: 41187385] First-generation Latinx immigrant youth face risks for experiencing unique immigration-related traumas, which could exacerbate their mental health. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of forced immigration-related family separation on the association between traditional adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) among Latinx immigrant youth from the Northern Triangle (NT; El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Primary surveys assessing forced immigration-related family separation, ACEs, and mental health were administered to a sample of NT immigrant youth (N = 172). Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the study aim. In main effects analysis, forced immigration-related family separation was significantly associated with depression (B = 2.11, CI = [0.11, 4.11], p = .039) and PTSD (B = 4.01, CI = [0.63, 7.40], p = .021) symptoms. ACEs were significantly associated with depression (B = 1.34, CI = [0.86, 1.81], p < .001), anxiety (B = 1.05, CI = [0.63, 1.47], p < .001), and PTSD (B = 2.17, CI = [1.37, 2.97], p < .001) symptoms. In moderation effects analysis, the association of ACEs on depression (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.18, -0.25], p = .014), anxiety (B = -1.00, CI = [-1.86, -0.13], p = .024), and PTSD (B = -2.23, CI = [-3.84, -0.62], p = .007) symptoms was significantly attenuated among youth who experienced forced immigration-related family separation. Study findings may underscore the need to consider the inclusivity of immigration-related trauma in ACE assessment tools.

[PMID: 41187384] Treatment for gaming disorder (GD) can be challenging due to comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187378] The high moisture content and perishability of the mulberry fruit restrict its high-value utilization. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) were extracted from mulberries using ultrasound-assisted acid, alkali, and enzymatic extraction processes. The structural and functional characteristics were systematically analyzed. The highest yield of SDF (23.61 %) obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction. Structural analysis showed that both IDF and SDF had a loose and porous structure with several exposed functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Functional experiments showed that IDF exhibited superior cholesterol- and nitrite-adsorption capacities compared with SDF. IDF and SDF obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities for glucose, cholesterol, and nitrite. In conclusion, ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction simultaneously enhances both the yield and functional properties of dietary fiber extracted from mulberry, providing an effective strategy for developing high-value functional ingredients and promoting sustainable utilization of the fruit.

[PMID: 41187377] Foodborne contaminants, such as mycotoxins and microplastics, pose significant threats to human health due to their high toxicity and persistence in the food chain, thus necessitate effective mitigation strategies. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), characterized by high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, safety, and environmental friendliness, offer a promising solution for adsorbing these pollutants. This review systematically explores the roles, binding locations, interaction forces, and molecular mechanisms underlying LAB-contaminant interactions, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetic properties of the adsorption processes. Notably, LAB strains with outstanding adsorption capabilities are spotlighted, along with innovative enhancement strategies: optimized culture conditions, co-culture systems, nanoparticle functionalization, immobilized cells, and combinations with bio-adsorbents. The review further demonstrates the applications of LAB in ensuring safe food production and maintaining biological health. Future directions include multi-omics-driven gene discovery, genetic engineering techniques for precision regulation, and machine learning for adsorption optimization, advancing mechanistic insights and interdisciplinary solution.

[PMID: 41187376] There is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of current hospital-based follow-up after treatment for gynaecological cancers. Moreover, patients often report their aftercare needs are unmet. In an era of increasing pressure on healthcare resources - alongside a growing emphasis on patient-empowerment and appropriate care - it is time to reconsider current follow-up practices for gynaecological cancer survivors. This has led to a growing body of research exploring new approaches to follow-up care in gynaecologic oncology. In this scoping review, we aim to explore these alternative follow-up approaches and evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to current follow-up care. The methodological framework for scoping studies by Arksey and O'Malley's was used, further guided by the PRISMA-ScR checklist. A literature search on follow-up care for gynaecological cancers was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid) and Cochrane Library. Included studies employed a comparative method, allowing assessment of alternative approaches relative to current follow-up. Data were charted according to the TIDieR checklist and guide for better reporting of interventions. Eighteen articles were included, identifying three categories of alternative follow-up strategies: nurse-led follow-up, reduced follow-up and patient-initiated follow-up. Across all categories, these approaches showed similar - and sometimes improved - effect on oncological outcomes, quality of life, and/or patient satisfaction, without increased costs and healthcare use. Follow-up care can be delivered in alternative ways, without compromising on patient experiences or oncological safety. This offers the possibility of more cost-effective and resource-efficient healthcare. These findings support the feasibility of using alternative follow-up strategies in gynaecological oncological care.

[PMID: 41187375] To compare cost-effectiveness of targeted therapeutic strategies for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHB) patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage endometrial cancer. A Markov-based cost-utility model using a third-party payer perspective compared concurrent and maintenance treatment strategies incorporating dostarlimab and trastuzumab for newly diagnosed stage III-IV endometrial cancer: chemotherapy alone; 3 universal immunotherapy strategies (universal concurrent and maintenance dostarlimab +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu-positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas); and 3 targeted immunotherapy strategies (dostarlimab for mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas). Costs (2024 USD), utilities, and clinical estimates were derived from published literature and the National Cancer Database. The base case analysis was a microsimulation with 10,000 runs, accompanied by a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 20,000 trials. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We performed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses on key parameters and analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. All targeted immunotherapy strategies were cost-effective compared to chemotherapy alone in both NHB and NHW, while universal immunotherapy was never cost-effective. Targeted strategies were more cost-effective in NHB than NHW. Targeted dostarlimab for dMMR plus trastuzumab for HER2 serous and carcinosarcomas was the most cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy, with an ICER of $119,945/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, assuming longer durations of treatment benefit resulted in lower ICERs. Personalized treatment strategies incorporating HER2 and MMR testing should be considered to optimize both cost-effectiveness and equity in care.",10

Included studies employed a comparative method, allowing assessment of alternative approaches relative to current follow-up. Data were charted according to the TIDieR checklist and guide for better reporting of interventions. Eighteen articles were included, identifying three categories of alternative follow-up strategies: nurse-led follow-up, reduced follow-up and patient-initiated follow-up. Across all categories, these approaches showed similar - and sometimes improved - effect on oncological outcomes, quality of life, and/or patient satisfaction, without increased costs and healthcare use. Follow-up care can be delivered in alternative ways, without compromising on patient experiences or oncological safety. This offers the possibility of more cost-effective and resource-efficient healthcare. These findings support the feasibility of using alternative follow-up strategies in gynaecological oncological care.

[PMID: 41187353] The appearance time of blood components in the brain provides complementary information about cerebral microvascular dynamics. Plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) behave differently in the microcirculation: while plasma can pass through peripheral layers of capillaries, RBCs carry oxygen and are affected by phenomena such as the Fåhræus-Lindqvist effect and plasma skimming. Our study aims at visualizing these differences in vivo using H<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O PET to assess plasma appearance time (ATPlasma) and<sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub>PET to assess RBC appearance time (ATRBC), and demonstrated that the relative delay of RBCs compared with plasma correlates with the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). &#xD;Methods We retrospectively analyzed PET images obtained with<sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub>and H<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O administration in 40 patients, comprising a total of 63 scan data. Appearance time images were generated by fitting tissue curves both for the<sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub>(AT<sub>RBC</sub>) andH<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O phases (AT<sub>Plasma</sub>). AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>values were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs) and compared. Additionally, differences between AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>(ΔAT) were analyzed in relation to OEF. &#xD;Results: AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>images exhibited similar spatial distributions. A strong correlation was observed between them as AT<sub>RBC</sub>= 0.80·AT<sub>Plasma</sub>+ 1.8,<i>r</i>= 0.86), suggesting that RBCs flow faster than plasma. The difference between the two (ΔAT) showed a moderate correlation with OEF (<i>r</i>= 0.44), indicating that higher OEF values are associated with slower RBC movement relative to plasma. This finding suggests that under certain ischemic conditions, RBC flow is more severely impaired than plasma flow. &#xD;Conclusion: This study demonstrates that AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>are closely related measures of cerebral blood appearance time. The observed association between their difference and OEF suggests a potential link to ischemic pathology.

[PMID: 41187351] Epidemiological studies of large groups of nuclear industry workers offer a significant opportunity to increase our understanding of the long-term effects on health of the protracted accumulation of dose received at a low dose rate from many discrete exposures to ionising radiation. The effects of such extended aggregation of doses form an important part of the everyday concerns of radiological protection against low-level exposures. For more than half a century, databases of nuclear workers have been assembled, and the numbers of workers currently included in studies, together with the numbers of deaths among them that have now occurred, are capable of generating reasonably precise risk estimates that should provide meaningful comparisons with those obtained from other studies, such as of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, constructing, updating and maintaining these large databases, linking workers to occupational dose databases and to registers of deaths (and other outcomes, such as incident cancers) and their causes, and analyses of these data that endeavour to take account of other influential factors (such as smoking) are far from straightforward. A critical review of recent nuclear worker studies illustrates the difficulties in reliably interpreting reported statistical associations between rates of cancer and cumulative occupational doses because of the real possibility of distortions produced by biases, confounding and/or the interplay of radiation with other risk factors. This doesn't mean that studies of nuclear workers should be abandoned, far from it, but it does mean that appropriate effort needs to be expended on these studies before confident conclusions about the levels of risks from radiation exposure can be drawn from them. Unexpected findings should be examined in depth to gain a proper understanding of their origin, including the impact of doses from intakes of radionuclides upon dose-responses derived using doses from external sources of radiation.

[PMID: 41187327] Neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized as pain arising from lesions of the somatosensory nervous system. However, NP-like features have been found in several chronic secondary musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions in the absence of detectable lesion or damage to the somatosensory pathways. Emerging evidence has demonstrated associations between NP-like symptoms and altered neural activity within brain regions implicated in sensory perception and affective-emotional processing of pain with consistent findings of abnormal activity in the right insula (RIns) cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG-NF) is a brain-computer interface biofeedback technique that allows individuals to self-regulate the real-time cortical brain activities of the regions of interest. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of a novel EEG-NF intervention designed to simultaneously downtrain activity in the RIns and dACC in individuals with a chronic secondary MSK pain condition exhibiting NP-like features. In addition, this study will conduct secondary exploratory analyses to investigate EEG-derived neuronal changes and their associations with clinical and experimental pain outcomes following the EEG-NF training. We will design a single-arm, open-label, pilot-feasibility trial. We will recruit adults aged 35-75 years with a score of ≥19 using the PainDETECT questionnaire and an average pain score of ≥4 on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the last 3 months, with a minimum pain duration of 3 months, to receive active EEG-NF training. Participants will receive auditory feedback as a reward for achieving a predetermined activity threshold of the RIns and dACC. Primary outcomes will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and safety using both self-reported questionnaires and monitoring data. Collected data will be summarized descriptively, with mean (SD) reported where appropriate. Secondary outcomes will include EEG parameters, self-reported measures, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing. An exploratory within-group pre-post statistical comparison will be conducted for all secondary outcome measures, and correlation analysis will be performed to explore relationships between EEG measures, self-reported outcomes, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing measures. This study has received approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Participant recruitment began in April 2025 and is ongoing. As of October 2025, data collection has been completed, with a total of 5 participants enrolled, all of whom have completed the study to date. We expect to complete the study in March 2026. This study will generate data on feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary data to inform a fully powered effectiveness clinical trial. The results and data generated will inform the design and sample size calculation for a fully powered randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of EEG-NF in targeting NP-like features in individuals with chronic MSK pain.

[PMID: 41187282] Opioid overdose is a global public health emergency, with the United States experiencing high rates of morbidity and mortality due to prescription and illicit opioid use. Traditional public health monitoring systems often fail to provide real-time insights, limiting their capacity for early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, especially Reddit, offer a promising alternative for timely toxicovigilance due to the abundance of user-generated, real-time content. This study aimed to explore the use of Reddit as a real-time, high-volume source for toxicovigilance and develop an automated system that can classify and analyze opioid-related social media posts to detect behavioral patterns and monitor the evolution of public discourse on opioid use. To investigate evolving social media discourse around opioid use, we collected a large-scale dataset from Reddit spanning 6 years, from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2023. Using a comprehensive opioid lexicon-including formal drug names, street slang, common misspellings, and abbreviations-we filtered relevant posts for further analysis. A subset of these data was manually annotated according to well-defined annotation guidelines into 4 categories: self-misuse, external misuse, information, and unrelated, with distributions of 37.21%, 27.25%, 27.57%, and 7.97%, respectively. To automate the classification of opioid-related chatter, we developed a robust natural language processing pipeline leveraging classical machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and transformer-based architecture, and fine-tuned a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM; OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo). In the final stage, the trained LLM was deployed on an unlabeled dataset comprising 74,975 additional Reddit chatter posts. This enabled a detailed temporal analysis of opioid-related discussions, aligned with 6 years of opioid-related death records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For this study, self-misuse and external misuse were merged into a misuse category for direct comparison with the CDC's mortality data, examining whether trends in social media discourse on opioid misuse reflect patterns in real-world mortality statistics. The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 0.93, outperforming the baseline (random forest 0.85) by representing a performance improvement of 9.14% over the machine learning model. The temporal analysis of the unlabeled data revealed evolving trends in opioid-related discussions, indicating shifts in user behavior and overdose-related chatter over time. To quantify this relationship, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between misuse-related posts and CDC death records (r=0.854). This correlation was statistically significant (P<.001), indicating a strong positive relationship between web-based discussions and CDC mortality data. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating advanced natural language processing techniques and LLMs with social media data to support real-time public health surveillance. Reddit provides a valuable platform for identifying emerging trends in opioid use and overdose risk. The proposed system offers a proactive tool for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to better understand and respond to the opioid crisis.

[PMID: 41187276] Amphiphilic molecules are attracting growing interest for diverse applications in drug delivery, advanced materials, and interfacial technologies. Their structural variations offer key insights into how molecular design influences self-assembly, interfacial behavior, and functional performance. This study examined the interfacial behavior of dihexadecylpyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate (EDTS)-based surfactants as a function of various structural modifications, including headgroup quaternization (EDTS<sup>+</sup>), zinc coordination to constrain the head-tail junction (Zn-EDTS), alteration of the head-tail linkage (ester vs imine, IDTS), along with a comparison with a conventional single-tail analogue (ECS). Gas-phase density functional theory calculations revealed V-shaped geometries with varying degrees of compactness for the investigated architectures. For Langmuir monolayer studies, surface pressure-area (π-<i>A</i>) isotherms demonstrated distinct differences in the interfacial behaviors of EDTS compared to their single-tailed analogues. These findings were supported by Brewster angle microscopy, surface potential-area (Δ<i>V</i>-<i>A</i>) isotherms and atomic force microscopy measurements of films fabricated at air-water and air-solid interfaces, showing that subtle architectural modifications significantly influence packing density and domain formation. Additionally, the effect of mixing with C16-chain amphiphiles, specifically their carboxylic acid, alcohol, and trimethylammonium variants, on EDTS monolayers was studied. <i>Headgroup compatibility</i> in this class of surfactants was evaluated by isolating <i>tail-tail packing</i> contributions from the excess Gibbs free energy of mixing (Δ<i>G</i><sub>mix</sub><sup>ex</sup>) for EDTS-ECS.

[PMID: 41187162] This study examines the thermophysical properties of ethylene glycol-glycerol (60:40 v/v) hybrid nanofluids containing graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and silver nanoparticles (Ag) at concentrations of 0.1-0.5 vol.%. The nanofluids were synthesized using a two-step method with Tween-80 surfactant to enhance dispersion stability. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the morphology, lateral size, few-layer structure of GNPs, and the attachment of Ag nanoparticles. The addition of surfactant increased the zeta potential from 15.7 mV to 35.2 mV for the 0.1 vol.% GNPs/Ag formulation, indicating a marked improvement in colloidal stability. Thermal conductivity enhancement reached 102.85% at 0.1 vol.% with only a 19.84% viscosity increase. Higher nanoparticle loadings improved conductivity further but caused significant viscosity increases and reduced stability. Specific heat capacity decreased by up to 46.45%, potentially benefiting rapid thermal response applications but limiting heat storage capacity. Comparison with recent literature showed that the present formulation outperforms several similar Ag- and GNP-based nanofluids in thermal conductivity enhancement while maintaining manageable viscosity. This study is the first to report such high conductivity improvement in an EG-GLY-based hybrid nanofluid at ultra-low loading, achieved through optimized surfactant use, validated structural characterization, and benchmarking against literature. Low-concentration GNPs/Ag hybrid nanofluids, particularly at 0.1 vol.%, offer strong potential for thermal management applications where high heat transfer performance and acceptable pumping requirements are critical. However, stability limitations at higher concentrations and viscosity-conductivity trade-offs highlight the need for further optimization before large-scale deployment.

[PMID: 41187147] Mobile health (mHealth) is increasingly being used for managing chronic diseases proving its feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness in improving the health outcomes. However, effectiveness of mHealth intervention for self-management of Type 2 diabetes remains unexplored in the context of Nepal. This study aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a co-designed text based mobile health intervention for self-management of Type 2 diabetes in Nepal. We will conduct a six month, two arm (1:1) parallel group randomised control trial involving 154 adults with Type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome includes change in haemoglobin A1c level at six months follow up. Secondary outcomes include change in self-management outcomes such as self-efficacy, perceived support, diabetes related stress, health related quality of life and self-care activities. Primary and secondary outcomes will be summarized descriptively, and comparisons will be made using chi-square tests for categorical data and independent sample t-tests for continuous data. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06623006).

[PMID: 41187098] Pain, both acute and chronic, places a substantial burden on global healthcare systems. While conventional treatments may be limited in efficacy due to side effects, risk of dependency, or variable individual response, there is growing interest in mind-body complementary approaches. Yoga Nidra (YGN) has emerged as a promising non-invasive intervention for pain management. However, a clear understanding of its efficacy remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of YGN on pain outcomes. A literature search was conducted across seven databases and one trial database. Eligible studies included quantitative designs assessing the effects of YGN on pain. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials and the modified Downs and Black checklist for non-randomized studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled effect sizes. Twelve studies, comprising 1,176 participants, were included. Between-group analyses revealed that YGN significantly reduced pain compared to passive comparators (Hedge's g: -2.05, p=0.01), while comparisons with active comparators (g: -0.31, p= 0.53) showed no statistically significant differences. Within-group analyses indicated significant pain reduction following YGN (g: -2.01, p<0.001). Subgroup comparisons of single versus multiple training sessions, as well as meta-regression analyses, revealed no significant dose-response relationship across intervention durations. YGN shows potential in reducing pain intensity compared to passive control conditions, with notable within-group improvements following intervention. However, given the low methodological quality across the included studies, these effects should be interpreted cautiously, as the observed effects may represent inflated estimates. Despite these limitations, YGN demonstrates potential as a complementary approach for pain management, underscoring the need for high-quality, standardized research to establish its efficacy as a viable clinical intervention.

[PMID: 41187090] Despite favourable effects of oestradiol on cardiovascular risk factors, previous studies found higher risks of cardiovascular events in transgender women using gender-affirming hormone therapy. However, these studies did not adjust for socioeconomic status and lifestyle. This study investigated the association between gender-affirming hormone therapy and cardiovascular event risk in a large cohort of transgender persons compared with the general population, accounting for these factors. This retrospective cohort study included transgender women and transgender men using gender-affirming hormone therapy between 1972 and 2018 at the Amsterdam gender clinic. Medical diagnoses were registered from 2012 to 2022 by a national data registry. Standardized incidence ratios for myocardial infarction, ischaemic cerebrovascular accident, and venous thromboembolism were computed using general population incidence rates adjusted for socioeconomic status, estimated by education, employment, and income. Lifestyle (body mass index, smoking, and alcohol consumption) was analysed by age group. Adjusted for socioeconomic status, transgender women (N = 2714, 23 907 person-years) had lower myocardial infarction risk (.50 [.32; .71]), similar cerebrovascular accident risk (.94 [.72; 1.19]), and higher venous thromboembolism risk (1.81 [1.33; 2.35]) compared with general population men. Transgender men (N = 1617, 13 457 person-years) had higher myocardial infarction risk (4.20 [2.72; 6.01]), higher cerebrovascular accident risk (1.55 [1.01; 2.20]), and similar venous thromboembolism risk (1.00 [.53; 1.61]) compared with general population women. Socioeconomic status minimally impacted these results. Lifestyle largely resembled the general population. Gender-affirming hormone therapy is not associated with increased cardiovascular risk in transgender women but is in transgender men. This aligns with known effects of oestradiol and testosterone on cardiovascular risk factors.",10

Initially confined to Central and West Africa, Mpox has recently spread to non-endemic regions, raising global health concerns. This review provides a comprehensive update on the virus's structure, transmission, replication, clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and vaccination strategies. The Mpox virion is brick-shaped, enveloped, and replicates entirely in the cytoplasm using virus-encoded enzymes. Transmission occurs through close contact with infected individuals or animals, respiratory droplets, fomites, and potential vertical transmission during pregnancy. Clinically, Mpox presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, fatigue, myalgia, and progressive skin lesions that evolve from macules to pustules and scabs. Diagnosis relies primarily on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), supplemented by virus isolation, serology, and electron microscopy. Antiviral therapies such as tecovirimat (TPOXX), cidofovir, and brincidofovir are under consideration, with tecovirimat showing the most clinical promise. Vaccination remains the most effective preventive measure. Currently approved vaccines include ACAM2000, LC16 KMB, and JYNNEOS (MVA-BN), with JYNNEOS preferred due to its safety profile, especially for immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women. Preventive strategies, public education, and international surveillance are essential to mitigate further outbreaks. Understanding the biology, clinical behavior, and control measures of Mpox is critical for informing future responses and improving global preparedness.

[PMID: 41182409] Relapse is a major cause of failure in human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Clinicopathologic criteria for adjuvant treatment remain imprecise and have not changed for decades. We investigated whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in lymphatic exudate collected via surgical drains (""lymph"") 24-hours after surgery identified molecular residual disease (MRD) and compared its performance to time-matched plasma. Using an ultra-sensitive tumor-informed sequencing approach, tumor variants were called in lymph and plasma to classify patients as ctDNA-positive or ctDNA-negative, trained in an initial cohort of 36 patients and replicated in an independent cohort of 37 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared in ctDNA+ vs. ctDNA- patients. Lymph identified MRD in two independent multi-site cohorts (initial cohort sensitivity= 76%, specificity= 63%, log-rank P= 0.01; replication cohort sensitivity= 65%, specificity= 70%, log-rank P= 0.04). Lymph performance was enhanced in locoregional relapse (sensitivity= 78%, specificity= 67%, log-rank P= 0.0004) and generalized to early-stage patients. Analysis of matched plasma collected at this early timepoint was not predictive of recurrence (sensitivity= 35%, specificity= 72%, log-rank P= 0.7). In patients with intermediate-risk pathology, lymph ctDNA was associated with recurrence (sensitivity= 88%, specificity= 67%, log-rank P= 0.0008), suggesting an opportunity for improved stratification of patients who may benefit from additional adjuvant treatment. Postoperative lymph is a novel, proximal, and early source of MRD with the potential to introduce more precision into adjuvant therapy decision-making and improve outcomes, especially for intermediate-risk HPV-independent HNSCC patients.

[PMID: 41171880] The germinal center (GC) reaction drives the production of high-affinity antibodies by iterative cycles of B cell somatic hypermutation, selection, and proliferation. How GC B cells undergo rapid cell division while maintaining genome stability is poorly understood. Here, we show that the RNA binding proteins ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 act downstream of antigen sensing and protect GC B cells from replication stress by controlling a cell cycle-related posttranscriptional regulon. They safeguard the successful completion of mitosis by balancing CDK1 and p21-mediated regulation of cell-cycle progression. In their absence, GC B cells are prone to arrest in the G<sub>2</sub>-M phase and die by apoptosis, resulting in curtailed GC responses. DNA replication forks stalled at active replication initiation zones, causing replication stress and increased activity of the ATR-CHK1 DNA damage response. Thus, RNA binding proteins guide posttranscriptional gene regulation and maintain a functional G<sub>2</sub>-M checkpoint in GC B cells.

[PMID: 41170431] <i>Pochonia chlamydosporia</i> is an important egg-parasitic fungus with potential applications in the biological control of parasitic pests. However, the protein-response mechanisms during <i>P. chlamydosporia</i> infection of nematode eggs remain unclear. In this study, we employed four-dimensional data-independent acquisition (4D-DIA) proteomic sequencing to analyze the changes in the mycelial proteome of <i>P. chlamydosporia</i> at different infection stages. In total, 4,293 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified, which were mainly involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis and modification, oxidative stress, and other key biological processes. In the early stages of infestation, the fungus rapidly adapted to the host environment by enhancing metabolism and protein synthesis, initiating the infestation mechanism, and simultaneously enhancing its antioxidant capacity to cope with the host defense response. At later stages, it fine-tuned the metabolic pathways and enhanced DNA replication to maintain proliferation and continuously strengthened the antioxidant response to host oxidative stress. In addition, the number of proteins related to fungal transporter activity varied significantly after induction, indicating that a variety of transmembrane proteins may be involved in host recognition, adhesion, and formation of invasive structures. This study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying <i>P. chlamydosporia</i> parasitic activity and establishes a theoretical foundation for the development of novel biocontrol strategies for this fungus.

[PMID: 41160542] Understanding how small molecules affect cellular morphology is essential for exploring their mechanisms of action (MoA) and identifying new therapeutic candidates. In this study, the Cell Painting Assay (CPA) was used to profile 196 small molecules in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. By applying t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) followed by density-based clustering, 18 distinct phenotypic clusters were identified based on similarities in the quantitative morphological profiles generated from Cell Painting data. Although it was initially hypothesized that clustering would reflect known MoAs, most clusters showed only partial overlap with target-based classifications. Instead, compounds from different MoA classes converged on similar cellular phenotypes, suggesting common downstream effects or shared stress responses. Notably, compounds affecting DNA replication, mitosis, or transcriptional control appeared across multiple clusters, indicating functional diversity within morphologically similar groups. Clusters enriched with mTOR/PI3K inhibitors, spindle poisons, or transcriptional CDK blockers exhibited well-defined phenotypes, supporting the robustness of the assay. In contrast, compounds inducing more subtle phenotypes formed distinct micro-clusters, highlighting the method's sensitivity. Overall, this study demonstrates that CPA can capture convergent phenotypic signatures that extend beyond target-based classification. These findings underscore the value of phenotype-driven screening for the functional annotation of chemical compounds and may help uncover unexpected relationships among molecules with diverse biological activities.

[PMID: 41160442] ObjectiveTo assess whether modifiable lifestyle factors (particularly tobacco smoking) have a potential causal effect on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation proxied by anti-EBV IgG seropositivity using Mendelian randomization (MR), and to explore the underlying mechanism <i>in vitro</i>.MethodsWe performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study (retrospective secondary analysis) using de-identified genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for 83 dietary habits, 5 tobacco smoking behaviors, and 4 sleep traits with anti-EBV IgG seropositivity as the outcome. We further conducted experiments in EBV-positive B-cell lines to examine mechanisms.ResultsGenetically proxied smoking initiation and lifetime smoking were associated with higher odds of anti-EBV IgG seropositivity, whereas an older age at smoking initiation was associated with lower odds. No consistent associations were observed for sleep traits; dietary findings were heterogeneous across discovery and replication cohorts. <i>In vitro</i>, nicotine increased EBV-DNA levels and up-regulated lytic genes (BZLF1, BRLF1) and gp350, with concordant increases in BZLF1 and EA-D proteins; these effects coincided with ROS accumulation and were attenuated by the ROS scavenger NAC.ConclusionsOur findings support that smoking is associated with EBV seropositivity and nicotine-induced oxidative stress as a plausible mechanism. Modifying smoking behaviors (e.g. delaying initiation and reducing lifetime exposure) may help lower anti-EBV IgG seropositivity.

[PMID: 41155227] Cancer is a multifaceted disease characterized by uncontrolled cell division resulting from substantial disruptions of normal biological processes. Central to its development is cellular transformation, which involves a dynamic sequence of events including chromosomal translocations, genetic mutations, abnormal DNA methylation, post-translational protein modifications, and other genetic and epigenetic alterations. These changes compromise physiological regulatory mechanisms and contribute to accelerated tumor growth. A critical factor in this process is the dysregulation of transcription factors (TFs) which regulate gene expression and DNA transcription. Dysregulation of TFs initiates a cascade of biochemical events, such as abnormal DNA replication, that further enhance cell proliferation and increase genomic instability. This microenvironment not only sustains tumor growth but also promotes the accumulation of somatic mutations, thereby fueling tumor evolution and heterogeneity. In this study, we employed an in silico approach to identify TFs regulating 622 key genes whose mutations are implicated in carcinogenesis. Transcriptional regulatory networks were analyzed through bioinformatics methods to elucidate molecular pathways involved in cancer development. A thorough understanding of these processes may help to clarify the function of dysregulated TFs and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches designed to make cancer treatments personalized and efficacious.

[PMID: 41148535] Melanoma is a type of cancer that originates in melanocytes with high malignancy, mainly because the cancer cells can spread through the body and cause metastasis. It is projected that the annual incidence of melanoma will increase by over 50% between 2020 and 2040. DNA vaccines have been explored for the treatment and prevention of various globally important diseases and are a promising resource for melanoma. Generally, DNA vaccines are classified as third-generation vaccines, which consist of DNA plasmids encoding target antigens. Therefore, their mechanism of action involves delivering one or more genes of interest into host cells, triggering an immune response against the target antigen. In summary, the DNA vaccine must enter the cell cytoplasm and migrate to the nucleus to initiate replication, transcription, and production of the target antigen. Despite their many advantages, DNA constructs produce low levels of antigens in vivo due to the challenges in effectively activating an immune response. This review addresses general aspects relevant to the application of DNA vaccines in the landscape of melanoma treatment, focusing mainly on physical and chemical methods used to enhance DNA-based vaccines, considering key aspects of technology, advantages, limitations, applications, and the evolution of clinical translation.

[PMID: 41141590] <i>Francisella tularensis</i> is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia in humans and animals. It has a remarkable ability to survive and replicate within a wide range of host cells. <i>F. novicida</i> shares many characteristics with of <i>F. tularensis</i>. However, it is rarely pathogenic in humans, and its reduced virulence makes it a suitable model organism for studying <i>F. tularensis</i> infection. This study aimed to identify the pathogenic factors of <i>F. novicida</i>. Using a novel infection model with HeLa cells expressing FcγRII (HeLa-FcγRII cells), we screened 2,232 transposon mutants of <i>F. novicida</i> pre-treated with antiserum containing <i>F. novicida</i> antibodies to find less cytotoxicity strains. The transposon insertion site was identified by sequencing, leading to the determination of the genes responsible for the attenuated cytotoxicity. Additionally, the intracellular behavior of the mutant was investigated within both HeLa-FcγRII and THP-1 cells. A total of thirteen mutants with attenuated cytotoxicity were isolated, and their responsible genes were identified. They are <i>figE, slt, fopA, iglC, igID, iglF, iglI, pdpB, pdpA, ampG</i>, <i>wbtF</i>, and one unnamed gene (FTN_0096). We focused on the <i>wbtF</i> gene. The <i>F. novicida</i> wild-type (WT) strain showed intracellular replication in HeLa-FcγRII and THP-1 cells, but the number of intracellular <i>wbtF</i> mutants decreased. The <i>wbtF</i> mutant could not escape from phagolysosomes in the initial phases of infection and was digested within the lysosome. The <i>wbtF</i> mutant was also detected in the mitochondria and the Golgi complex. The cytokine response induced by <i>wbtF</i> mutant was comparable to that of the WT strain. These findings indicate that <i>wbtF</i> is important for the intracellular replication of <i>F. novicida</i>.

[PMID: 41140146] DNA copy number changes are the most frequent genomic alterations in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that Rad27/FEN1, a structure-specific nuclease in budding yeast, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats. Severe rDNA instability is observed in the rad27∆ mutant, independently of Fob1-mediated DNA replication fork arrest and DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation in the rDNA. The rad27Δ mutant accumulates Okazaki fragments in the rDNA region, without inducing the formation of detectable DSBs. Similar rDNA instability is observed in DNA ligase<sup>Cdc9</sup>-deficient cells. Furthermore, Exonuclease 1 and PCNA partially compensate for the loss of Rad27 in rDNA stabilization. These findings highlight the importance of proper Okazaki fragment maturation in the maintenance of rDNA stability.",10

Two authors independently compared the study methods with those recommended in the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, British Hypertension Society and the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol validation standards. Nine studies were identified, of which only one came close to adhering to selected validation standard criteria, and found the device to be accurate. One study found device accuracy with poor adherence to standards, whereas the remaining seven found device inaccuracy with poor adherence to standards, therefore potentially reporting false conclusions. The majority of the reviewed studies validating public-use BP kiosks did not adhere to existing validation standards and therefore may have reported false conclusions. The one study that came close to following the validation standards found the device tested to be accurate. Readers must critically appraise the quality of validation studies published on these devices before interpreting their accuracy, and future studies should better adhere to existing validation standards to reduce the risk of reporting potentially false conclusions.

[PMID: 18852711] Inadequate blood pressure (BP) control in patients with treated hypertension can be influenced by patient behavior, the inaccuracy of BP measurement in the clinical setting, and the fact that no single class of medication is universally effective. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) enables accurate measurement of BP and has been recommended (by multiple societies and associations) for the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation of antihypertensive treatment. Although HBPM is thought to improve BP control as a result of patients' increased adherence to their medication, this improvement is limited. Green et al. have shown that HBPM in combination with regular internet correspondence with a medical professional is a highly effective therapeutic strategy for BP control, possibly because this strategy is associated with an increase in number of prescriptions. This strategy should, therefore, be routinely used in the management of patients with hypertension.

[PMID: 15593030] Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been developed to overcome recognized deficiencies and inaccuracies of classic (office) BP measurements in the diagnosis and management of hypertension (HTN). Although in adults it has become a valuable tool for the diagnosis and ongoing management of HTN, and its use has been documented in over 50 studies in children, few pediatric nephrologists systematically use this approach for HTN assessment. Some of the reluctance to completely embrace the technique comes from the fact that none of the major hypertension trials has been based on ambulatory BP readings. The prognostic information from ABPM studies is slowly accumulating, but there is still relatively little information on the long-term prognostic value of ABPM-derived readings. For children there are particular problems in measuring representative BP values. It would be very helpful to know to what extent ABPM can help. However, there have been few comprehensive reviews in this particular population, which leaves the practicing nephrologist rather confused. The purpose of this review is to assess the present state of knowledge of ABPM usage in children, high-lighting important studies that help to delineate the place of ABPM in their medical management. We discuss: advantages and limitations of ABPM, the variability of blood pressure in children, clinical uses of ABPM in pre-dialysis renal failure, dialysis, renal transplantation, primary renal diseases, and diabetes, comparison with adult data. The relationship between casual BP (CBP) and ABPM is presented, specifically the prevalence and relevance of either white-coat hypertension or relative 'office' hypertension. We conclude that in 2004, the sole reliance on casual BP to diagnose and to treat hypertension in children brings with it many difficulties. ABPM offers some clear solutions to these problems and thus should be routinely used in appropriately defined clinical settings, but is not a panacea.

[PMID: 14763666] Validation protocols that have been introduced for automated blood pressure (BP) measuring devices recommend procedures carried out at rest only. We aimed to determine whether venous blood redistribution affects the accuracy of the oscillometric method of BP measurement. For this purpose, we chose a popular oscillometric ambulatory BP monitor--the SpaceLabs 90207 (Osc). Lower body negative pressure (-40 mmHg) (LBNP) was used to simulate changes of body position. Fifty-one young healthy volunteers had their BP measured simultaneously by Osc and mercury sphygmomanometer (HgS) at rest (min 3 and 5), during LBNP (min 7 and 9) and after LBNP (min 11). Differences (delta, mmHg) between HgS and Osc for systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were calculated for every measurement minute. For SBP, deltaSBP-7 and deltaSBP-9 were significantly different from deltaSBP-5 (0.65 +/- 2.6 and 0.33 +/- 2.4 mmHg vs -0.80 +/- 2.9 mmHg, p < 0.003 and p < 0.02, respectively). deltaSBP-11 also differed significantly from deltaSBP-3 and deltaSBP-5 (1.16 +/- 2.5 mmHg vs -0.06 +/- 3.1 mmHg and -0.80 +/- 2.9, p < 0.01 and p < 0.00007, respectively). When graded according to British Hypertension Society protocol, Osc remained in the A class in every measurement minute. The accuracy of SpaceLabs 90207 is altered by venous blood redistribution. These inaccuracies may constitute an additional limitation of oscillometric ambulatory BP monitoring.

[PMID: 9793940] Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy remain a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and management of these disorders has relied on conventional blood pressure measurement, a technique fraught with error and uncertainty. Ambulatory blood pressure measurement is a promising new technique that has the potential to overcome the inaccuracies of conventional blood pressure measurement. Several ambulatory blood pressure monitors have been validated in pregnant populations, and normal reference ranges have been established. More recent research has focused on the potential clinical roles of ambulatory blood pressure measurement in pregnancy. This review addresses the limitations of conventional blood pressure measurement and reviews the current literature on the application of ambulatory blood pressure measurement in pregnancy.

[PMID: 2963523] The use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has gained popularity because it is not subject to those limitations associated with traditional sphygmomanometry (inaccuracy of blood pressure readings, low number of readings, and failure to represent daytime blood pressure readings). In the present study, we provide evidence that the 24-hour mean blood pressure obtained through intraarterial blood pressure measurements in ambulatory patients provides a more accurate diagnosis (and perhaps a prognosis) of hypertension than that provided by cuff-obtained casual blood pressure measurement. Furthermore, despite a reduction in the amount and in the accuracy of the information obtained, blood pressure data provided by noninvasive blood pressure monitoring are also more accurate diagnostically than cuff-obtained casual blood pressure measurements. In 15 essential hypertensive patients in whom celiprolol, 400 mg once daily, was compared with placebo in a randomized double-blind crossover study, the use of noninvasive 24-hour automatic blood pressure monitoring showed that in responsive patients, celiprolol induced a sustained reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the 24 hours. The blood pressure reduction was also apparent during the night, despite the concomitant occurrence of a slight tachycardia. These findings demonstrate that once-daily administration of celiprolol provides an effective lowering of the 24-hour blood pressure profile. This dosing schedule can therefore be regarded as appropriate for antihypertensive therapy.

[PMID: 41187384] Treatment for gaming disorder (GD) can be challenging due to comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187363] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains a major respiratory pathogen of economic concern in the poultry industry. This study investigated the farm-level prevalence of IBV and evaluated associated risk factors in northern Vietnam by a cross-sectional study from June 2022 to June 2024. A total of 69 poultry farms were randomly selected across nine provinces, and pooled tracheal swab samples were purposively collected for IBV detection using RT-qPCR. The overall IBV farm-level prevalence was 34.78 % (95 % CI:23.71-47.21 %). Although no statistically significant differences were found across provinces, production types, age groups, or flock sizes, IBV was detected in all subgroups, indicating widespread circulation of the virus. A total of 22 potential risk factors were initially assessed using univariate logistic regression. Of these, six variables with P < 0.1, including farm size, number of poultry houses, presence of multiple age groups, vaccination at day-old, frequency of disinfection before chick placement, and proximity to live bird markets and residential areas, were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model retained two independent predictors: performing more than one disinfection before chick placement (P = 0.035), and administration of a live IB vaccine at one day of age (P = 0.006), both of which were significantly associated with reduced the odds of IBV infection at the farm level. These findings suggest that strategic vaccination and careful calibration of disinfection protocols are critical to minimizing IBV transmission at the farm level.

[PMID: 41187355] Herein, a renewable polarity-switchable PEC biosensor is reported for a highly sensitive and selective assay of circRNA in human whole blood, and machine learning is exploited to assist in the circRNA intelligent diagnosis. The target circRNA-DNA3 binary structure can hybridize competitively with DNA2 in triple helix molecular to generate three-way junction probe, and Exo Ⅲ specifically cleaves DNA2 to release the circRNA-DNA3 binary complex for signal cyclic amplification. Then, Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanospheres are introduced into PEC platform, leading to the switching from anodic to cathodic photocurrents. Interestingly, biotin can competitively bind to Cu<sub>2</sub>O-SA, making the ITO/CdS/T-COF/CS/DNA1 electrode reusable for circRNA analysis. The built PEC biosensor exhibits a low detection limit (7.6 aM), excellent selectivity and satisfactory renewability. Moreover, the developed PEC biosensor for human whole blood circSATB2 assay can effectively distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Importantly, the machine learning is adopted to explore the potential pattern hidden in PEC data, and the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of circRNA intelligent diagnosis all reach 100 %. Machine learning-assisted renewable polarity-switchable PEC biosensor provides a new approach for circRNA analysis and early intelligent diagnosis of cancer.",10
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with decreased risk for functional renal insufficiency.,ACE inhibitors AND functional renal insufficiency AND risk reduction AND angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,"40660221,40542996,40074356,39708241,39586724,39239537,38458564,38299639,37889557,37539955","[PMID: 40660221] Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are key treatments for diabetic kidney disease. However, their independent and combined effects on end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and mortality remain unclear. This study evaluates their impact, alone or in combination, on ESKD and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes and hypertension. A nationwide cohort study using the Korean National Health Database included 261,783 individuals with type 2 diabetes and hypertension (2015-2017). Participants were grouped into (1) no RAS or SGLT2 inhibitors (reference), (2) SGLT2 inhibitors alone, (3) RAS inhibitors alone, and (4) combination therapy. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for ESKD, mortality, and their composite. Over 5.38 years, 2,674 (1.02%) developed ESKD and 20,866 (7.97%) died. Combination therapy showed the greatest risk reduction for composite outcomes [HR 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.82] and mortality (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56-0.83). SGLT2 inhibitors alone reduced composite risk (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.84) and mortality (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.81). RAS inhibitors alone had modest effects (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.98) on composite outcomes and mortality (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97). Notably, only combination therapy was associated with lower ESKD risk (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.37-1.07), but this was not statistically significant. SGLT2 inhibitors consistently reduced ESKD and mortality, while RAS inhibitors were beneficial mainly in non-SGLT2 inhibitor users. Combination therapy may provide the greatest renal and survival benefit for diabetic patients with hypertension. SGLT2 inhibitors alone significantly reduced mortality, while RAS inhibitors alone had a modest impact.

[PMID: 40542996] Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and its combination therapy are essential supportive treatments for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF). Hyperkalemia (HK) is the major safety concern associated with the treatments, which often leads to RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation, thereby compromising cardiovascular protective effects. Although novel potassium binders (NPBs) are recommended by current guidelines for the treatment of HK, systematic evidence is needed to guide their use in RAASi optimization and HK management. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the incidence of HK in patients with CKD or HF who received RAASi and the efficacy of NPBs in RAASi optimization. PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2023. Any studies of adult patients with CKD or HF who received RAASi were included in systematic review of HK incidence and risk factors (part 1). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of NPBs in patients with CKD or HF were included in meta-analysis on the efficacy of novel potassium binders (NPBs) (part 2). The primary outcome was optimization of RAASi therapy with NPBs. A pooled analysis was conducted in part 1. Network meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed in part 2. A total of 83 studies (24 with CKD, 54 with HF, and 5 with CKD and HF) were included in part 1 and 8 RCTs (2 with CKD, 4 with HF, and 2 with CKD and HF) were included in part 2. The pooled HK incidence was 10.7% overall at any criteria and in all patients who received RAASi. The highest incidence of HK was observed with the combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin ii receptor blockers (ARBs)/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi)+ mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (24.4%), followed by the triple therapy ACEi/ARB/ARNi+ sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i)+MRA (10.9%), and ACEi/ARB/ARNi + SGLT2i (2.2%). Novel potassium binders improved RAASi optimization by 38% compared with placebo (risk ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.16-1.65). Additionally, NPBs decreased the incidence of HK by 28% and reduced the level of potassium by 0.71 mEq/L. The CKD population showed a higher optimization rate than the HF population (84% vs 29%). The RAASi treatment was associated with high prevalence of HK, especially in bigeminal and triple therapy. The NPBs were effective in RAASi optimization and HK management, especially among the CKD population.

[PMID: 40074356] Patients with both heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), but these drugs can cause hyperkalemia, which may lead to their reduction or discontinuation, resulting in the loss of their beneficial effects. Approaches to managing RAASi-induced hyperkalemia are discordant, so in this study we aimed to establish a cross-specialty consensus on the optimal approach to managing hyperkalemia in patients with HF and CKD. The study used a modified Delphi methodology. A steering committee of Japanese cardiologists and nephrologists drafted 26 consensus statements, which were used to create a survey, distributed across Japan. A total of 250 responses were received. Consensus, defined as 75% agreement, was achieved for 21/26 (81%) statements. Respondents agreed on the importance of effective hyperkalemia management based on serum potassium levels and supported the use of potassium binders (PBs), particularly novel PBs such as sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, to treat hyperkalemia while maintaining RAASi therapy. However, when potassium levels exceed 6.0 mEq/L, reduction or discontinuation of RAASi may be considered based on individual risk factors. This consensus provides proposals that may help support the optimal management of RAASi-induced hyperkalemia in Japanese patients with HF and CKD. It highlights the importance of treating hyperkalemia alongside optimal RAASi therapy.

[PMID: 39708241] Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), such as ACE inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin-II receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, reduce morbidity and mortality in hypertension, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease. However, their use can lead to hyperkalaemia. We examined the proportions of RAAS inhibitor (RAASi) reduction or withdrawal, across GFR strata, following hospitalisation and the effect on patient mortality. This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalised from 1 January2017 to 31 December2020. Biochemistry data, clinical notes and medicines use were extracted using the CogStack platform, from electronic health records. Patients were identified by creatinine measurement during hospitalisation. Hyperkalaemia was defined as potassium > 5.0 mmol/L, with severity categorisation. RAASi discontinuation defined as ≥ 48 h without administration. Mortality risk associated with RAASi cessation was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Among 129,172 patients with potassium measurements, 49,011 were hospitalised. Hyperkalaemia prevalence was 8.57% in the emergency department and 16.79% among hospitalised patients. Higher hyperkalaemia levels correlated with increased CKD and heart failure. RAASi use was more common in hyperkalaemic patients, with higher discontinuation rates during hospitalisation (36% with potassium 5-5.5 mmol/L; 61% with potassium > 6.5 mmol/L). By discharge, 32% of patients had RAASi stopped, and 2% doses reduced. Discontinuation of RAASi was associated with 37% worse survival probability. RAASi cessation was greater with hyperkalaemia and associated with increased mortality in hospitalised patients. Reinstitution of RAASi after hospital discharge, or alternative management of hyperkalaemia if maintained on RAASi therapy, may improve clinical outcomes.

[PMID: 39586724] To analyze the effects of preoperative renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) use on postoperative renal function and short-term and long-term prognosis in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted. Based on the registration study data of CABG patients at Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the clinical data of adult patients who underwent CABG from January 2013 to December 2022 were analyzed. Preoperative use of RASi (PreRASi) was defined as receiving RASi treatment within 48 hours before surgery. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined using the diagnostic criteria of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). Demographic characteristics, past medical history, comorbidities, preoperative medication, preoperative laboratory test results, specific information on surgical procedures, and postoperative treatment related data were extracted. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative AKI. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital all-cause mortality and all-cause mortality within the longest follow-up period. According to whether RASi was used before surgery, the patients were divided into PreRASi group and No-PreRASi group. The baseline data of the two groups were balanced by propensity score matching (PSM). Logistic regression model and Cox proportional hazards model were used to assess the correlation between PreRASi and postoperative AKI and clinical outcomes, and analyze the subgroups of hypertension and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the cohort. A total of 33 884 patients who underwent CABG were included, with a mean follow-up duration of (3.0±2.4) years and the longest follow-up duration up to 8.5 years. There were 9 128 cases (26.94%) in the PreRASi group and 24 756 cases (73.06%) in the No-PreRASi group. The incidence of postoperative AKI in the PreRASi group was 47.61% (4 346 cases), compared to 52.37% (12 964 cases) in the No-PreRASi group. Two groups were matched with 5 094 patients each. Compared to the No-PreRASi group, both before and after PSM, PreRASi was associated with a reduction of risk of postoperative AKI [before PSM: odds ratio (OR) = 0.834, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.793-0.877, P < 0.001; after PSM: OR = 0.875, 95%CI was 0.808-0.948, P = 0.001]. Subgroup analysis of hypertensive and HFpEF patients showed that PreRASi was associated with a decreased risk of postoperative AKI before and after PSM. The in-hospital mortality for the PreRASi and No-PreRASi groups were 0.61% (56 cases) and 0.49% (121 cases), respectively. Analysis of the overall cohort and subgroups with hypertension and HFpEF showed no correlation between PreRASi and in-hospital mortality or longest follow-up mortality. The perioperative use of RASi can reduce the risk of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing CABG, has a certain renal protective effect, but is not associated with short-term or long-term death risk after surgery.

[PMID: 39239537] <b>Background:</b> Sodium‒glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors offer glycaemic and cardiorenal benefits in the early stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the risk of genitourinary tract infection (GUTI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may also cause deterioration of kidney function. The long-term follow-up of cardiorenal outcomes and GUTI incidence in patients with advanced CKD receiving SGLT2 inhibitors combined with ACEIs/ARBs should be further investigated. <b>Methods:</b> We analysed data from 5,503 patients in Taiwan's Taipei Medical University Research Database (2016-2020) who were part of a pre-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program (CKD stages 3-5) and received ACEIs/ARBs. SGLT2 inhibitor users were matched 1:4 with nonusers on the basis of sex, CKD, and program entry duration. <b>Results:</b> The final cohort included 205 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 820 nonusers. SGLT2 inhibitor users experienced a significant reduction in ESRD/dialysis risk (aHR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.190.67), and SGLT2 inhibitor use was not significantly associated with acute kidney injury or acute kidney disease risk. Among SGLT2 inhibitor users, those with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) had greater CVD rates. Conversely, those without a CVD history had lower rates of congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, acute pulmonary oedema, and acute myocardial infarction, although the differences were not statistically significant. Notably, SGLT2 inhibitor usage was associated with a greater GUTI incidence (aHR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.122.84) shortly after initiation, irrespective of prior GUTI history status. <b>Conclusion:</b> Among patients with CKD stages 3-5, SGLT2 inhibitor use was linked to increased GUTI incidence, but it also significantly reduced the ESRD/dialysis risk without an episodic AKI or AKD risk. Clinical physicians should consider a personalized medicine approach by balancing GUTI episodes and cardiorenal outcomes for advanced CKD patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.

[PMID: 38458564] The cardiovascular and renal benefits of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade are not well established in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify potential risks and benefits from RAAS blockade in patients with CKD stage 4-5. A Medline search from inception to November 2022 was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with CKD stage 4-5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) comparing RAAS blockade vs placebo or alternative antihypertensive therapy. Different intervention strategies were assessed (RAAS use vs nonuse, initiation vs placebo/alternative therapy, or discontinuation vs continuation). The primary outcome was progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The risk ratio (RR) was estimated with the use of a random-effects model. Nine RCTs (1150 patients) were included. RAAS blockade was associated with a significant reduction in progression to ESKD: RR 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.96; P = 0.01). There was no benefit from RAAS blockade on all-cause mortality or MACE: RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.63-1.65; P = 0.93) and RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.49-1.57; P = 0.65), respectively. RAAS blockade may be considered in selected patients with CKD stage 4-5 to delay progression to ESKD.

[PMID: 38299639] IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerular disease, with approximately 20% to 40% of patients progressing to kidney failure within 25 years. Non-immunosuppressive treatment has become a mainstay in the management of IgAN by improving blood pressure (BP) management, decreasing proteinuria, and avoiding the risks of long-term immunosuppressive management. Due to the slowly progressive nature of the disease, clinical trials are often underpowered, and conflicting information about management with non-immunosuppressive treatment is common. This is an update of a Cochrane review, first published in 2011. To assess the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatment for treating IgAN in adults and children. We aimed to examine all non-immunosuppressive therapies (e.g. anticoagulants, antihypertensives, dietary restriction and supplementation, tonsillectomy, and herbal medicines) in the management of IgAN. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to December 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of non-immunosuppressive agents in adults and children with biopsy-proven IgAN were included. Two authors independently reviewed search results, extracted data and assessed study quality. Results were expressed as mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects meta-analysis. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This review includes 80 studies (4856 participants), of which 24 new studies (2018 participants) were included in this review update. The risk of bias within the included studies was mostly high or unclear for many of the assessed methodological domains, with poor reporting of important key clinical trial methods in most studies. Antihypertensive therapies were the most examined non-immunosuppressive therapy (37 studies, 1799 participants). Compared to placebo or no treatment, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition probably decreases proteinuria (3 studies, 199 participants: MD - 0.71 g/24 h, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.39; moderate certainty evidence) but may result in little or no difference to kidney failure or doubling of serum creatinine (SCr), or complete remission of proteinuria (low certainty evidence). Death, remission of haematuria, relapse of proteinuria or > 50% increase in SCr were not reported. Compared to symptomatic treatment, RAS inhibition (3 studies, 168 participants) probably decreases proteinuria (MD -1.16 g/24 h, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.81) and SCr (MD -9.37 µmol/L, 95% CI -71.95 to -6.80) and probably increases creatinine clearance (2 studies, 127 participants: MD 23.26 mL/min, 95% CI 10.40 to 36.12) (all moderate certainty evidence); however, the risk of kidney failure is uncertain (1 study, 34 participants: RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.88; very low certainty evidence). Death, remission of proteinuria or haematuria, or relapse of proteinuria were not reported. The risk of adverse events may be no different with RAS inhibition compared to either placebo or symptomatic treatment (low certainty evidence). In low certainty evidence, tonsillectomy in people with IgAN in addition to standard care may increase remission of proteinuria compared to standard care alone (2 studies, 143 participants: RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.47) and remission of microscopic haematuria (2 studies, 143 participants: RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.53) and may decrease relapse of proteinuria (1 study, 73 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.85) and relapse of haematuria (1 study, 72 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98). Death, kidney failure and a > 50% increase in SCr were not reported. These trials have only been conducted in Japanese people with IgAN, and the findings' generalisability is unclear. Anticoagulant therapy, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines exhibited small benefits to kidney function in patients with IgAN when compared to placebo or no treatment. However, compared to standard care, the kidney function benefits are no longer evident. Antimalarial therapy compared to placebo in one study reported an increase in a > 50% reduction of proteinuria (53 participants: RR 3.13 g/24 h, 95% CI 1.17 to 8.36; low certainty evidence). Although, there was uncertainty regarding adverse events from this study due to very few events. Available RCTs focused on a diverse range of interventions. They were few, small, and of insufficient duration to determine potential long-term benefits on important kidney and cardiovascular outcomes and harms of treatment. Antihypertensive agents appear to be the most beneficial non-immunosuppressive intervention for IgAN. The antihypertensives examined were predominantly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. The benefits of RAS inhibition appear to outweigh the harms in patients with IgAN. The certainty of the evidence of RCTs demonstrating a benefit of tonsillectomy to patients with Japanese patients with IgAN was low. In addition, these findings are inconsistent across observational studies in people with IgAN of other ethnicities; hence, tonsillectomy is not widely recommended, given the potential harm of therapy. The RCT evidence is insufficiently robust to demonstrate efficacy for the other non-immunosuppressive treatments evaluated here.

[PMID: 37889557] The purpose of this review is to summarize the latest evidence on the prevention and progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), as well as novel pharmacological interventions from preclinical and early clinical studies with promising findings in the reduction of this condition's burden. We will cover the latest evidence on the reduction of proteinuria and kidney function decline in DKD achieved through established renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system blockade and the more recent addition of SGLT2i, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and GLP1-RA, that combined will most likely integrate the mainstay for current DKD treatment. We also highlight evidence from new mechanisms of action in DKD, including other haemodynamic anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic interventions, oxidative stress modulators and cell identity and epigenetic targets. Renal specific outcome trials have become more popular and are increasing the available armamentarium to diminish the progression of renal decline in patients at greater risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) such as diabetic individuals. A combined pharmaceutical approach based on available rigorous studies should include RAAS blockade, SGLT2 inhibitors, nonsteroidal MRA and expectedly GLP1-RA on a personalized based-intervention. New specific trials designed to address renal outcomes will be needed for innovative therapies to conclude on their potential benefits in DKD.

[PMID: 37539955] Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, is caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017. To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination. We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two other trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). We included three RCTs with 385 participants. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology, downgrading for risk of bias concerns, indirectness, and imprecision. Hydroxyurea versus placebo One RCT published in 2011 compared hydroxyurea to placebo in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. We are unsure if hydroxyurea compared to placebo reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate (mean difference (MD) 0.58 mL/min /1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76; 142 participants; very low certainty). Hydroxyurea compared to placebo may improve the ability to concentrate urine (MD 42.23 mOsm/kg, 95% CI 12.14 to 72.32; 178 participants; low certainty), and may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events, including acute chest syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 99% CI 0.13 to 1.16; 193 participants; low certainty), painful crisis (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.45 to 1.02; 193 participants; low certainty); and hospitalisations (RR 0.83, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 193 participants; low certainty). No deaths occurred in either trial arm and the RCT did not report quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo One RCT published in 1998 compared an ACEI (captopril) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if captopril compared to placebo reduces proteinuria (MD -49.00 mg/day, 95% CI -124.10 to 26.10; 22 participants; very low certainty). We are unsure if captopril reduces or prevents kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance; the trial authors stated that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but provided no comparative data (very low certainty). The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C One RCT published in 2020 compared an ACEI (lisinopril) with vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. It reported no data we could analyse. We are unsure if lisinopril compared to vitamin C reduces proteinuria in this population: the large drop in microalbuminuria in both arms of the trial after only one month on treatment may have been due to an overestimation of microalbuminuria at baseline rather than a true effect. The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if ACEI compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No RCTs assessed red blood cell transfusions or any combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although we found four ongoing trials since the last version of this review. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEIs or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.",10
Antidepressants increase the severity of migraines.,antidepressants AND effect AND migraine severity AND antidepressant impact,"39940388,38518587,37445267,35814300,35151971,34042166,33594686,32695028,25610528,41187385","[PMID: 39940388] The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia, a condition that causes chronic pain throughout the body, involves abnormal pain signaling, genetic predispositions, and abnormal neuroendocrine function, significantly impairing quality of life. Fibromyalgia is commonly characterized by musculoskeletal pain, chronic fatigue, and severe sleep alterations. Changes in the central processing of sensory input and defects in endogenous pain inhibition could be the basis of enhanced and persistent pain sensitivity in individuals with fibromyalgia. The term central sensitivity syndrome was chosen as an umbrella term for fibromyalgia and related illnesses, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome. Given the substantial impact of fibromyalgia on health, there is a need for new prevention and treatment strategies, particularly those involving bioavailable nutraceuticals and/or phytochemicals. This approach is particularly important considering the adverse effects of current fibromyalgia pharmaceutical treatments, such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants, which can lead to physical dependence and tolerance. Natural products have recently been considered for the design of innovative analgesics and antinociceptive agents to manage fibromyalgia pain. Polyphenols show promise in the management of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, especially considering how anti-inflammatory treatments, including corticosteroids and nonsteroidal medical drugs, are effective only when inflammatory processes coexist and are not recommended as the primary treatment for fibromyalgia.

[PMID: 38518587] sleep alterations strongly influence migraine severity. Prophylactic therapies have a major impact on migraine frequency and associated symptoms. The study purpose was to compare the impact of oral drug therapies or gene-related anti-calcitonin monoclonal antibodies (anti-CGRP mAbs) on sleep alterations. We also evaluated which drug therapies are more effective on sleep quality and the different impact on migraine frequency and life quality. this is a multicenter, prospective study conducted in three specialized headache centers (Marche Polytechnic University, Ancona; University of Palermo, Palermo; Fondazione Policlinico Campus Bio-Medico, Rome). At baseline, we assigned migraine patients to preventive therapy with first-line drugs or anti-CGRP mAbs. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) scales were administered. After three months, we re-evaluated the patients with the same scales. 214 patients were enrolled. Any prophylaxis was significantly associated with a reduction in PSQI score (mean difference 1.841; 95%CI:1.413-2.269; p < 0.0001), most significantly in the anti-CGRP mAb group (mean difference 1.49; 95%CI:2.617-0.366; p = 0.010). Anti-CGRP mAbs resulted in significant improvement in migraine severity and MIDAS scores. Among oral therapies, calcium antagonists and antidepressants were the most effective in reducing PSQI score between T0 and T1 (p = 0.042; p = 0.049; p < 0.0001, respectively). anti-CGRP mAbs revitalized the management of migraine with stable and well-documented efficacy. Our data also suggest that anti-CGRP mAbs result in a positive effect on sleep quality, with a significant improvement in PSQI scores. Knowing the relevant impact of sleep disruption on migraine severity, these data could help for the management of migraine patients.

[PMID: 37445267] Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is a common and debilitating consequence of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) that can occur over one year after the head impact event. Thus, better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and risk factors could facilitate early identification and management of PTH. There are several factors that could influence the reporting of PTH prevalence, including the definition of concussion and PTH. The main risk factors for PTHs include a history of migraines or headaches, female gender, younger age, greater severity of the head injury, and co-occurring psychological symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. PTH clinical profiles vary based on onset, duration, and severity: tension-type headache, migraine headaches, cervicogenic headache, occipital neuralgia, and new daily persistent headache. Pharmacological treatments often consist of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, or antiepileptic medication. Cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, biofeedback, and physical therapy could also be used for PTH treatment. Our work highlighted the need for more rigorous studies to better describe the importance of identifying risk factors and patient-centered treatments and to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing treatment options. Clinicians should consider a multidisciplinary approach to managing PTH, including pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes.

[PMID: 35814300] Migraine, one of the most common headaches in children, has a significant impact on children and their family's quality of life (QoL). There are two approaches for controlling migraine headaches preventative and controlling acute attacks. Several drugs have been used for this purpose, and tricyclic antidepressants were at the top. Amitriptyline has shown not only a desirable effect on controlling the headaches but also some adverse side effects. Recently, finding effective drugs with fewer side effects, become more critical. Among them, nutraceuticals were one of the promising ones. In this randomized clinical trial on 72 patients aged 5-15 years old with diagnosis of migraine based on the International Headache Society criteria, we compare the effectiveness of coenzyme Qten on frequency, duration, and severity of childhood migraine. For comparing the QoL, we used the International PedMIDAS questionnaire. Coenzyme Qten showed good therapeutic effects in children, especially in long-term use; however, amitriptyline showed more rapid response. After 3 months of treatment, clinical outcomes in the two groups did not significantly differ from each other. Similarly, Children's QoL increased in the same way. There are more reported side effects in children using amitriptyline compared to coenzyme Qten. According to results, Co-enzyme Q10, with fewer side effects and comparable therapeutic effects, especially in the long term, could be a good drug for prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches.

[PMID: 35151971] Migraine, as a primary headache, is among the leading causes of disability worldwide. The present study aimed at comparing the effects of venlafaxine (VLF) and amitriptyline (AMT) reducing the severity and the number of migraine attacks. Patients with complaints of migraine attacks were randomly divided into two groups. The first group received amitriptyline at a dose of 25 mg every night, and the second group received venlafaxine at a dose of 37.5 mg daily. The duration of treatment was eight weeks. Eighty patients participated in the current study, out of which 57.5% were females. The mean age of the participants was 33 years, and the mean duration of disease was eight years. Both amitriptyline and venlafaxine significantly reduced the number of attacks per month (AMT: from 10.98 to 2.98, VLF: from 9.98 to 3.18), and six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score (AMT: from 67.78 to 49.73, VLF: from 66.65 to 48.88), and no significant difference was observed between the two drugs. The results demonstrated no significant relationship between age or disease duration with the score of the HIT-6. The decrease rate in the score of the HIT-6 in males was higher than that of females which shows the modifier role of the gender. Besides, it is noteworthy to mention that the adverse effects of amitriptyline exceeded the venlafaxine among the patients. The effectiveness of AMT and VLF in terms of their potential to reduce the intensity and duration of headaches was more noticeable in male patients than female patients. In terms of adverse drug reactions, patients in the amitriptyline group complained more about adverse drug reactions (ADR) than patients in the venlafaxine group. It seems that in similar conditions, venlafaxine could have priority over amitriptyline in migraine prophylaxis.

[PMID: 34042166] Adherence to oral preventive treatment (OPT) in migraine is often compromised. The aim was to determine the degree of adherence to OPT in migraine patients at three months. We conducted a multicentre observational study of patients diagnosed with episodic or chronic migraine (criteria of the International Headache Classification, third edition) in whom OPT was initiated. Demographic data (age, gender, educational level, marital status) and disease data (number of attacks, Headache Impact Test-6 and Migraine Disability Assessment Scale scores) were collected. At three months, the Morisky-Green scale was administered, which differentiates levels of adherence: excellent (0), moderate (1-2) and low (3-4). Altogether 100 patients participated in the study: 87% women aged 42 ± 13 years, 14% with chronic migraine; 53.2% of them were beginning their first OPT. Beta-blockers were initiated in 23.2%, tricyclic antidepressants in 35.4%, flunarizine in 21.2%, neuromodulators in 19.2% and antihypertensives in 1%. Severe disability was observed in 56%, and the impact was very severe in 79.5%. Adhesion at three months was excellent in 41.8%, moderate in 28.6% and low in 29.6%. The most frequent reason for discontinuing was the occurrence of adverse effects (44%). A significant relationship was found between excellent adherence and being single (p = 0.046), and between low adherence and adverse effects (p = 0.009). No significant differences were found between the OPT used and the degree of adherence or the other variables studied. Although our results are better than those published in the literature, we consider that therapeutic adherence in our setting is low and educating our patients in this regard is a priority.

[PMID: 33594686] Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors were introduced in the United States (US) in 2018. To understand the changing patterns of preventive treatment following the introduction of these new agents, we must first characterize the patterns which preceded their introduction. To characterize the burden, unmet need, and treatment patterns in patients with migraine initiating preventive migraine medications before the introduction of CGRP inhibitors in the US. Between March 2016 and October 2017, we enrolled episodic (EM) and chronic migraine (CM) patients initiating or changing preventive treatment at primary care or neurology clinic visits in the US, in a real-world observational study using a prospective cohort design. At baseline and monthly thereafter for 6 months, we collected data from study sites and patients on migraine frequency, treatment modifications, migraine impact on functioning, and work productivity for a descriptive analysis of migraine patient experience and treatment patterns. From the sample of 234 completers, 118 had EM (50.4%) and 116 had CM (49.6%). Mean age at enrollment was 41 years (SD = 12) and mean age at first migraine diagnosis was 22 years (SD = 11). Most participants were females (n = 204/234; 87.2%) and white (n = 178/234; 76.1%). The majority (n = 164/234; 70.1%) had not used preventive migraine treatment in the 5 years prior to enrollment (treatment naïve). At baseline, mean monthly migraine days were 9.6 days (SD = 5.0) for the preventive treatment naïve group and 12.4 days (SD = 7.0) for treatment experienced patients. The majority had severe Migraine Disability Assessment (Grade IV, total score ≥21), including 67.1% (n = 110/164) of the preventive treatment naïve and 77.1% (n = 54/70) of the preventive treatment experienced patients. Headache Impact Test total scores indicating severe impairment (score >59) occurred in 88.4% (n = 145/164) of the treatment naïve and 88.6% (n = 62/70) of treatment experienced patients. Mean work productivity loss as measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire in the subsample of employed patients was 53.3% loss. The most used acute medications at baseline were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (n = 124/234; 53.0%), acetaminophen-based products (n = 112/234; 47.9%), and triptans (n = 105/234; 44.9%). The most commonly initiated preventive treatments were topiramate (n = 100/234; 42.7%), tricyclic antidepressants (n = 39/234; 16.7%), beta-blockers (n = 26/234; 11.1%), and onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 24/234; 10.3%). Over the 6-month follow-up period, almost half of patients (n = 116/234, 49.6%) modified their preventive treatment and discontinued treatment (n = 88/312 total modifications; 28.2%) or modified their pattern of use by increasing, decreasing, or skipping doses (n = 224/312 total modifications; 71.8%), often without seeking medical advice. Avoiding side effects was the main reason reported among patients who discontinued (n = 52/88; 59.1%), decreased frequency or dose (n = 37/89; 41.6%), and skipped doses (n = 29/86; 33.7%). Perceived lack of efficacy was another frequent reason reported among those who discontinued (n = 20/88; 22.7%), decreased frequency or dose (n = 15/89; 16.9%), and skipped doses (n = 18/86; 20.9%). Despite initiation of preventive treatment and improvements observed in number of headache and migraine days, migraine patients continued to experience substantial disability, headache impact, and reduced productivity throughout the 6-month follow-up period. Prior to 2018, the burden of migraine was high for patients initiating preventive treatments. Despite having more than 9 days of migraine per month on average, the majority (70.1%) of patients initiating prevention had been treatment naïve, indicating underuse of preventive treatments. The preventive treatments used in this study were poorly tolerated and were reported by patients to lack efficacy, resulting in suboptimal adherence. The high discontinuation rates suggest that the preventive medications being offered during the period of the study did not meet the treatment needs of patients. In addition, the decisions by about half of patients to alter their prescribed treatment plan without consulting their provider can pose substantial health risks. These findings pertain to the broad set of preventive treatments initiated in this study and do not support inferences about individual preventive treatments, due to limitations in sample size. These findings suggest the need for more effective and better tolerated preventive treatment options.

[PMID: 32695028] Lack of proper consideration of the interaction between biological and environmental factors limits our understanding of the development of depression. Our cross-sectional study investigated whether recent stress influences the effect of affective temperaments on depressive symptoms. 1015 general population participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory to capture depressive symptoms, the List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire to assess recent stressors, and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis Pisa, Paris, and San Diego Autoquestionnaire to evaluate affective temperaments (TEMPS-A). Linear regression models were built to investigate the effect of temperament and stress on depression, temperament on stress, and the effect of temperament on depressive symptoms in different stress exposure groups. Recent life events and anxious, depressive, cyclothymic, and hyperthymic temperaments significantly predicted depressive symptoms, and cyclothymic, and hyperthymic temperaments significantly predicted recent life event exposure. While in case of mild stress all affective temperaments except irritable predicted depression, in case of moderate exposure only the effect of depressive, cyclothymic, and hyperthymic temperament, while in the high exposure group only the effect of anxious temperament was significant. All measures were based on self-report, and subjective impact of life events was not considered. This was a cross-sectional study with a correlational nature which does not allow for causative conclusions. The contribution of affective temperaments to depression is much higher compared to stress, and severity of exposure to life events influences the impact of affective temperaments on depressive symptoms, pointing to divergent pathways of emotional reactivity mediating the effects of stress on depression which can be exploited for prevention and treatment.

[PMID: 25610528] Patients with bipolar disorder are exceptionally challenging to manage because of the dynamic, chronic, and fluctuating nature of their disease. Typically, the symptoms of bipolar disorder first appear in adolescence or early adulthood, and are repeated over the patient's lifetime, expressed as unpredictable recurrences of hypomanic/manic or depressive episodes. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder in adults is reported to be approximately 4%, and its management was estimated to cost the US healthcare system in 2009 $150 billion in combined direct and indirect costs. To review the published literature and describe the personal and societal burdens associated with bipolar disorder, the impact of delays in accurate diagnosis, and the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of available pharmacologic therapies. The studies in this comprehensive review were selected for inclusion based on clinical relevance, importance, and robustness of data related to diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder. The search terms that were initially used on MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar were restricted to 1994 through 2014 and included ""bipolar disorder,"" ""mania,"" ""bipolar depression,"" ""mood stabilizer,"" ""atypical antipsychotics,"" and ""antidepressants."" High-quality, recent reviews of major relevant topics were included to supplement the primary studies. Substantial challenges facing patients with bipolar disorder, in addition to their severe mood symptoms, include frequent incidence of psychiatric (eg, anxiety disorders, alcohol or drug dependence) and general medical comorbidities (eg, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, migraine, and hepatitis C virus infection). It has been reported that more than 75% of patients take their medication less than 75% of the time, and the rate of suicide (0.4%) among patients with bipolar disorder is more than 20 times greater than in the general US population. Mood stabilizers are the cornerstone of treatment of bipolar disorder, but atypical antipsychotics are broadly as effective; however, differences in efficacy exist between individual agents in the treatment of the various phases of bipolar disorder, including treatment of acute mania or acute depression symptoms, and in the prevention of relapse. The challenges involved in managing bipolar disorder over a patient's lifetime are the result of the dynamic, chronic, and fluctuating nature of this disease. Diligent selection of a treatment that takes into account its efficacy in the various phases of the disorder, along with the safety profile identified in clinical trials and in the real world can help ameliorate the impact of this devastating condition.

[PMID: 41187385] First-generation Latinx immigrant youth face risks for experiencing unique immigration-related traumas, which could exacerbate their mental health. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of forced immigration-related family separation on the association between traditional adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) among Latinx immigrant youth from the Northern Triangle (NT; El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Primary surveys assessing forced immigration-related family separation, ACEs, and mental health were administered to a sample of NT immigrant youth (N = 172). Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the study aim. In main effects analysis, forced immigration-related family separation was significantly associated with depression (B = 2.11, CI = [0.11, 4.11], p = .039) and PTSD (B = 4.01, CI = [0.63, 7.40], p = .021) symptoms. ACEs were significantly associated with depression (B = 1.34, CI = [0.86, 1.81], p < .001), anxiety (B = 1.05, CI = [0.63, 1.47], p < .001), and PTSD (B = 2.17, CI = [1.37, 2.97], p < .001) symptoms. In moderation effects analysis, the association of ACEs on depression (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.18, -0.25], p = .014), anxiety (B = -1.00, CI = [-1.86, -0.13], p = .024), and PTSD (B = -2.23, CI = [-3.84, -0.62], p = .007) symptoms was significantly attenuated among youth who experienced forced immigration-related family separation. Study findings may underscore the need to consider the inclusivity of immigration-related trauma in ACE assessment tools.",10

Under antibiotic pressure, bacteria may opt to shed their cell walls and transform into L-form state as a means to evade the antibiotic effects. In this study, we explored and identified diverse optimal conditions for both Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli DH5α (CTX)) and Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis ATCC6633), which were induced to L-form bacteria using lysozyme (0.5 ppm) and meropenem (64 ppm). Notably, when bacteria transformed into L-form state, both bacterial strains showed varying degrees of increased resistance to antibiotics polymyxin E, meropenem, rifampicin, and tetracycline. E. coli DH5α (CTX) exhibited the most significant enhancement in resistance to tetracycline, with a 128-fold increase, while B. subtilis ATCC6633 showed a 32-fold increase in resistance to tetracycline and polymyxin E. Furthermore, L-form bacteria maintained their normal metabolic activity, combined with enhanced oxidative stress, served as an adaptive strategy promoting the sustained survival of L-form bacteria. This study provided a theoretical basis for comprehending antibiotic resistance mechanisms, developing innovative treatment strategies, and confronting global antibiotic resistance challenges.

[PMID: 37094669] During COVID-19 pandemic, chemicals from excessive consumption of pharmaceuticals and disinfectants i.e., antibiotics, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), and trihalomethanes (THMs), flowed into the urban environment, imposing unprecedented selective pressure to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To decipher the obscure character pandemic-related chemicals portrayed in altering environmental AMR, 40 environmental samples covering water and soil matrix from surroundings of Wuhan designated hospitals were collected on March 2020 and June 2020. Chemical concentrations and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles were revealed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and metagenomics. Selective pressure from pandemic-related chemicals ascended by 1.4-5.8 times in March 2020 and then declined to normal level of pre-pandemic period in June 2020. Correspondingly, the relative abundance of ARGs under increasing selective pressure was 20.1 times that under normal selective pressure. Moreover, effect from QACs and THMs in aggravating the prevalence of AMR was elaborated by null model, variation partition and co-occurrence network analyses. Pandemic-related chemicals, of which QACs and THMs respectively displayed close interaction with efflux pump genes and mobile genetic elements, contributed >50 % in shaping ARG profile. QACs bolstered the cross resistance effectuated by qacEΔ1 and cmeB to 3.0 times higher while THMs boosted horizon ARG transfer by 7.9 times for initiating microbial response to oxidative stress. Under ascending selective pressure, qepA encoding quinolone efflux pump and oxa-20 encoding β-lactamases were identified as priority ARGs with potential human health risk. Collectively, this research validated the synergistic effect of QACs and THMs in exacerbating environmental AMR, appealing for the rational usage of disinfectants and the attention for environmental microbes in one-health perspective.

[PMID: 32247035] Salmonella is an important pathogen for public health due to food poisoning and acute infectious intestinal disease by zoonotic trait. We isolated Salmonella enterica QH which represents the normal growth condition in Luria-Bertani culture and displays a wide range of susceptibility for multiple antibiotics. To further investigate genetic and pathogenic traits of S. enterica QH, the sequencing genome of S. enterica QH and oral Salmonella infection in mice were performed in this study. Compared with other Salmonella strains, several large sequences containing prophages and genomic islands were inserted into S. enterica QH genome. Furthermore, nucleotide and synonymous codon usage patterns display mutation pressure and natural selection serving as drivers for the evolutionary trend of S. enterica QH at gene level. The unique codon usage pattern of S. enterica QH probably contributes to adaptation to environmental/host niches and to pathogenicity. In an early oral S. enterica QH infection, the levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes significantly reduce in peripheral blood of mice, but the increasing transcription levels of some cytokines (IFN-β1, IFN-γ and CXCL10) might have pleiotypic immune effects against S. enterica QH infection. Of note, IL10 displays significant enhancement at levels of transcription and translation, suggesting that immunosuppressive effects mediated by IL10 may function as an early oral S. enterica QH infection. The systemic investigations, including genomic and genetic characterizations and biological traits of S. enterica QH in vivo and in vitro may reflect the basic lifestyle of S. enterica QH, requiring intestine colonization, undergoing environmental stresses and performing dissemination.

[PMID: 31375490] Contamination of food during processing is recognized as a main transmission route of <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> To prevent microbial contamination, biocides are widely applied as disinfectants in food processing plants. However, there are concerns about the development of antimicrobial resistance in foodborne pathogens due to widespread biocide usage. In our study, 93 <i>L. monocytogenes</i> isolates from German food production facilities were (i) tested for biocide and antibiotic susceptibility using broth microdilution assays, (ii) analyzed for links between reduced biocide susceptibility and antibiotic resistance, and (iii) characterized by whole-genome sequencing, including the detection of genes coding for biocide tolerance, antibiotic resistance, and other virulence factors. Fifteen <i>L. monocytogenes</i> isolates were tolerant to benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and genes conferring BAC tolerance were found in 13 of them. Antibiotic resistance was not associated with biocide tolerance. BAC-tolerant isolates were assigned to 6 multilocus sequence type (MLST) clonal complexes, and most of them harbored internalin A pseudogenes with premature stop codons or deletions (<i>n</i> = 9). Our study demonstrated a high genetic diversity among the investigated isolates including genotypes that are frequently involved in human infections. Although <i>in vitro</i> adaptation studies to biocides have raised concerns about increasing cross-resistance to antibiotics, our results do not provide evidence for this phenomenon in field isolates.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Foodborne pathogens such as <i>L. monocytogenes</i> can persist in food production environments for a long time, causing perennial outbreaks. Hence, bacterial pathogens are able to survive cleaning and disinfection procedures. Accordingly, they may be repeatedly exposed to sublethal concentrations of disinfectants, which might result in bacterial adaptation to these biocides. Furthermore, antibiotic coresistance and cross-resistance are known to evolve under biocide selection pressure <i>in vitro</i> Hence, antimicrobial tolerance seems to play a crucial role in the resilience and persistence of foodborne pathogens in the food chain and might reduce therapeutic options in infectious diseases.

[PMID: 29245065] Kidney has a vital role in renal clearance, maintenance of blood pressure, elimination of toxic products and formation of prostaglandins. Certain medications are known to cause renal injury on its frequent usage and high dosage. Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which is used in the treatment of pain and arthritis. Madhuca longifolia is a deciduous tree which is known to the have anti-microbial, anti-ulcer, hepatoprotective, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the beneficial effect of aqueous leaf extract of Madhuca longifolia against DFC-induced renal toxicity in female Wistar albino rats. Thirty female Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups and the drugs were administrated specifically on each group. After the treatment period, the rats were sacrificed to evaluate the significant changes in renal enzyme markers, antioxidant activities in kidney tissue homogenate and plasma, renal histopathology and protein expression levels. The cytokines like TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β were measured through ELISA techniques and the levels of Caspase-3, COX-2 and NF-κB were measured through western blotting techniques. DiscussionMadhuca longifolia was observed to show a better result in normalizing the toxicity caused by diclofenac. The significant result of the aqueous leaf extract ofMadhuca longifolia was due to its ability in restoring renal function by restoring antioxidants and preventing cellular damages.

[PMID: 41187385] First-generation Latinx immigrant youth face risks for experiencing unique immigration-related traumas, which could exacerbate their mental health. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of forced immigration-related family separation on the association between traditional adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) among Latinx immigrant youth from the Northern Triangle (NT; El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Primary surveys assessing forced immigration-related family separation, ACEs, and mental health were administered to a sample of NT immigrant youth (N = 172). Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the study aim. In main effects analysis, forced immigration-related family separation was significantly associated with depression (B = 2.11, CI = [0.11, 4.11], p = .039) and PTSD (B = 4.01, CI = [0.63, 7.40], p = .021) symptoms. ACEs were significantly associated with depression (B = 1.34, CI = [0.86, 1.81], p < .001), anxiety (B = 1.05, CI = [0.63, 1.47], p < .001), and PTSD (B = 2.17, CI = [1.37, 2.97], p < .001) symptoms. In moderation effects analysis, the association of ACEs on depression (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.18, -0.25], p = .014), anxiety (B = -1.00, CI = [-1.86, -0.13], p = .024), and PTSD (B = -2.23, CI = [-3.84, -0.62], p = .007) symptoms was significantly attenuated among youth who experienced forced immigration-related family separation. Study findings may underscore the need to consider the inclusivity of immigration-related trauma in ACE assessment tools.

[PMID: 41187384] Treatment for gaming disorder (GD) can be challenging due to comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.",10
Antiretroviral therapy increases rates of tuberculosis across a broad range of CD4 strata.,antiretroviral therapy AND tuberculosis AND CD4 strata AND immune reconstitution,"29547445,28084192,41187210,41187204,41187188,41187123,41187020,41186900,41186896,41186782","[PMID: 29547445] To assess incidence, determinants and clinical consequences of suboptimal immune recovery in HIV-1 infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa with sustained viral suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Multicountry prospective cohort. Suboptimal immune recovery was defined as proportions of participants who failed to attain clinically relevant CD4+ cell count thresholds (>200, >350 and >500 cells/μl) despite sustained viral suppression on continuous first-line ART. Participants were censored at the earliest of death, loss to follow-up, last viral load less than 50 copies/ml, or database closure. Determinants of immune recovery were assessed using multivariable Cox regression. We estimated incidence rates of AIDS, pulmonary tuberculosis and all-cause mortality for CD4+ strata. One thousand, five hundred and ninety-two participants were included; 60% were women, median age was 37 years (IQR 31-43) and median pre-ART CD4+ cell count was 147 cells/μl (IQR 76-215). After 6 years of ART, suboptimal immune recovery at CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/μl, less than 350  cells/μl, and less than 500 cells/μl occurred in 7, 27, and 57% of participants, respectively. Compared with participants with CD4+ cell count greater than 500 cells/μl, on-ART incidence rates were 12.5, 4.1, 0.9 times higher for AIDS and 16.9, 3.5, and 2.3 times higher for pulmonary tuberculosis in participants with CD4+ cell count less than 200, 200-349, and 350-499 cells/μl, respectively. All-cause mortality was highest in participants with CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells/μl, and comparable across the higher CD4+ strata. Older age, male sex, and lower pre-ART CD4+ cell count were strongly associated with suboptimal immune recovery. These findings warrant close clinical and laboratory monitoring until adequate immune reconstitution is achieved and support early ART initiation before decline of CD4+ cell count.

[PMID: 28084192] The modulation of tuberculosis (TB)-induced immunopathology caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 coinfection remains incompletely understood but underlies the change seen in the natural history, presentation, and prognosis of TB in such patients. The deleterious combination of these two pathogens has been dubbed a ""deadly syndemic,"" with each favoring the replication of the other and thereby contributing to accelerated disease morbidity and mortality. HIV-1 is the best-recognized risk factor for the development of active TB and accounts for 13% of cases globally. The advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has considerably mitigated this risk. Rapid roll-out of ART globally and the recent recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) to initiate ART for everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count should lead to further reductions in HIV-1-associated TB incidence because susceptibility to TB is inversely proportional to CD4 count. However, it is important to note that even after successful ART, patients with HIV-1 are still at increased risk for TB. Indeed, in settings of high TB incidence, the occurrence of TB often remains the first presentation of, and thereby the entry into, HIV care. As advantageous as ART-induced immune recovery is, it may also give rise to immunopathology, especially in the lower-CD4-count strata in the form of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome will continue to impact the HIV-TB syndemic.

[PMID: 41187210] Diagnostic tests that can detect pre-clinical or sub-clinical infection, are one of the most powerful tools in our armoury of weapons to control infectious diseases. Considerable effort has been paid to improving diagnostic testing for human, plant and animal diseases, including strategies for targeting the use of diagnostic tests towards individuals who are more likely to be infected. We use machine learning to assess the surrounding risk landscape under which a diagnostic test is applied to augment its interpretation. We develop this to predict the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis incidents in cattle herds, exploiting the availability of exceptionally detailed testing records. We show that, without compromising test specificity, test sensitivity can be improved so that the proportion of infected herds detected improves by over 5 percentage points, or 240 additional infected herds detected in one year beyond those detected by the skin test alone. We also use feature importance testing for assessing the weighting of risk factors. While many factors are associated with increased risk of incidents, of note are several factors that suggest that in some herds there is a higher risk of infection going undetected.

[PMID: 41187204] Transmission-dynamic models are commonly used to study infectious disease epidemiology. Calibration involves identifying model parameter values that align model outputs with observed data or other evidence. Inaccurate calibration and inconsistent reporting produce inference errors and limit reproducibility, compromising confidence in the validity of modeled results. No standardized framework exists for reporting on calibration of infectious disease models, and an understanding of current calibration approaches is lacking. We developed the Purpose-Inputs-Process-Outputs (PIPO) framework for reporting calibration practices and applied it in a scoping review to assess calibration approaches and evaluate reporting comprehensiveness in transmission-dynamic models of tuberculosis, HIV and malaria published between January 1, 2018, and January 16, 2024. We searched relevant databases and websites to identify eligible publications, including peer-reviewed studies where these models were calibrated to empirical data or published estimates. We identified 411 eligible studies encompassing 419 models, with 74% (n = 309) being compartmental models and 20% (n = 81) individual-based models (IBMs). The predominant analytical purpose was to evaluate interventions (71% of models, n = 298). Parameters were calibrated mainly because they were unknown or ambiguous (40%, n = 168), or because determining their value was relevant to the scientific question beyond being necessary to run the model (20%, n = 85). The choice of calibration method was significantly associated with model structure (p-value<0.001) and stochasticity (p-value = 0.006), with approximate Bayesian computation more frequently used with IBMs and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo with compartmental models. Regarding reporting comprehensiveness, all PIPO framework items were reported in 4% (n = 18) of models; 11-14 items in 66% (n = 277), and 10 or fewer items in 28% (n = 124). Implementation code was the least reported, available in only 20% (n = 82) of models. Reporting on calibration is heterogeneous in recent infectious disease modeling literature. Our proposed framework for reporting of calibration approaches could support improved reproducibility and credibility of modeled analyses.

[PMID: 41187188] Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a diverse group of environmental microorganisms, most non-pathogenic. Most people come into contact with NTM during their lives. Still, the infection occurs in people with previous lung comorbidities, weakened immune systems, and the elderly. This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with NTM. The research was conducted in the form of a retrospective study, which included 23 patients with a diagnosis of NTM who were treated at the Clinic for Tuberculosis and Interstitial Lung Diseases of the Institute of Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina in Sremska Kamenica from 2014 to 2023. Patients were predominantly male (15, 65.2%). The most common type of NTM was Mycobacterium xenopi in 8 patients (34.8%), as well as the way of establishing the diagnosis in patients who had negative direct microscopy and culture confirmation (12, 52.2%), followed by positive direct microscopy and culture confirmation (10, 43.5%). Smokers were the most frequent (10, 55.6%). The most common comorbidity was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10, 43.5%). A statistically significant difference was found in the frequency of the method of proof across different types of non-tuberculous mycobacterium infections (Fisher's exact test = 21.928; p = 0.006). Fatal outcomes were seen in 17.6% of patients. A detailed history, evaluation of clinical features, radiological findings, and microbiological samples are required in patients with suspected NTM infection. Raising suspicion and speeding up diagnostic procedures in these patients is of great importance for the timely initiation of treatment and reduction of mortality.

[PMID: 41187123] Tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) is increasingly offered to people living with HIV in high-burden settings, including adolescents and young people (AYPLHIV). Evidence demonstrates that AYPLHIVs' HIV treatment engagement is improved by the provision of tailored support. How to effectively adapt this support to accommodate multimorbidity care, such as TPT alongside ART, warrants attention to deliver sustained optimal outcomes. We conducted qualitative research to better understand AYPLHIVs' experiences when initiating TPT and their related support needs. Peer counsellors (18-24 years) who were offered TPT within routine HIV care participated in two focus groups (n = 16 participants) and in-depth interviews (n = 12) in Harare. Iterative data collection and thematic analysis was conducted September 2023 to February 2024. TPT was presented by healthcare workers as uncomplicated and routine. This contrasted with participants' accounts of the significant disruptive and challenging experience of taking up TPT. This tension led many to stop TPT without support. Those who completed treatment were motivated by personal circumstances (e.g., recently witnessing severe TB illness, pregnancy); however, taking up and completing subsequent courses of TPT was not assured. TPT side effects and stigma led many to discontinue treatment, even when these were not personally experienced. Side effects recalled past experiences of HIV-stigma and discrimination, and undermined ART adherence, HIV viral suppression, and positive mental health. Introducing additional life-protecting treatments can have complicating biosocial effects, with consequences for individuals and public health. To support multimorbidity prevention and care, we outline five principles to guide initiating and maintaining treatment that acknowledges and responds to AYPLHIVs' dynamic immunological and social realities: Supported and safe relationships; Tailored messaging; Adaptable support; Respect for agency and autonomy; Timing: plan, review, revise (START). START emphasises investing in consistent peer support throughout adolescence, and centring AYPLHIVs' agency, embodied knowledge and wellbeing to ensure they are informed decision-makers about their health.

[PMID: 41187020] Some individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have acquired multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of HIV and/or are nonadherent to antiretroviral (ARV) medication. Injectable ARVs can provide salvage therapy for those with limited therapeutic options, and may be preferred by some people with HIV (PWH). Real-world evidence may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the barriers to adherence and the utility of injectable ARVs in PWH. Currently there is a lack of data on combined use of injectable ibalizumab (IBA) and lenacapavir (LEN) with optimized background regimen (OBR). A retrospective observational study examined medical charts from people living with MDR HIV-1 across eight facilities in the USA. All PWH used a combination of both IBA + LEN ± OBR for at least 6 months. Viral loads (VL) and CD4+ counts were collected. A total of 21 PWH were included. Four-class resistance at baseline was reported in 38.1% of PWH. Within 12-24 weeks of combined IBA + LEN treatment, a median reduction of -2,710 copies/mL HIV-1 RNA was observed. Median increase to CD4+ count was 67.5 cells/mm3 within 4-44 weeks of treatment initiation. Few intolerances required changes to treatment. Therapy with IBA + LEN continued for an average of 30 months and 20 months, respectively. In this small group of individuals with MDR HIV who were heavily treatment-experienced and/or faced adherence challenges, the use of IBA + LEN ± OBR was well tolerated and led to clinically significant reductions in VL and improvements in CD4+ counts.

[PMID: 41186900] Achieving high-quality immune reconstitution (IR) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is directly associated with the patient's ability to resist infections, prevent tumor relapses, and suppress graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The status of CD4 + T cells is critical for reconstituting adaptive immunity after transplantation; however, the patterns of reconstitution and their influencing factors remain unclear. This retrospective cohort study involved 164 patients who underwent myeloablative allo-HSCT from April 2016 to May 2023. Based on the early post-transplantation CD4 + T cell counts, the cohort was divided into two groups: 73 patients with high-quality IR (HIR) and 34 patients with low-quality IR (LIR). LIR was associated with an increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation following transplantation. Plasma EBV viral load was monitored weekly using quantitative PCR for the first 100 days post-transplantation. The LIR group had a higher viral load at the time of the first EBV reactivation and a significantly earlier first reactivation compared to the HIR group. No significant differences were observed in overall survival, GVHD incidence, or relapse rates between the groups. A CD4 + T cell count of < 60 cells/μL within 30 days post-transplantation was associated with a higher incidence of EBV viremia compared to the control group. These findings suggest that early CD4 + T cell counts may serve as a predictive marker for post-transplant EBV infection.

[PMID: 41186896] Lung cancer is associated with one of the highest cancer-related mortality rates and is the second most prevalent cancer worldwide. Diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer has different challenges as in most cases, and it is often diagnosed late when metastatic spread is widely disseminated. The development of chemo- and radioresistance of lung cancer, as well as a lack of specific treatment, has resulted in a very high mortality and morbidity. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a group of RNAs with a wide spectrum of functions required for homeostasis. These RNAs modulate the expression of proteins posttranslationally and control the cell phenotype. Studies have shown that these RNAs could act as both oncogene and oncosuppressor, and due to their great therapeutic and diagnostic potential, recent studies have also focused on their use as biomarkers for early detection of cancers. Understanding the current findings in this field would help scientists to have an overview about different ncRNAs and their role in lung cancer progression. This chapter explores the landscape of ncRNA research related to lung cancer, highlighting the potential for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

[PMID: 41186782] Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a global health crisis, necessitating the development of novel therapeutics against multidrug-resistant pathogens. In this study, ten (10) hybrid imine-benzalacetophenone derivatives (7a-7j), incorporating pyridine and thiophene scaffolds, were synthesized and structurally characterized using FTIR, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, LC-MS, and elemental analysis. In vitro, antimicrobial screening demonstrated that compounds 7c and 7j displayed consistent and potent activity across Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and fungal pathogens, with compound 7c achieving MICs as low as 25 µg/mL. Compound 7c exhibited significant antitubercular activity with 96% inhibition at 25 µg/mL against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. A deep learning-based QSAR model, developed using a fully connected feedforward neural network trained on molecular descriptors (MolWt, LogP, TPSA, H-bond donors/acceptors, etc.), yielded predicted pMIC values closely matching experimental trends. SHAP analysis confirmed the multivariate contribution of key descriptors, validating the model's interpretability despite dataset constraints. SwissADME-based pharmacokinetic profiling confirmed high gastrointestinal absorption, low PAINS alerts, and compliance with Lipinski and Veber rules for drug-likeness. Compounds 7c and 7j demonstrated balanced lipophilicity, low skin permeability, and favourable ADMET characteristics, aligning with their firm biological profiles. Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities for 7c (- 11.55 kcal/mol with CYP51) and 7j (- 9.97 kcal/mol with InhA), with multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions at catalytically relevant sites. These interactions were consistent with observed antimicrobial profiles. These docking predictions were validated by 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations, which confirmed the structural stability of 7c and 7j in complex with CYP51, InhA, PBP2a, and DNA Gyrase B. RMSD and RMSF trajectories, indicated stable ligand retention and minimized flexibility at the binding interface, particularly for 7c with CYP51 and InhA, and for 7j with DNA Gyrase B. These results support 7c and 7j as promising lead candidates with dual antimicrobial potential, favourable drug-like properties, and broad-spectrum activity profiles.",10

Because glaucoma is asymptomatic in its early stages and can be challenging to diagnose clinically, it often remains undiagnosed until substantial vision loss has occurred. Efficient methods of glaucoma screening are therefore warranted for early detection of disease. Identification of risk factors for glaucoma - family history of glaucoma, older age, African or Asian ethnicities, raised intraocular pressure, and thin corneas - have helped inform guidelines on the recommended age at commencement and frequency of glaucoma screenings. A genetic predisposition or family history of glaucoma is one of the most important risk factors for the disease. However, an accurate family history cannot always be ascertained. Genetic testing for genes such as myocilin could help to identify high-risk individuals and, with further research, could even provide insight into individual patients' response to treatment. With the ongoing discovery of glaucoma-associated genes and the advent of polygenic risk scores to identify individuals at high risk of glaucoma, gene-based screening for glaucoma is becoming closer to realisation. In the meantime, regularly screening family members of people with existing glaucoma is an efficient way of detecting early glaucoma. Raising public awareness of glaucoma is also necessary to educate the general public on the key role of routine eye examinations and early disease detection. Future studies should be undertaken to explore efficient public health campaign methods for improving glaucoma awareness.

[PMID: 35157567] The World Health Organization's Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI) aims to support incorporation of amblyopia detection and treatment into health service provision. The aim of this study was to systematically review clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for amblyopia to inform the development of this package. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Global Index Medicus databases, guideline databases and professional body websites were searched for CPGs published in English between 2010 and 9th March 2020. Guidelines were assessed using the AGREE II tool. Five CPGs from North America published between 2017-2019 were identified. One CPG provided recommendations on amblyopia treatment and four focused on amblyopia detection and assessment. Non-specialist screening for amblyopic risk factors was recommended in children aged 3-5 years. At least one comprehensive eye examination was recommended for infants and children aged 0-5 years. Treatment recommendations consisted of refractive correction followed by occlusion or cycloplegic penalization. Additional evidence is required to compare the benefits and limitations of comprehensive eye examinations for asymptomatic children to those from screening programs. Identified CPGs were produced in high-resource countries and may not be readily applied in lower resource settings where the PECI has the greatest potential to improve service provision.

[PMID: 31917793] Dilated eye exams are the standard of care to detect advancing, vision threatening, but often asymptomatic retinopathy in a timely fashion, allowing for vision preserving treatments. Annual exam rates are suboptimal, especially in underserved populations. Although teleophthalmology programs tremendously improve annual exam rates in low income/under resourced settings, widespread adoption is limited. Using a mixed methods approach, three focus groups and individual interviews were conducted for patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 23) who had a teleophthalmology exam or a dilated eye exam. A survey and discussion assessed patients' perspectives and value of teleophthalmology, including willingness to pay (WTP). Financial, transportation, and motivational barriers to obtaining an annual dilated eye exam were identified. Patients greatly valued having primary care (PC) based teleophthalmology for its convenience and ability to detect disease to allow for timely treatment and would recommend such a service. Although their WTP was at least the amount of their usual copay, cost was universally cited as a concern. Having a conveniently offered PC based teleophthalmology exam was valued. Educating patients on the value and costs of having such exams may be helpful to encourage informed discussions on eye care, especially in low income, underserved populations. Our study is among the few to provide insight on the value and perceptions of teleophthalmology in US low income, urban minority populations needed to help increase uptake of this innovation. Using surveys followed by facilitated discussion allowed for richer and more varied responses.

[PMID: 30338671] To determine the sensitivity and specificity of school nurse screening for hypermetropia and convergence insufficiency exophoria (CIE) in schoolchildren. Near point of convergence and distance visual acuity with +2.00D lenses were measured in 2097 children (6-15 years) during standard school nurse screening in the municipality of Randers, Denmark. One hundred and ninety-four children with positive screening results (near point of convergence >10 cm and/or distance visual acuity improved or maintained with +2.00D) and 182 controls with negative screening results received a full vision assessment, including cycloplegic refraction and orthoptic evaluation. Sensitivity and specificity of screening was 0.75 and 0.69 for CIE and 0.59 and 0.87 for hypermetropia (≥+2.00), respectively. While precision of screening for CIE was significantly higher for symptomatic children aged 9-15 than for younger and asymptomatic children, precision of screening for hypermetropia was independent of age and presence of visually related symptoms. While precision of screening for CIE and hypermetropia (>+2.00) was low, additional vision evaluation of children older than 9 years with asthenopic symptoms identified most children with CIE with a low absolute number of false positives.

[PMID: 9522788] To assess whether population screening for impaired vision among older people in the community leads to improvements in vision. Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of population screening in the community that included any assessment of vision or visual function with at least 6 months' follow up. Adults aged 65 or over. Proportions with visual impairment in intervention and control groups with any method of assessing visual impairment. There were no trials that primarily assessed visual screening. Outcome data on vision were available for 3494 people in five trials of multiphasic assessment. All the trials used self reported measures for vision impairment, both as screening tools and as outcome measures. The inclusion of a visual screening component in the assessment did not result in improvements in self reported visual problems (pooled odds ratio 1.04:95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.22). A small reduction (11%) in the number of older people with self reported visual problems cannot be excluded. Screening of asymptomatic older people in the community is not justified on present evidence. Visual impairment in this age group can usually be reduced with treatment. It is unclear why no benefit was seen. Further work is needed to clarify what interventions are appropriate for older people with unreported impairment of vision.

[PMID: 41187342] The efficacy of artesunate + amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether + lumefantrine (AL) for treating malaria was investigated in Madagascar in 2020. A randomized parallel-group study was conducted at four health centers (Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, and Matanga in the southeastern region and Ankazomborona in the northwestern region). The therapeutic efficacy and safety of ASAQ and AL were assessed using the WHO protocol, with a 28-day follow-up period. Children aged 6 months to 14 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria were randomly assigned to receive either ASAQ or AL. Genotyping assays for the pfK13 gene were conducted on P. falciparum isolates obtained from dry blood samples collected on Day 0. Of 765 enrolled patients, 709 (92.7%) reached the study endpoint. Among the per-protocol population, crude adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rates were 99%, 99%, 100%, and 100% for Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, Matanga, and Ankazomborona, respectively, in the ASAQ group and 98%, 91%, 90%, and 100% for the same locations, respectively, in the AL group. Polymerase chain reaction-corrected ACPR rates were 100% for the ASAQ group at all study sites, whereas for the AL group, they were 98.8% in Antsenavolo, 97.6% in Vohitromby, 100% in Matanga, and 100% in Ankazomborona. Day 3 slide positivity rates were 0%, 1%, 1%, and 0% for Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, Matanga, and Ankazomborona, respectively. During follow-up, mild and moderate adverse events, including gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain and vomiting) and headache, were reported in 10.2% (72/709) of patients. Of 727 samples successfully analyzed for pfK13, no mutation associated with artemisinin resistance was observed. The study results reveal that ASAQ and AL remain safe and efficacious for treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Madagascar.

[PMID: 41187329] The prevalence and incidence of dementia are higher in migrants and those with low socioeconomic status (SES). Mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer a potentially scalable way to reduce dementia risk via risk factor modification. We co-designed the MIND-PRO app-an mHealth intervention targeting dementia risk factors through self-managed lifestyle changes and remote coaching-specifically designed for Dutch individuals with low SES and those with Turkish or South Asian Surinamese migration backgrounds. We focused on these migrant populations as they are the largest in the Netherlands and have the highest risk of developing dementia. In this qualitative study, we explored the needs and preferences of our target populations aged 50-75 years old at increased dementia risk by conducting semistructured interviews and focus groups. Participant feedback was used to iteratively refine and adapt a prototype intervention based on insights from prior mHealth trials. We interviewed 23 participants (median age 59, IQR 55-63 y; n=15, 65% female) and conducted two focus groups with 7 Turkish women and 13 Dutch participants with low SES. The target populations emphasized personalization features such as goal setting, self-tracking, educational material, and remote coaching. Participants highlighted the importance of social interaction and autonomy in achieving sustainable lifestyle changes. Tailoring coaching and lifestyle advice to cultural practices was deemed beneficial. Optimal mHealth interventions targeting dementia risk factors in migrants and individuals with low SES should be personalized and interactive, respect autonomy, and integrate cultural needs and preferences.

[PMID: 41187325] Strabismus measurement is essential in vision assessment and screening. It typically requires skilled clinicians or specialized equipment. Photographic strabismus measurement methods have value in terms of accessibility and convenience of use. This study aimed to evaluate Eyeturn Cloud, a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) system for measuring strabismus angles based on eye images captured with smartphone cameras under cover test conditions. The Eyeturn Cloud web app uses AI models to recognize eyes, eye lid, and iris, and then to segment iris precisely. It then computes strabismus based on ellipse fitting of the iris boundary and corneal reflection. The system was evaluated in patients (without glasses) with manifest strabismus and control participants. Clinicians measured eye deviations using the prism alternate cover test and also captured pictures of their eyes under alternate cover and unilateral cover conditions. The pictures were processed by Eyeturn Cloud. In total, 79 (mean age 11.9, SD 6.3 years; esotropia: n=15, exotropia: n=55, orthotropia: n=9) participants were enrolled; of which, data were available for 71 participants (8/79, 10.1% processing failure). The range of prism alternate cover test strabismus magnitude was from 78 base in to 78 base out prism diopters (PDs). A strong correlation was found between Eyeturn Cloud and clinical measurements (R<sup>2</sup>=0.95; slope=0.91; P<.001). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that 95% limits of agreement between the 2 measurements were -20.2 to 14.6 PD. A repeatability test with 15 participants (4 photos each) found a 1.53 PD SD. The cloud AI web app can compute strabismus angles reliably under alternate and unilateral cover conditions in clinical settings, and its potential for use in telehealth settings needs further evaluation.

[PMID: 41187307] Vascular dysfunction contributes to Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRDs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies link midlife hemostasis and platelet aggregation measures to late-life dementia risk. We aimed to determine whether platelet aggregation in midlife is associated with imaging markers of AD pathology. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated associations between platelet aggregation, measured by light transmission aggregometry, and amyloid (<sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET uptake in dementia-free, middle-aged adults from the Framingham Heart Study. Co-primary outcomes included amyloid and tau uptake in AD-vulnerable regions. We also examined an MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk as a secondary outcome. We used multivariable regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, considering potential nonlinear associations. Platelet aggregation response was evaluated in 382 participants (mean age 56 ± 8 years, 53% female) approximately 1.2-1.5 years before amyloid and tau PET imaging. MRI data used for the AD signature were acquired together with PET imaging or within several months. The aggregation response exhibited a nonlinear association with AD pathology. Among those in the lowest tertile of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) response, platelet aggregation response was positively associated with increased amyloid in the precuneus (β = 0.047, <i>p</i> = 0.020) and tau in the rhinal (β = 0.077, <i>p</i> = 0.012), entorhinal (β = 0.066, <i>p</i> < 0.020), temporal global (β = 0.063, <i>p</i> = 0.031), and cortical (β = 0.064, <i>p</i> = 0.028) regions. For the secondary outcome analysis (n = 256), platelet aggregation response was negatively associated with the MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk (β = -0.002, <i>p</i> < 0.035), consistent with a neurodegenerative pattern. Our findings indicate that platelet aggregation is linked to PET and MRI markers of AD pathology as early as midlife. These findings support further investigation of platelet-mediated mechanisms in AD pathogenesis.

[PMID: 41187288] The prevalence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) has been primarily studied in East Asian countries; its prevalence in Western populations remains to be elucidated. We aimed to determine the prevalence of OPLL in a Chilean population aged 60 years and older using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and CT (PET-CT) as screening tool. We evaluated patients between 60 and 73 years consecutively studied with PET-CT in a University Hospital. We assessed whole-body CT scans in both sagittal and axial views to detect the presence of OPLL. We used the Mann-Whitney test to analyze continuous variables, the Fisher test for categorical variables, and a logistic regression analysis to determine the independent effect of age and sex on the presence of OPLL. We studied 1,009 patients (median age = 66 years); 597 were males (59.17%). Nineteen patients had OPLL, with a prevalence of 1.88% (1.04 to 2.72). OPLL was more prevalent in men (2.68%) than in women (0.73%; P = 0.02). All cases presented cervical involvement; only one had cervical and thoracic OPLL. The median age of patients with OPLL (64 years) and without OPLL (66 years) was not statistically different (P = 0.09). Male sex independently influenced the presence of OPLL (odds ratio = 3.85 [1.11 to 13.33]), age did not (odds ratio = 0.89 [0.78 to 1.02]). This is the first study evaluating the prevalence of OPLL in Latin America. It shows a prevalence alike that in non-Asian populations in the United States and lower than the prevalence described in Asian populations.",10
Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance.,autophagy deficiency AND liver AND insulin resistance AND metabolism,"40659123,40195072,40133024,39832563,39287864,38772366,38744890,38624096,38092813,37705071","[PMID: 40659123] Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common and severe complication of diabetes. Despite the availability of several drugs for the treatment of DN, there remains a need for novel therapeutic agents with more favorable risk profiles. Asiaticoside (AT) and asiatic acid (AA), two bioactive constituents derived from Centella asiatica, have exerted excellent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of AT and AA on DN remains unclear. To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AT and AA on DN in mice, a high-fat diet- and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice model was constructed to induce DN symptoms. AT and AA were then administered for 6 weeks to determine their impact on the progression of DN. The results indicated that AT and AA treatment improved insulin resistance and lipid metabolism while reducing inflammation in the liver and adipose tissue of DN mice. Additionally, AT and AA protected kidney function and alleviated kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Mechanistically, AT and AA mitigated podocyte damage by activating autophagy, and these effects were abrogated after autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine in vitro. AT and AA treatment protected gut barrier function, altered microbial composition and metabolites, and resulted in a reciprocal increase in beneficial bacteria and metabolites and a decrease in harmful ones. In summary, AT and AA administration ameliorated the progression of DN by activating podocyte autophagy and regulating microbiota dysbiosis, laying a theoretical basis for the nutritional intervention of AT and AA in DN.

[PMID: 40195072] Previous studies demonstrated that Tspo loss causes simple steatosis (SS) in hepatocytes in vitro. However, its effect on SS in vivo remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesise that Tspo loss promotes early-stage MASLD. WT and Tspo KO rats were fed a Gubra Amylin NASH (GAN) diet for 8 weeks to induce SS. Tspo KO rats fed the GAN diet (KO GAN) exhibited increased insulin resistance, higher plasma cholesterol, and elevated hepatic triacylglycerol (TAG) levels, along with higher de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and free fatty acid (FFA) uptake, evidenced by increased fatty acid synthase (FASN) and CD36 expression. The Acyl-coenzyme A binding protein/diazepam-binding inhibitor-TSPO complex facilitated FA transport to the mitochondria, where carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) directed them for β-oxidation. TSPO interacted with CPT1A in the outer mitochondrial membrane, while its depletion increased CPT1A expression, boosting FA oxidation. Primary Tspo KO rat hepatocytes and stably overexpressed CD36 (CD36_OE) in Huh7 cells displayed impaired mitochondrial function and compromised mitochondrial membrane potential. KO GAN livers had significantly elevated AcCoA, which acetylated RAPTOR, activating mTORC1 to suppress autophagy. Overall, Tspo deficiency exacerbates the advancement of SS by enhancing CD36-mediated FFA uptake, elevating AcCoA levels, compromising mitochondrial function and impairing autophagy during the early stages of MASLD.

[PMID: 40133024] Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the complications with the highest mortality among diabetes patients and can lead to renal failure. Modified Huangfeng decoction (MHD) has been widely applied in the clinical treatment of kidney diseases. However, the mechanism by which MHD affects DN has not been fully elucidated. To investigate the impact of MHD on DN in mice and the underlying mechanism. The main ingredients of MHD were identified by liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry. A high-fat diet- and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN mouse model was constructed and treated with MHD for 6 weeks. The serum and urine parameters were measured, and the tissue sections were histologically stained. The mRNA and protein levels of metabolism-, inflammation-, fibrosis-, and autophagy-related markers were examined by qPCR and western blotting. The microbial composition and metabolites of cecal contents were analyzed through full-length 16S rRNA sequencing and nontargeted metabolomics. MHD alleviated insulin resistance in DN mice and ameliorated changes in lipid metabolism and inflammation in the liver and fat. In addition, MHD reduced the levels of kidney injury markers in the serum and urine and attenuated inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney. These results were accompanied by enhanced gut barrier function and a markedly altered microbiota composition and metabolites, with an increased abundance of beneficial bacterial species and metabolites. Moreover, MHD itself and the microbial metabolite spermidine reduced podocyte damage by activating autophagy via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. MHD potentially ameliorated DN by activating podocyte autophagy via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and modulating the gut microbiota and its metabolites. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of MHD and the involvement of the gut‒kidney interaction in the progression of DN, laying a theoretical foundation for the clinical application of MHD in DN treatment.

[PMID: 39832563] Obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction is a major public health concern worldwide. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of metabolic dysfunction, and endothelial cells affect metabolic functions. Because autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) is involved in various cellular physiology, we investigated the roles of endothelial cell-ATG7 (EC-ATG7) on high-fat diet-induced obesity and its related metabolic dysfunction. We generated an endothelial-specific Atg7 knock-out mouse by breeding Atg7<sup>flox/flox</sup> mouse with the Chd5-Cre mouse, and investigated the metabolic phenotypes associated with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Body weight, food intake, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and liver fat accumulation were measured in endothelial Atg7 deficient (Atg7<sup>ΔEnd</sup>) and control mice (Atg7<sup>f/f</sup>). Adipose tissue inflammation was assessed by measuring the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, we performed indirect calorimetry and examined the insulin signaling pathway molecules. We found that deletion of EC-Atg7 ameliorated HFD-induced weight gain, fatty liver, and adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammatory response in adipose tissue, and improved insulin sensitivity without changing glucose tolerance. These metabolic effects seem to be due to the reduced food intake because there were no differences in energy expenditure, energy excretion to feces, and physical activity. Interestingly, the deletion of EC-Atg7 protected from HFD-induced vascular rarefaction, and the knock-down of Atg7 in endothelial cells protected from fatty acid-induced cell death. Our results suggest that EC-Atg7 deletion ameliorates HFD-induced obesity and its related metabolic dysfunction, such as insulin resistance and fatty liver by attenuating appetite and vascular rarefaction. The EC-Atg7 deletion may protect the endothelial cells from lipotoxicity and impaired angiogenesis, which preserves the endothelial function in metabolic tissues. These findings may have implications for developing new therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating obesity and its associated health risks.

[PMID: 39287864] Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is in parallel with the obesity epidemic, and it is the most common cause of liver diseases. The patients with severe insulin-resistant diabetes having high body mass index (BMI), high-grade adipose tissue insulin resistance, and high hepatocellular triacylglycerols (triglycerides; TAG) content develop hepatic fibrosis within a 5-year follow-up. Insulin resistance with the deficiency of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2)-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity causes an increase in intracellular fatty acid-derived metabolites such as diacylglycerol (DAG), fatty acyl CoA, or ceramides. Lipotoxicity-related mechanism of NAFLD could be explained still best by the ""double-hit"" hypothesis. Insulin resistance is the major mechanism in the development and progression of NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Metabolic oxidative stress, autophagy, and inflammation induce NASH progression. In the ""first hit"" the hepatic concentrations of diacylglycerol increase with an increase in saturated liver fat content in human NAFLD. Activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes are decreased in the liver tissue of patients with NASH. Hepatocyte lipoapoptosis is a critical feature of NASH. In the ""second hit,"" reduced glutathione levels due to oxidative stress lead to the overactivation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling that induces cell death in the steatotic liver. Accumulation of toxic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is caused at least by two ineffectual cyclical pathways. First is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oxidoreductin (Ero1)-protein disulfide isomerase oxidation cycle through the downstream of the inner membrane mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and the second is the Kelch like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathways. In clinical practice, on ultrasonographic examination, the elevation of transaminases, γ-glutamyltransferase, and the aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index indicates NAFLD. Fibrosis-4 index, NAFLD fibrosis score, and cytokeratin18 are used for grading steatosis, staging fibrosis, and discriminating the NASH from simple steatosis, respectively. In addition to ultrasonography, ""controlled attenuation parameter,"" ""magnetic resonance imaging proton-density fat fraction,"" ""ultrasound-based elastography,"" ""magnetic resonance elastography,"" ""acoustic radiation force impulse elastography imaging,"" ""two-dimensional shear-wave elastography with supersonic imagine,"" and ""vibration-controlled transient elastography"" are recommended as combined tests with serum markers in the clinical evaluation of NAFLD. However, to confirm the diagnosis of NAFLD, a liver biopsy is the gold standard. Insulin resistance-associated hyperinsulinemia directly accelerates fibrogenesis during NAFLD development. Although hepatocyte lipoapoptosis is a key driving force of fibrosis progression, hepatic stellate cells and extracellular matrix cells are major fibrogenic effectors. Thereby, these are pharmacological targets of therapies in developing hepatic fibrosis. Nonpharmacological management of NAFLD mainly consists of two alternatives: lifestyle modification and metabolic surgery. Many pharmacological agents that are thought to be effective in the treatment of NAFLD have been tried, but due to lack of ability to attenuate NAFLD, or adverse effects during the phase trials, the vast majority could not be licensed.

[PMID: 38772366] Adipose tissue group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) help maintain metabolic homeostasis by sustaining type 2 immunity and promoting adipose beiging. Although impairment of the ILC2 compartment contributes to obesity-associated insulin resistance, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here, we found that ILC2s in obese mice and humans exhibited impaired liver kinase B1 (LKB1) activation. Genetic ablation of LKB1 disrupted ILC2 mitochondrial metabolism and suppressed ILC2 responses, resulting in exacerbated insulin resistance. Mechanistically, LKB1 deficiency induced aberrant PD-1 expression through activation of NFAT, which in turn enhanced mitophagy by suppressing Bcl-xL expression. Blockade of PD-1 restored the normal functions of ILC2s and reversed obesity-induced insulin resistance in mice. Collectively, these data present the LKB1-PD-1 axis as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disease.

[PMID: 38744890] The prevalence of diabetes steadily increases worldwide mirroring the prevalence of obesity. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is activated in diabetes and contributes to β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis through the activation of a terminal unfolded protein response (UPR). Our results uncover a new role for Bax Inhibitor-One (BI-1), a negative regulator of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α) in preserving β-cell health against terminal UPR-induced apoptosis and pyroptosis in the context of supraphysiological loads of insulin production. BI-1-deficient mice experience a decline in endocrine pancreatic function in physiological and pathophysiological conditions, namely obesity induced by high-fat diet (HFD). We observed early-onset diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, reduced serum insulin levels, β-cell loss, increased pancreatic lipases and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the progression of metabolic dysfunction. Pancreatic section analysis revealed that BI-1 deletion overburdens unfolded proinsulin in the ER of β-cells, confirmed by ultrastructural signs of ER stress with overwhelmed IRE1α endoribonuclease (RNase) activity in freshly isolated islets. ER stress led to β-cell dysfunction and islet loss, due to an increase in immature proinsulin granules and defects in insulin crystallization with the presence of Rod-like granules. These results correlated with the induction of autophagy, ER phagy, and crinophagy quality control mechanisms, likely to alleviate the atypical accumulation of misfolded proinsulin in the ER. In fine, BI-1 in β-cells limited IRE1α RNase activity from triggering programmed β-cell death through apoptosis and pyroptosis (caspase-1, IL-1β) via NLRP3 inflammasome activation and metabolic dysfunction. Pharmaceutical IRE1α inhibition with STF-083010 reversed β-cell failure and normalized the metabolic phenotype. These results uncover a new protective role for BI-1 in pancreatic β-cell physiology as a stress integrator to modulate the UPR triggered by accumulating unfolded proinsulin in the ER, as well as autophagy and programmed cell death, with consequences on β-cell function and insulin secretion. In pancreatic β-cells, BI-1<sup>-/-</sup> deficiency perturbs proteostasis with proinsulin misfolding, ER stress, terminal UPR with overwhelmed IRE1α/XBP1s/CHOP activation, inflammation, β-cell programmed cell death, and diabetes.

[PMID: 38624096] Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme deficiency. Gaucher cells transformed from the macrophages by progressive sphingolipid accumulation and infiltrate bone marrow, spleen, liver, and other organs. The accumulation of substrate causes inflammation, compromised cellular homeostasis, and disturbed autophagy. It has been hypothesized that this proinflammatory state of GD leads cytokines and chemokines release. As a result of inflammatory process, the cellular dysfunction caused by disruption of cellular signaling, organelle dysfunction, or autoimmune antibodies may affect endocrine profile of GD patients such as hormone levels, lipid profile, and bone mineral density status. A total of 13 patients confirmed to have GD, 12 non-neuronopathic type and one subacute neuronopathic type, were enrolled in our study. The median treatment duration in the enzyme therapy was 13.33 years (9-26 years). At least one endocrinological abnormality was detected in blood tests of nine patients. Hyperinsulinism was the most common finding although fasting blood glucose levels HgbA1c levels were normal in all patients. Two patients had osteopenia, and osteoporosis was detected in two patients. Low HDL levels were detected in six patients, but HDL levels below 23 mg/dL associated with disease severity have been detected in two patients who have not receiving enzyme replacement therapy. None of patients had thyroidal dysfunction. This study had revealed endocrinological abnormalities in GD patients that have not led any severe morbidity in our patients. However, thyroid hormone abnormalities, insulin resistance, or lipid profile abnormalities may cause unpredictable comorbidities. Endocrinological assessment in GD patients in routine follow-up may prevent possible clinical manifestation in long term as well as can define efficacy of ERT on endocrine abnormalities.

[PMID: 38092813] T1D can be associated with metabolic disorders and several impaired pathways, including insulin signaling, and development of insulin resistance through the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The main precursor of RAS is angiotensinogen (Agt) and this system is often linked to autophagy dysregulation. Dysregulated autophagy has been described in T1D and linked to impairments in both glucose metabolism, and leukotrienes (LTs) production. Here, we have investigated the role of RAS and LTs in both muscle and liver from T1D mice, and its effects on insulin and autophagy pathways. We have chemically induced T1D in 129sve and 129sve 5LO<sup>-/-</sup> mice (lacking LTs) with streptozotocin (STZ). To further inhibit ACE activity, mice were treated with captopril (Cap). In muscle of T1D mice, treatment with Cap increased the expression of RAS (angiotensinogen and angiotensin II receptor), insulin signaling, and autophagy markers, regardless of the genotype. In the liver of T1D mice, the treatment with Cap increased the expression of RAS and insulin signaling markers, mostly when LTs were absent. 5LO<sup>-/-</sup> T1D mice showed increased insulin sensitivity, and decreased NEFA, after the Cap treatment. Cap treatment impacted both insulin signaling and autophagy pathways at the mRNA levels in muscle and liver, indicating the potential role of ACE inhibition on insulin sensitivity and autophagy in T1D.

[PMID: 37705071] Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent cause of chronic hepatic disease and results in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which progresses to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Although the Leptin deficient rodent models are widely used in study of metabolic syndrome and obesity, they fail to develop liver injuries as in patients. Due to the high similarity with humans, we generated Leptin-deficient (Leptin<sup>-/-</sup>) pigs to investigate the mechanisms and clinical trials of obesity and NAFLD caused by Leptin. The Leptin<sup>-/-</sup> pigs showed increased body fat and significant insulin resistance at the age of 12 months. Moreover, Leptin<sup>-/-</sup> pig developed fatty liver, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis with age. Absence of Leptin in pig reduced the phosphorylation of JAK2-STAT3 and AMPK. The inactivation of JAK2-STAT3 and AMPK enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation and leaded to mitochondrial autophagy respectively, and both contributed to increased oxidative stress in liver cells. In contrast with Leptin<sup>-/-</sup> pig, although Leptin deletion in rat liver inhibited JAK2-STAT3 phosphorylation, the activation of AMPK pathway might prevent liver injury. Therefore, β-oxidation, mitochondrial autophagy and hepatic fibrosis did not occurred in Leptin<sup>-/-</sup> rat livers. The Leptin-deficient pigs presents an ideal model to illustrate the full spectrum of human NAFLD. The activity of AMPK signaling pathway suggests a potential target to develop new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD.",10

The results showed that both ZME and imatinib promoted apoptosis in K562 and U266 cells, with combination treatment significantly enhancing apoptotic cell death (e.g., 18.4% apoptosis in K562 cells with ZME + imatinib vs. 8.5% untreated; 46.9% in U266 cells vs. 11.6% untreated, P < 0.05). Combined treatment with imatinib and ZME upregulated the expression of Bax (5-fold in K562, 3-fold in U266) and P-TEN (2-fold in K562, 2.8-fold in U266) genes and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 (0.3-fold in K562, 0.3-fold in U266), BCR-ABL (0.5-fold in K562), and c-MYC (0.4-fold in K562, 0.2-fold in U266) genes (P < 0.05). Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities between ZME constituents (carvacrol and thymol) and BCL-2 and ABL proteins. ZME shows potential as a complementary agent in vitro, warranting further investigation.

[PMID: 41074521] To observe the effects of ultrasound-guided foraminal electroacupuncture on neuronal apoptosis and motor function in rats with spinal cord injury (SCI), and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms. Thirty-six SPF-grade Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a sham operation group, a model group, and an ultrasound-guilded electroacupuncture group (electroacupuncture group), with 12 rats in each group. In the sham operation group, the spinal cord was exposed and then the incision was sutured without contusion. In the other two groups, SCI models were established using a modified Allen's impact method. On days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after modeling, the electroacupuncture group received electroacupuncture intervention at the T<sub>9</sub>/T<sub>10</sub> and T<sub>10</sub>/T<sub>11</sub> intervertebral foramen under ultrasound guidance, avoiding spinal cord injury. Stimulation parameters were dense-disperse wave at 2 Hz/100 Hz and 1-2 mA for each session. Following interventions on days 1, 3, 7, and 14, the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) score was assessed; the inclined plane test was used to assess hindlimb grip strength in rats. After the intervention, HE staining was used to observe spinal cord morphology; TUNEL staining was used to detect neuronal apoptosis; ELISA was used to measure the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α); Western blot was used to analyze the protein expression of Wnt-4, β-catenin, c-Myc, Bax, Bcl-2, and NeuN in spinal tissue; quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of Wnt-4, β-catenin, c-Myc, Bax, Bcl-2, and NeuN. Compared with the sham operation group, the model group showed significantly reduced BBB scores (<i>P</i><0.05), and reduced inclined plane angles (<i>P</i><0.05) at all time points. Compared with the model group, the electroacupuncture group exhibited increased BBB scores on days 3, 7, and 14 (<i>P</i><0.05), and higher inclined plane angles on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 (<i>P</i><0.05). Compared with the sham operation group, the model group showed disorganized spinal cord structure with increased inflammatory cells and necrotic neurons, higher number of apoptotic neurons in spinal tissue (<i>P</i><0.05), elevated serum IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels (<i>P</i><0.05), increased protein and mRNA expression of Wnt-4, β-catenin, c-Myc, and Bax (<i>P</i><0.05), and decreased protein and mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and NeuN in spinal tissue (<i>P</i><0.05). Compared with the model group, the electroacupuncture group had fewer inflammatory cells and apoptotic neurons in spinal tissue (<i>P</i><0.05), reduced serum IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels (<i>P</i><0.05), increased protein and mRNA expression of Wnt-4, β-catenin, Bcl-2, and NeuN (<i>P</i><0.05), and decreased protein and mRNA expression of c-Myc and Bax in spinal tissue (<i>P</i><0.05). Ultrasound-guided foraminal electroacupuncture could improve motor function in rats with SCI, potentially by regulating the expression of molecules related to the Wnt-4/β-catenin signaling pathway to inhibit neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory responses.

[PMID: 41028090] Natural plant active compounds can be applied to treat infected wounds due to their antibacterial and antioxidant properties. However, because of their degradable nature, these compounds must be coated in polymeric structures, such as chitosan (CS). Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are incorporated into CS to enhance its mechanical properties. This study investigated the effects of hydrogels prepared from CS/SWCNTs and linalool (CS/SWCNTs/Lin) on the treatment of infected wounds in a mouse model. The physicochemical properties of the prepared structures were examined, along with in vitro release, cytotoxicity, and antibacterial properties. Wound contraction, total bacterial count, histopathological parameters, and the expressions of BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2), Beclin-1, Caspase-3, c-Myc, Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), P53, superoxide dismutase (SOD), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and collagen type I (COL-1A), as well as serum concentrations of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were investigated. The physicochemical properties confirmed the successful synthesis of the structures, and CS/SWCNTs reduced the rapid release of linalool within the first 24 h. The results also confirmed the safety and antibacterial properties of the structures. The administration of hydrogels significantly reduced the total bacterial count and edema, accelerated the wound healing process, and increased the expression of Beclin-1, BCL-2, Caspase-3, c-Myc, GPx, SOD, P53, TGF-β, and collagen 1A, as well as the serum concentration of TAC compared to control groups. In summary, CS/SWCNTs/Lin hydrogels accelerated the wound healing process by influencing the expression of apoptotic molecules and antioxidant factors in an infected wound model in mice.

[PMID: 40889671] Phytochemical investigation of the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction from the 95 % ethanol extract of Cynanchum paniculatum (Bunge) Kitagawa roots and rhizomes led to the isolation of eight previously undescribed C<sub>21</sub> steroidal glycosides (1-8) designated cynapanosides H-O, alongside eighteen known analogues. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis using HRESIMS, 1D/2D NMR, and comparison with reported data. All isolated glycosides were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against HeLa and HepG2 cell lines. Among these, cynapanoside K (4) exhibited antiproliferative effects on HeLa cells by inducing apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle arrest. Mechanistic studies revealed that 4 downregulated Bcl-2, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 protein expression while activating Caspase-9, suggesting mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways contribute to its cytotoxic activity. This study expands the chemical diversity of bioactive C<sub>21</sub> steroidal glycosides and provides insights into their potential antitumor mechanisms.

[PMID: 40649963] Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains challenging to treat despite multimodal therapeutic approaches. Cisplatin treatment is effective and cost-efficient, although chemoresistance and disease recurrence limit its efficacy. Understanding the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance and the identification of compounds to target resistant tumor cells are critical for improving patient outcomes. We have demonstrated that cisplatin-induced senescent HN30 HNSCC cells can be eliminated by ABT-263 (navitoclax), a BCL-2/BCL-X<sub>L</sub> inhibitor that has senolytic properties. Here, we report the development of a cisplatin-resistant cell line (HN30R) for the testing of ABT-263 and the PROTAC BET degraders ARV-825 and ARV-771. ABT-263 was ineffective in sensitizing HN30R cells to cisplatin, largely due to a lack of senescence induction. However, the BET degraders in combination with cisplatin promoted apoptotic cell death in both HN30 and HN30R cells. The effectiveness of ARV-825 did not appear to depend on the cells entering into senescence, indicating that it was not acting as a conventional senolytic. ARV-825 treatment downregulated BRD4 and its downstream targets, c-Myc and Survivin, as well as decreased the expression of RAD51, a DNA repair marker. These results suggest that the BET degraders ARV-825 and ARV-771 may be effective in improving the response of chemoresistant head and neck cancer to cisplatin treatment.

[PMID: 40614544] Among female cancers, breast cancer is the most prevalent type with a high tendency for metastasis, which makes it compelling to develop new therapeutic modalities in the battle against this disease. For this purpose, a new series of theophylline-based derivatives was designed as dual STAT3/NF-B signaling pathway inhibitors. The most active three compounds (12a, 12b and 17b) exhibited potent inhibition of both STAT3 and NF-κB activation in 4 T1 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.22-8.21 μM. They also exerted considerable anticancer activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.53 to 7.68 μM in 4 T1, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. These compounds demonstrated their ability to inhibit breast cancer cell migration, and invasion in scratch and transwell assays, respectively. As a consequence of STAT3 inhibition, compound 12a was able to induce apoptosis via its effects on key apoptotic regulators; caspases-3,9, Bax and Bcl-2. Besides, western blotting of 12a-treated MDA-MB-231 cells confirmed decreased expression of STAT3, p-STAT3, Bcl-xl, c-Myc and NF-κB. Moreover, compound 12a reduced tumor volume in a comparable manner to 5FU in an Ehrlich solid carcinoma model. Docking of these compounds into the active sites of STAT3 and NF-κB revealed adequate binding patterns, providing further support for their effectiveness. Hence, these compounds proved to possess structural determinants that could be further tuned into more potent anticancer agents for breast cancer.

[PMID: 40613150] To investigate the effect of Arsenic trioxide (ATO) combined with Norcantharidin (NCTD) on the proliferation and apoptosis of Jurkat cells, and to evaluate its effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) based on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Jurkat cell lines were used as the study subjects and treated with different concentrations of ATO (0, 2, 4, 8, 16 μmol/L) and NCTD (0, 10, 25, 50, 100 μmol/L) for 72 hours, and the cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8. Meanwhile, flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis rate, EdU staining to detect cell proliferation viability, cell clone formation assay to assess cell cloning ability, Transwell assay to assess cell invasion ability, and Western blot to detect apoptosis and the expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins. Compared with the control group, both ATO and NCTD effectively inhibited Jurkat cell proliferation when used alone, and the inhibition effect was more significant when used in combination ( <i>P</i> < 0.05). The combination significantly increased the apoptosis rate of Jurkat cells ( <i>P</i> < 0.05). Meanwhile, the combination significantly decreased the proliferation vitality and clone formation ability of the cells ( <i>P</i> < 0.05), and inhibited the invasion ability of Jurkat cells ( <i>P</i> < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed that the combination of ATO and NCTD significantly up-regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and E-cadherin, and down-regulated the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, c-myc and Cyclin D1 ( <i>P</i> < 0.05). The combination of ATO and NCTD had a synergistic effect in inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis in Jurkat cells, which may be related to the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

[PMID: 40468424] This study investigates the molecular mechanism of action of F4B1, a novel oleanolic acid derivative in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. F4B1 is a naturally occurring oleanolic acid derivative that was isolated and purified from the leaves of Sesbania grandiflora. Structural analyses were carried out using 1D and 2D NMR, FT-IR, and mass spectrometric analyses. MTT assay was employed to evaluate antiproliferative effects in A549 (a model for lung cancer), MCF-7 (a model for breast cancer), HEP-2 (a model for head and neck cancer) and in MRC-5 (human lung fibroblast cells). Fluorescence staining, scanning electron microscopy, and flow cytometry were employed to study apoptosis and cell cycle. Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence techniques were followed to study the mechanisms of cell death. Schrodinger software was employed for docking studies. While preliminary screening was conducted in multiple cell lines, A549 cells were chosen for further mechanistic exploration based on their higher sensitivity to F4B1 treatment. F4B1 blocks the proliferation and causes intrinsic mode of cell death in lung adenocarcinoma cells. In particular, the above anticancer effect was mediated through a mechanism that is associated with the inactivation of NF-kappa B signaling and suppression of cyclin D1 expression leading to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase. Our study confirms that F4B1 induces apoptosis, as confirmed through Annexin V staining results. It is intrinsic apoptosis, as evidenced by upregulation of pro-apoptotic markers (BAX), downregulation of anti-apoptotic markers (BCL-2), cytochrome C release, activation of caspase-9, and caspase-3. These results establish the involvement of the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway. The pathway also involved the suppression of the proto-oncogene c-Myc both at the transcriptional and translational levels. Docking studies show that F4B1 has a high affinity binding towards CXCR4 and SRC kinase. Our findings specifically contribute to understanding the mechanism of F4B1, the isolated molecule from S. grandiflora, as an anticancer drug candidate and will hopefully pave the way toward further studies.

[PMID: 40321606] Cancer is a prevalent global disease affecting ~20 million individuals, and this burden causes the death of ~9.7 million people in 2024. The prevalence rate is continuously increasing due to exposure to harmful environmental and occupational contaminants (toxins and chemicals), compromised immune response, genetic modifications, and poor lifestyle and dietary practices. The management of cancer is challenging and demands cost-effective and safe therapeutic strategies. This review accentuates the anticancer potential of anthocyanins and its associated underlying mechanism. Anthocyanins, the active components extracted from grapes, berries, black chokeberries, eggplants, black currants, sweet cherries, strawberries, black grapes, plums, and red onions, hold antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential. The bioavailability of anthocyanins is a crucial factor in imposing their anticancer effect, and this bioavailability can be improved by microbial phenolic catabolites, provision of α-casein, and nano delivery systems. Anthocyanins hinder cell migration, invasion, and proliferation by inducing apoptosis, suppressing cell cycle at G0/G1, S, or G2/M stages, and modulating signaling pathways such as apoptotic cascades, PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB. Moreover, anthocyanins downregulate oncogenes (<i>Bcl-2</i>, <i>MYC</i>, and <i>HER2</i>) and improve the activity of tumor suppressor genes (<i>TP53</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, and <i>RB1</i>). Anthocyanins, particularly cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside, suppress inflammation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6) in colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, it causes cell cycle inhibition and mitochondrial dysfunction in ovarian and cervical malignancies. Although pre-clinical studies have proved anticancer activities, further clinical trials are required to validate its therapeutic impact and standard dose regimens.

[PMID: 40204952] The landmark discovery of the BCL-2 gene and then its function marked the identification of inhibition of apoptotic cell death as a crucial novel mechanism driving cancer development and launched the quest to discover the molecular control of apoptosis. This work culminated in the generation of specific inhibitors that are now in clinical use, saving and improving tens of thousands of lives annually. Here, some of the original players of this story, describe the sequence of critical discoveries. The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, frequently observed in follicular lymphoma, allowed the identification and the cloning of a novel oncogene (BCL-2) juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus (IgH). Of note, BCL-2 acted in a distinct manner as compared to then already known oncogenic proteins like ABL and c-MYC. BCL-2 did not promote cell proliferation but inhibited cell death, as originally shown in growth factor dependent haematopoietic progenitor cell lines (e.g., FDC-P1) and in Eμ-Myc/Eμ-Bcl-2 double transgenic mice. Following a rapid expansion of the BCL-2 protein family, the Abbott Laboratories solved the first structure of BCL-XL and subsequently the BCL-XL/BAK peptide complex, opening the way to understanding the structures of other BCL-2 family members and, finally, to the generation of inhibitors of the different pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, thanks to the efforts of Servier/Norvartis, Genentech/WEHI, AbbVie, Amgen, Prelude and Gilead. Although the BCL-2 inhibitor Venetoclax is in clinical use and inhibitors of BCL-XL and MCL-1 are undergoing clinical trials, several questions remain on whether therapeutic windows can be achieved and what other agents should be used in combination with BH3 mimetics to achieve optimal therapeutic impact for cancer therapy. Finally, the control of the expression of BH3-only proteins and pro-survival BCL-2 family members needs to be better understood as this may identify novel targets for cancer therapy. This story is still not concluded!",10
Bariatric surgery leads to negative outcomes in mental health.,bariatric surgery AND depression AND anxiety AND complications,"41087809,41085909,40933341,40665061,40613980,40611087,40327833,40309814,40275467,40111296","[PMID: 41087809] Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is used to achieve significant and sustained weight loss. Considerable MBS are performed on women of reproductive age, with limited data regarding risks and management pre-conception and peripartum. Our retrospective audit assessed adult women in pregnancy with prior MBS, attending a specialised, multidisciplinary obesity service between January 2018 and July 2022. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, including surgical data, anthropometry, nutritional status, and pregnancy outcomes were collected for each pregnancy and evaluated. Across 189 women and 210 pregnancies, pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI ≥ 30) prevalence was 55.9%, with polycystic ovarian syndrome and type 2 diabetes and depression and anxiety the most common associated medical and mental health problems, respectively. One-sixth of pregnancies were conceived within 12 months of MBS. Of those with available data (n = 174), only 43.1% (n = 75) had preconception dietitian reviews. Second trimester iron deficiency was noted in 64.1% (107/167) (parenteral supplementation required in 23.8% (50/210)) and vitamin B12 deficiency in 46.2% (61/132) (parenteral supplementation administered in 32.9% (69/210)). Maternal and neonatal complications occurred in 43.8% and 45.7% of pregnancies. Special care nursery (SCN) or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions were higher than background population rates. Women in pregnancy following MBS have complex medical and mental health backgrounds, limited pre-conception counselling and significant nutritional deficiencies, with higher rates of SCN/NICU admissions. Our study highlights the role of specialised pre-conception and perinatal services for these women.

[PMID: 41085909] Eating disorders among children and adolescents occur in all body sizes and must be properly identified and treated across settings for optimal health outcomes. This review summarizes considerations for behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical obesity treatment and eating disorder risk. Obesity and eating disorders share many common risk factors. Yet adolescents with obesity and eating disorders are underrepresented in research studies and often remain undiagnosed in medical practice despite presenting with more severe symptoms. There is evidence for reduction of subclinical disordered eating attitudes and behaviors in health behavior and lifestyle trials, with emerging evidence of reductions in subclinical disordered behaviors (i.e., loss of control eating) for patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. There is a paucity of eating disorder screening and monitoring data reported in pharmacological trials. Psychosocial outcomes, including subclinical eating disordered attitudes and behaviors, suicidality risk, and symptoms of depression and anxiety, should be continuously monitored prior to and throughout obesity treatment. There are several validated measures to detect symptoms of disordered eating among youth with higher weights. Early detection of eating disorder symptoms among obesity treatment-seeking youth is imperative to inform the course of comorbid treatment to occur simultaneously, sequentially, or within specialty care. Adolescents with obesity are at greater risk for engaging in disordered eating and related worsened mental and physical health outcomes compared to peers without obesity. It is vital to assess for eating disorder symptoms and presentation to inform timely treatment.

[PMID: 40933341] Long-term data on the efficacy and safety of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are still limited. Using a matched cohort design, we aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of RYGB and SG on individuals with T2DM, focussing on obesity- and surgery-related outcomes over a follow-up period of up to 14 years. A nationwide, matched, longitudinal study was conducted using data from the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR) and the Swedish Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg). Between 2007 and 2020, all individuals with T2DM who underwent primary surgery (RYGB = 7294 and SG = 1105) were identified through SOReg and matched by age, sex, and BMI to a control group of individuals with T2DM from NDR who had not undergone surgery (n = 8399). Data on all-cause mortality and obesity- and surgery-related outcomes after RYGB and SG were retrieved from national registers with almost complete coverage. Risks were expressed as incidence rates per 10,000 person-years and analysed using adjusted Cox regression models, which included duration of diabetes, yielding adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). During follow-up, the percentage total weight loss and reductions in HbA1c levels were significantly greater after RYGB and SG than in unexposed individuals (%TWL: RYGB 23·2 vs. 3·6 and SG 17·1 vs. 3·1 at two years, smd > 0·1) and (mean HbA1c: RYGB 46 (SD 14) vs. 58 (SD 17) and SG 46 (SD 13) vs. 55 (SD 15) at two years, smd > 0·1). RYGB was associated with sustainable reductions in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR of 0·62 (95% CI [0·51-0·71])) and obesity-related comorbidities, with risks as much as 45% lower compared to unexposed individuals (p < 0·001). However, individuals after RYGB face as much as a twofold increased risk of malabsorption and micronutrient deficiency (adjusted HR of 2·00 (95% CI [1·76-2·28])) and alcohol use disorder (adjusted HR of 2·82 (95% CI [2·37-3·36])), p < 0·001. The risk of other psychiatric disorders, such as depression (adjusted HR of 1·28 (95% CI [1·14-1·43])), and surgical complications, such as bowel obstruction (adjusted HR of 3·96 (95% CI [3·15-4·98])), was also higher after RYGB (p < 0·001). In contrast, the SG cohort showed no significant effects on obesity-related conditions and risk of surgical complications, despite similar weight reduction in both surgery groups. The study highlights the advantages and limitations of RYGB and SG, providing insights to guide an individualised approach. The limited efficacy of SG in lowering obesity-related disease risks should be a key consideration when selecting individuals with T2DM for surgery.

[PMID: 40665061] Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) effectively treats obesity in reproductive-age women and has been linked to improvements in pre-existing mental health conditions. However, during pregnancy, women with a history of MBS may still experience an increased risk of developing mental health issues, regardless of their status before surgery. This systematic review of seven studies, encompassing 4992 participants, revealed higher rates of antenatal depression (7.6%-38%) and anxiety (24.4%-64%) in post-MBS women. Marital status, psychiatric history, and weight loss were identified as contributing factors. The findings highlight the need for comprehensive mental health screening, fertility education, and targeted support for post-MBS women. Despite MBS's benefits in treating obesity and improving maternal and neonatal outcomes, the potential for increased mental health conditions necessitates a more holistic approach to care for this population.

[PMID: 40613980] Kidney transplantation represents the best therapy for kidney failure, but obesity can limit access to this therapeutic option. Therapeutic strategies, such as diet or bariatric surgery, should be considered for obese patients with kidney failure. Unfortunately, there are no guidelines available to manage obesity in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Reducing energy intake is necessary to manage obesity. This usually entails a protein intake of at least 1 g/kg of body weight, contrary to what is recommended by CKD guidelines. To date, bariatric surgery is the best strategy for weight loss, but is not indicated in some conditions, such as in patients with major mood disorders. We present the case of a woman with CKD stage G4A2, metabolic syndrome, and anxiety-depressive disorder. She was not eligible for transplantation because of morbid obesity, or for bariatric surgery due to her major mood disorder. An individualised ketogenic diet was prescribed to give her a chance to access the kidney transplantation waitlist. During the dietary treatment, there was no worsening of kidney function or any adverse effects, and the patient lost 11.7 kg. In selected cases, ketogenic diet could represent a rescue therapy for obese CKD patients allowing them access to the kidney transplantation program.

[PMID: 40611087] The prevalence of impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and some mental health complications, such as anxiety and depression, were previously reported to be higher in cases with obesity. However, the prevalence and changes before and after metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) are less well-defined in various populations of individuals with severe obesity. In this prospective study, the status of HRQOL, anxiety, and depression symptoms of 32 cases with severe obesity who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were investigated one month before and one year after surgery. The assessments were performed through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-lite (IWQOL-Lite) questionnaires. One year after surgery, Patients' average body mass index (BMI) decreased significantly by 9.14 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: -10.76; -7.52. At baseline, the incidence rates of probable/possible anxiety or depression disorders were 65.6% and 46.9%, respectively. However, these symptoms did not improve significantly after surgery. In contrast, HRQOL scores significantly improved across all domains. The point prevalence of mental health complications appears to be relatively higher among patients who underwent MBS compared to the general population. While the surgery effectively reduced weight and improved the HRQOL of patients, the impact on anxiety and depression was insignificant. Due to the small sample size, especially the limited number of patients with abnormal HADS scores, these findings should be interpreted cautiously.

[PMID: 40327833] Lipoabdominoplasty, primarily sought for cosmetic enhancement, has shown potential benefits beyond physical transformation. Emerging evidence suggests that aesthetic procedures may positively affect mental health by improving body image and self-esteem. This study aims to assess the impact of lipoabdominoplasty on pharmacologic therapy (ie, benzodiazepines) use in patients with preexisting depression or anxiety disorders. This prospective cohort study included 69 patients who underwent lipoabdominoplasty. All patients were taking benzodiazepines before surgery, with dosage frequency recorded. Follow-up assessments were conducted postoperatively to document changes in drug use and evaluate mental health improvements using validated scales, including the BODY-Q. A significant reduction in benzodiazepine use was observed postoperatively. At follow-up, 17% of patients discontinued medication, and 61% required a lower dosage ( P < 0.05). Complications occurred in 16% of cases, including seroma ( n = 6), infection ( n = 2), hematoma ( n = 2), and necrosis ( n = 1); 1 patient required reintervention. BODY-Q scores demonstrated significant improvements in body image and self-esteem. Lipoabdominoplasty may contribute to reduced drug use, likely driven by improvements in body image and psychologic well-being. These findings underscore the potential of aesthetic surgery to enhance mental health in patients with depression or anxiety, offering an integrated holistic care approach. Therapeutic, IV.

[PMID: 40309814] <b>Background/Objectives</b>: Obesity is a major public health challenge of the 21st century, with prevalence rates steadily rising globally. Disordered eating behaviors, particularly emotional eating (EE), complicate the clinical management of obesity and hinder long-term outcomes, such as maintaining weight loss after bariatric surgery. Studies reveal that EE affects 65-75% of overweight or obese adults, and such behavior may stem from a disrupted brain reward system linked to emotional dysregulation and impulsivity. Impulsivity in obesity involves deficient cognitive inhibitory control, creating an imbalance between impulsive and reflective systems. While problematic eating behaviors and obesity are well studied, the role of affective temperaments-innate traits influencing mood, energy, and responses to stimuli-remains underexplored. This study aims to examine the interplay between emotional eating, impulsivity, and affective temperaments in obese patients preparing for bariatric surgery. <b>Methods</b>: A total sample of 304 obese outpatients was consecutively enrolled at the Psychiatry Clinic of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine of the University of Pisa during the presurgical mental health evaluation routinely performed before the bariatric intervention. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected by psychiatrists during a single consultation. Assessments also included the following psychometric tests: the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-5), the Emotional Eating Scale (EES), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale-Version 11 (BIS-11), and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-Auto-questionnaire (TEMPS-A). <b>Results</b>: A significant correlation was observed between the EES total score and the BIS total score (<i>p</i> = 0.003), as well as with the sub-dimensions of attentional impulsivity (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and motor impulsivity (<i>p</i> = 0.024). In addition, a significant correlation has been found between the total score of EES and the cyclothymic (<i>p</i> < 0.001), depressive (<i>p</i> < 0.001), irritable (<i>p</i> = 0.013), and anxious (0.020) temperaments. When comparing obese patients with EE and without EE (No-EE), higher rates of both current (<i>p</i> = 0.007) and lifetime (<i>p</i> = 0.024) psychiatric comorbidities were observed in the EE group, namely for anxiety disorders (<i>p</i> = 0.008) and eating disorders (<i>p</i> = 0.014). <b>Conclusions</b>: Our study highlights a significant association between EE in obese patients with the cyclothymic, irritable, anxious, and depressive temperaments, and impulsivity dimension. Thus, problematic eating behaviors and temperamental traits may have a bidirectional psychopathological influence in obese patients and need to be carefully evaluated in subjects seeking bariatric surgery.

[PMID: 40275467] Bariatric surgery can lead to significant weight loss and improved physical health. Still, it often also brings about complex psychological effects, including changes in self-esteem, body image and emotional well-being that require careful monitoring and support. This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to analyse the relationship between bariatric surgery and postoperative improvement in psychiatric and eating disorders. MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE Library and other specialized databases were searched in July 2024. Observational studies included individuals who had undergone any bariatric surgical treatment with a preoperative evaluation of eating disorders, depression and anxiety and at a postoperative measure of the same variables selected. Thirteen studies that met the eligibility criteria were included for qualitative synthesis and eight studies for meta-analysis. Two reviewers independently screened for eligibility. The mean difference was calculated using the random-effects model. Bariatric surgery was found to be effective in improving eating disorders (-0.81%, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.05; I2 = 98%, p < .05), depression (-0.56, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.04, I2 = 97%, p < .03) and anxiety (-0.74, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.31, I2 = 94%, p < .00). The literature reveals high heterogeneity between studies, particularly in assessing psychological factors, with a common reliance on self-reported questionnaires rather than gold-standard assessments. Nonetheless, based on the findings of this study, there was a genuine effect on eating disorders, depression and anxiety when those participants underwent bariatric surgery.

[PMID: 40111296] Bariatric surgery is recognized as the most effective method for patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) or complicated obesity (BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/m² with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for at least one year). This article aims to examine the evolution of mental health after the procedure. Anxiety-depressive disorders and binge eating usually decrease within two years post-surgery. However, studies show an increased risk of alcohol or substance use disorders after surgery. Additionally, there has been an increase in self-harming and suicidal behaviors. In conclusion, bariatric surgery should be part of a personalized, multidisciplinary approach to ensure the best benefit-risk ratio for each patient.",10

Identifying non-invasive, early indicators of CRC risk remains essential and could help reduce its health burden. Excess adiposity and chronic inflammation are major predisposing factors for precancerous adenomatous polyposis (AP) and CRC, while diet- or surgery-induced weight loss was associated with a reduced risk. Viral infections also represent cancer risk factors through direct or synergic mechanisms, though no definitive causal link has been established for CRC. Moreover, interest is growing on the role of oral viruses as predictors of disease. <b>Methods</b>: In this study, highly sensitive and specific Luminex-based screening assays were used to perform a comprehensive characterization of oral infections by Human Herpes (HHV), Polyoma (HPyV) and Papilloma (HPV) Viruses in CRC patients (N = 50), healthy controls (N = 46; normal weight, NW = 26; overweight, OW = 20), and high-risk individuals with obesity (N = 35) or adenomatous polyposis (AP, N = 22). <b>Results</b>: We observed increased HPyV prevalence in AP, and higher single and multiple β-HPV infection rates in AP and CRC compared to controls. A panel of β-HPV genotypes, including oncogenic HPV5, was overrepresented in CRC and high-risk groups, and some of them showed an association with the male sex. The prevalence of most infections decreased in the obese cohort following bariatric surgery, alongside weight loss and reduction of inflammatory markers. Furthermore, oral infections by viral types previously detected in CRC tissue and adjacent mucosa also declined after surgery. <b>Conclusions</b>: Altogether, these findings suggested a role for oral β-HPV types as potential sex- and lifestyle-related, modifiable indicators of cancer risk.

[PMID: 40944359] While obesity is linked to increased cancer risk, evidence on the impact of intentional weight loss on obesity-associated cancers (OACs) is limited. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to assess the association between intentional weight loss and cancer incidence, including overall cancers and 13 OACs, from recent observational studies and clinical trials. Studies published between January 2019 and May 2023 were searched within MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Studies assessing the relationship between intentional weight loss, defined as weight reduction via metabolic-bariatric surgery (MBS) or lifestyle interventions, and cancer incidence were included. A dual independent review process was used to screen 1954 abstracts and 84 full-text articles, and to extract data from 18 full studies. All discrepancies were resolved by another reviewer. Of the 18 studies included, 17 studies were observational, focusing on MBS as the method for achieving weight reduction. One randomised controlled trial examined the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention on weight reduction and found no significant association between intentional weight loss and cancer risk. Intentional weight loss was associated with decreased cancer incidence in 71.4% (n = 5/7) of studies for all cancers and 66.7% (n = 4/6) of studies for OACs, with reported risk reductions of 11% to 33% and 11% to 41%, respectively. For specific OACs, a greater number of studies indicated that weight reduction was associated with reduced occurrence of endometrial (4/4, 100%, 31%-53% risk reduction), female breast (5/9, 55.6%, 19%-50% risk reduction) and colorectal (4/7, 57.1%, 20%-60% risk reduction) cancers. This SLR highlights the potential cancer risk-reduction benefit of weight reduction for people with obesity.

[PMID: 40599584] Both obesity and diabetes are associated with increased risk for specific types of cancer, generally termed obesity-related cancer (ORC). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS) are well established treatments for diabetes and obesity, but their comparative effectiveness for the prevention of ORC is unknown. Here, we compare the incidence of ORC in adults living with obesity and diabetes who were treated with first-generation GLP-1RA or with BMS. An observational, retrospective cohort study based on electronic medical records data of Clalit health services, Israel. The study included patients aged ≥24 years, with obesity and diabetes, with no prior history of ORC, who received either of the interventions during 2010 through 2018. Overall, 3178 pairs were matched 1:1 based on sex, age, baseline BMI, time of treatment initiation, and smoking status. The study period extended from January 2010 until December 2023. The measured outcome was the incidence of ORC, defined as any of the following diagnoses: multiple myeloma, meningioma, adenocarcinoma of esophagus; stomach, colorectal, liver or bile duct, gallbladder, pancreas, corpus uteri, ovary, renal-cell kidney, thyroid, and postmenopausal breast cancer. Of the 6356 study participants, 3884 (61.1%) were females. At baseline, the mean age was 52.3 years (SD: 9.28), and the mean BMI was 41.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD: 5.10). Participants were followed for a median of 7.5 years and up to 12.9 years. ORC occurred in 5.62 cases per 1000 person-years in BMS patients, and in 5.89 cases per 1000 person-years in GLP-1Ra patients; adjusted HR for GLP1-RA versus BMS 1.11 (95% CI: 0.86-1.44). Moreover, assessment of mediation through weight-loss resulted in an estimated direct effect of 41% (95% CI: 15%-59%) relative risk reduction of the pharmacotherapy. Our finding suggest that first-generation GLP1-RA treatment does not increase ORC risk in patients receiving GLP1-RA treatment for diabetes and weight loss. Moreover, this may point at additional pathways beyond weight loss in which GLP-1RAs might contribute to the decreased risk for ORC, such as reducing inflammation. However, future studies, including randomized controlled trials and larger prospective cohort studies are needed to validate the observed effects and explore the underlying mechanisms. No financial or in-kind support was provided for the conduct of this study.

[PMID: 40561000] Obesity is a global epidemic characterized by energy disequilibrium, metabolic disorders, and fat mass development that greatly affect the health status of individuals. There is evidence that the intake of a high-fat diet and overweight are associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). Metabolic surgery has been associated with improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and a reduction in the overall cancer risk. However, the underlying mechanism by which metabolic surgery reduces the risk of CRC remains unknown. To understand the antitumoral mechanism of bariatric surgery, we analyzed the development of CRC after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in an RYGB-CRC mouse model. Here, we showed that RYGB surgery substantially reduced primary tumorigenesis and prevented metastasis. This protective effect was mediated by bile acid (BA) exclusion from the proximal small intestine, leading to BA diversion in the preceding parts of the gastrointestinal tract and in circulation. The diverted BA profile in RYGB mice showed antitumoral and antimetastatic effects that were verified by BA exclusion of the proximal small bowel without the systemic metabolic installations of RYGB surgery by a cholecystointestinal shunt (CIS) surgery. RYGB surgery thus leads to reduced primary BAs and elevated secondary BAs in circulation. In a translational study involving patients with CRC with metachronous liver metastases, we confirmed that reduced primary BA concentrations in the serum were associated with prolonged time to metastasis, underscoring the critical role of BAs in CRC progression and metastatic development.

[PMID: 40277890] Cancer risk increases by 25 to 250% not only in dysmetabolic obese or overweight people with overt type 2 diabetes but also in individuals with intermediate hyperglycemia (pre-diabetes), with especially pronounced risk of pancreatic or hepatocellular cancer and obesity-related cancers, e.g., colorectal and kidney cancers, bladder cancer in men, and endometrial and breast cancers in women. Cancer may often be present before or upon the diagnosis of diabetes, as there is a common pathogenetic dysmetabolic-inflammatory background with insulin resistance for developing diabetes, cardiorenal disease, and cancer in parallel. The mechanisms involved relate to hyperinsulinemia as a potential carcinogenic priming event with ectopic visceral, hepatic, pancreatic, or renal fat accumulation that subsequently fuel inflammation and lipo-oncogenic signals, causing mitochondrial oxidative stress and deregulation. Moreover, hyperinsulinemia may foster mitogenic MAP kinase-related signaling, which can also occur via IGF1 receptors due to increased free IGF1 levels in obesity. Weight reduction of 10% or more in obese people with diabetes or pre-diabetes, e.g., through intensive lifestyle intervention or bariatric (=metabolic) surgery or through treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists or metformin, is associated with significantly lower incidence of ""diabesity""-associated cancers. In conclusion, there seems to be huge utility in adopting the new ""Cardio-Renal-Metabolic-Cancer Syndrome"" approach, also looking for cancer at the time of diabetes diagnosis in addition to proactively screening for undiagnosed dysglycemia.

[PMID: 40002265] <b>Introduction</b>: Obesity is a chronic disease associated with increased risk for several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The majority of CRC cases are associated with modifiable risk factors. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is a proven, durable, and successful intervention for obesity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of MBS on CRC risk through measures of association, such as relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR). <b>Methods</b>: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Embase was conducted to identify systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses examining the relationship between obesity treated with MBS and CRC incidence. The PICO framework guided inclusion criteria, and three independent reviewers screened articles using Rayyan software. Quality assessment was performed using AMSTAR2. <b>Results</b>: Of 1336 screened articles, 10 SR met inclusion criteria, encompassing 53,452,658 patients. Meta-analyses consistently showed a significant reduction in CRC risk following MBS in patients with severe obesity. Risk reductions were reported by Liu et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.32-0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.01), Chierici et al. (RR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.28-0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.018), Wilson et al. (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.003), and Pararas et al. (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. For colon cancer, Liu and Chierici both reported an RR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.46-1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.2444) with significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 89%). A trend towards reduced rectal cancer risk (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.40-1.39, <i>p</i> = 0.3523) was noted but limited by fewer studies. Sex-specific analyses revealed protective effects in both sexes, with a more pronounced impact in females (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.37-0.79, <i>p</i> = 0.0014). <b>Conclusions</b>: This umbrella review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of MBS on CRC risk, highlighting a consistent protective association. The findings also indicate a potential risk reduction for both colon and rectal cancer, with a more pronounced effect observed among females compared to males. Given the profound implications of MBS on cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, further high-quality, long-term studies are essential to deepen our understanding and optimize its role in cancer prevention and patient care.

[PMID: 38272606] There is debate over whether the glycaemic index of foods relates to chronic disease. We aimed to assess the associations between glycaemic index (GI) and glycaemic load (GL) and type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, diabetes-related cancers, and all-cause mortality. We did a meta-analysis of large cohorts (≥100 000 participants) identified from the Richard Doll Consortium. We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for cohorts that prospectively examined associations between GI or GL and chronic disease outcomes published from database inception to Aug 4, 2023. Full-article review and extraction of summary estimates data were conducted by three independent reviewers. Primary outcomes were incident type 2 diabetes, total cardiovascular disease (including mortality), diabetes-related cancers (ie, bladder, breast, colorectal, endometrial, hepatic, pancreatic, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and all-cause mortality. We assessed comparisons between the lowest and highest quantiles of GI and GL, adjusting for dietary factors, and pooling their most adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates using a fixed-effects model. We also assessed associations between diets high in fibre and whole grains and the four main outcomes. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023394689. From ten prospective large cohorts (six from the USA, one from Europe, two from Asia, and one international), we identified a total of 48 studies reporting associations between GI or GL and the outcomes of interest: 34 (71%) on various cancers, nine (19%) on cardiovascular disease, five (10%) on type 2 diabetes, and three (6%) on all-cause mortality. Consumption of high GI foods was associated with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes (RR 1·27 [95% CI 1·21-1·34]; p<0·0001), total cardiovascular disease (1·15 [1·11-1·19]; p<0·0001), diabetes-related cancer (1·05 [1·02-1·08]; p=0·0010), and all-cause mortality (1·08 [1·05-1·12]; p<0·0001). Similar associations were seen between high GL and diabetes (RR 1·15 [95% CI 1·09-1·21]; p<0·0001) and total cardiovascular disease (1·15 [1·10-1·20]; p<0·0001). Associations between diets high in fibre and whole grains and the four main outcomes were similar to those for low GI diets. Dietary recommendations to reduce GI and GL could have effects on health outcomes that are similar to outcomes of recommendations to increase intake of fibre and whole grain.

[PMID: 38059440] Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is the most effective intervention for weight loss leading to significant resolution of obesity-related medical conditions. Recent literature has demonstrated risk reduction of certain cancer types after MBS. Studies have shown an overall reduction in the risk of hormonal cancer, such as breast and endometrial cancer. However, the association between bariatric surgery and the incidence of various types of non-hormonal cancer such as esophageal, gastric, liver, gallbladder, colorectal, pancreatic and kidney cancer remains contested. The aim of this study was to highlight obesity and its relationship to cancer development as well as bariatric surgery and its role in cancer reduction with focus on non-hormonal cancers.

[PMID: 37969715] Colorectal cancer ranks third in global cancer prevalence and stands as the second leading cause of cancer-related mortalities. With obesity recognized as a pivotal risk factor for colorectal cancer, the potential protective role of bariatric surgery, especially laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, has garnered attention. To investigate the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) <i>vs</i> sleeve gastrectomy (SG) effect on colorectal cancer incidence in obese individuals. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Seventeen studies with a total of 12497322 patients were included. The primary outcome was the relative risk (RR) of developing colorectal cancer in obese patients who underwent weight loss surgery compared to those who did not. Secondary outcomes included determining the RR for colon and rectal cancer separately and subgroup analyses by gender and type of weight loss surgery. The meta-analysis revealed a 54% reduction in colorectal cancer risk in morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared to those who did not. A significant 46% reduction in colorectal cancer risk was observed among female patients. However, no significant differences were found in the meta-analysis for various types of bariatric surgery, such as SG and RYGB. This meta-analysis reveals weight loss surgery, regardless of type, reduces colorectal cancer risk, especially in women, as indicated by RR and hazard ratio assessments. Further validation is essential.

[PMID: 37341934] Cancer and obesity represent two of the most significant global health concerns. The risk of malignancy, including colorectal cancer (CRC), increases with obesity. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the value of bariatric surgery in reducing CRC risk in patients with obesity using registry data. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per PRISMA guidelines. The risk of CRC was expressed as a dichotomous variable and reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel-Haenszel method. A multi-treatment comparison was performed, examining the risk reduction associated with existing bariatric surgery techniques. Analysis was performed using RevMan, R packages, and Shiny. Data from 11 registries including 6,214,682 patients with obesity were analyzed. Of these, 14.0% underwent bariatric surgery (872,499/6,214,682), and 86.0% did not undergo surgery (5,432,183/6,214,682). The mean age was 49.8 years, and mean follow-up was 5.1 years. In total, 0.6% of patients who underwent bariatric surgery developed CRC (4,843/872,499), as did 1.0% of unoperated patients with obesity (54,721/5,432,183). Patients with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery were less likely to develop CRC (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36-0.77, P < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 99%). Patients with obesity undergoing gastric bypass surgery (GB) (OR: 0.513, 95% CI: 0.336-0.818) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (OR: 0.484, 95% CI: 0.307-0.763) were less likely to develop CRC than unoperated patients. At a population level, bariatric surgery is associated with reduced CRC risk in patients with obesity. GB and SG are associated with the most significant reduction in CRC risk. CRD42022313280.",10

Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective treatment modality for obesity. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the incidence of breast cancer in those who underwent bariatric surgery, as well subgroup analysis focusing on the effect of menopausal status in this cohort. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, involving the search of databases including Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, Pubmed and Google Scholar. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (Revman) Version 5.4. A total of 2,288,003 patients with obesity were included in the analysis. There was a statistically significant risk reduction in breast cancer incidence in those who underwent bariatric surgery compared to those who did now (RR 0.58 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.46, 0.72, p < 0.001) across all fourteen studies. There was significant heterogeneity across the studies (Chi<sup>2</sup> = 358 p < 0.00001, I<sup>2</sup> = 96 %). Further subgroup analysis was performed on four of the included studies regarding the impact of menopausal status on breast cancer incidence. There was no statistically significant reduction in premenopausal breast cancer risk (RR 0.88 95 % CI 0.74, 1.04). The result was similar in the postmenopausal cohort (RR 0.46 CI 95 % 0.18, 1.19). This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that bariatric surgery is associated with a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer incidence by pathways alluded to in this review and likely by a number of mechanisms yet to be fully elucidated. The role of menopausal status on breast cancer incidence in those who undergo bariatric surgery remains unclear.

[PMID: 40552446] Obesity and breast cancer rates are increasing globally, with obesity prevalence more than doubling since 1990. By 2022, 44% of women were overweight, and 18% were obese. Breast cancer remains the most common malignancy among women, with 2.2 million new cases in 2020. A significant proportion of breast cancer patients are overweight or obese at diagnosis, which is associated with higher recurrence and mortality rates. Recently, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have emerged as remarkably effective weight loss drugs. Understanding the relationship between obesity, breast cancer, and weight loss is crucial for improving patient outcomes. A comprehensive review of literature from 1996 to 2024 was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science. Studies included epidemiological data on obesity and breast cancer incidence, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical trials on weight management interventions (behavioral modification, bariatric surgery, and pharmacological treatments) for breast cancer patients. Preclinical studies examining the biological mechanisms linking obesity and breast cancer progression were also reviewed. Epidemiological studies consistently show that overweight and obese post-menopausal women have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Obesity at diagnosis is linked to worse outcomes, including higher disease recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. Weight gain during treatment, particularly with chemotherapy, is common and often leads to sarcopenic obesity. Behavioral interventions have shown modest weight loss but are difficult to maintain. Bariatric surgery reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but lacks data on its impact on tumor characteristics and recurrence. GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide have demonstrated significant weight loss in non-cancer populations, but their safety and efficacy in breast cancer patients are not well established. The biology underlying obesity's role in breast cancer progression involves complex interactions between adipocytokines, hormones, and inflammatory cytokines. Weight loss interventions have potential benefits, but sustaining weight reduction in breast cancer patients is challenging. The emerging pharmacological treatments, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists, show promise for effective weight management but require further investigation to confirm their safety and impact on breast cancer outcomes. Addressing obesity in breast cancer patients is critical for improving prognosis and quality of life. While current data do not suggest adverse safety signals with GLP-1 receptor agonists, more research is needed to fully understand their effects. Effective, safe, and sustainable weight management strategies are urgently needed to support breast cancer patients.

[PMID: 32309417] Obesity is second only to tobacco as a preventable cause of cancer in the US. By multifactorial and often additive mechanisms, obesity leads to the development and promotion of 40% of the cancers diagnosed in this country, including post-menopausal breast, endometrial, colorectal, kidney, liver and pancreatic cancers, among others. Though prevention of obesity should be the ultimate goal of thoughtful and effective healthcare practices, it remains a highly prevalent condition, and morbid obesity (BMI ≥40 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>) can be refractory to lifestyle interventions in many cases. Currently bariatric surgery is an effective treatment strategy for individuals who suffer from morbid obesity or obesity with associated co-morbidities and fail to lose weight under a medically supervised diet and exercise program. The current review addresses seminal studies that have investigated the potential cancer prevention effects of bariatric surgery, demonstrating a positive impact mostly in post-menopausal breast and endometrial cancers. The controversial association between bariatric surgery and increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is also recognized and discussed. Finally, while bariatric surgery should not be routinely recommended as a cancer prevention strategy, it has the potential to decrease the risk for certain types of cancers as a collateral beneficial effect.

[PMID: 30195656] Mammographic breast density (BD) is an independent risk factor for breast cancer. The effects of bariatric surgery on BD are unknown. To investigate BD changes after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). University hospital, United States. Fifty women with mammograms before and after SG performed from 2009 to 2015 were identified after excluding patients with a history of breast cancer, hormone replacement, and/or breast surgery. Patient age, menopausal status, co-morbidities, hemoglobin A1C, and body mass index were collected. Craniocaudal mammographic views before and after SG were interpreted by a blinded radiologist and analyzed by software to obtain breast imaging reporting and data system density categories, breast area, BD, and absolute dense breast area (ADA). Analyses were performed using χ<sup>2</sup>, McNemar's test, t test, and linear regressions. Radiologist interpretation revealed a significant increase in breast imaging reporting and data system B+C category (68% versus 54%; P = .0095) and BD (9.8 ± 7.4% versus 8.3 ± 6.4%; P = .0006) after SG. Software analyses showed a postoperative decrease in breast area (75,398.9 ± 22,941.2 versus 90,655.9 ± 25,621.0 pixels; P < .0001) and ADA (7287.1 ± 3951.3 versus 8204.6 ± 4769.9 pixels; P = .0314) with no significant change in BD. Reduction in ADA was accentuated in postmenopausal patients. Declining breast area was directly correlated with body mass index reduction (R<sup>2</sup> = .4495; P < 0.0001). Changes in breast rather than whole body adiposity better explained ADA reduction. Neither diabetes status nor changes in hemoglobin A1C correlated with changes in ADA. ADA decreases after SG, particularly in postmenopausal patients. Software-generated ADA may be more accurate than radiologist-estimated BD or breast imaging reporting and data system for capturing changes in dense breast tissue after SG.

[PMID: 27986574] Morbidly obese women are at increased risk for breast cancer, and the majority of surgical weight-loss patients are older than 40 years old. The purpose of the present study was to determine the technical and interpretive changes in mammography following bariatric surgery. Accredited Academic Hospital. Two breast-imaging radiologists reviewed screening mammograms performed on 10 morbidly obese women undergoing bariatric surgery both pre- and postoperatively. American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR BI-RADS) density, imaging quality measurements, compression force, breast thickness, pectoral nipple line (PNL) length, and x-ray beam kilovoltage (kVp) and miliamperes per second (mAs) were recorded. The average patient age was 56 years old, with mean age at menarche of 13 years old; 70% of patients were postmenopausal (average age 49 years at menopause) and 50% had a family history of breast cancer. There was a significant reduction in both BMI (-13.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, P<.01) and waist circumference (-32.0 cm, P<.01) following bariatric surgery. There was a significant reduction in breast thickness (-23.8 mm), reduction in PNL length (-1.9 cm), reduction in kVp (-1.2), and reduction in mAs (-16.7) even though there was no compression force change in pre- and postoperative mammograms detected. All breast densities were fatty or scattered though there were more scattered and fewer fatty images after surgery (P = .002). Morbidly obese women can undergo quality mammograms before and after bariatric surgery; however, weight loss after bariatric surgery leads to only slightly denser mammograms. Furthermore, weight loss reduces mammographic radiation doses.

[PMID: 27783370] Obesity and breast density are both associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and are potentially modifiable. Weight loss surgery (WLS) causes a significant reduction in the amount of body fat and a decrease in breast cancer risk. The effect of WLS on breast density and its components has not been documented. Here, we analyze the impact of WLS on volumetric breast density (VBD) and on each of its components (fibroglandular volume and breast volume) by using three-dimensional methods. Fibroglandular volume, breast volume, and their ratio, the VBD, were calculated from mammograms before and after WLS by using Volpara™ automated software. For the 80 women included, average body mass index decreased from 46.0 ± 7.22 to 33.7 ± 7.06 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Mammograms were performed on average 11.6 ± 9.4 months before and 10.1 ± 7 months after WLS. There was a significant reduction in average breast volume (39.4 % decrease) and average fibroglandular volume (15.5 % decrease), and thus, the average VBD increased from 5.15 to 7.87 % (p < 1 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) after WLS. When stratified by menopausal status and diabetic status, VBD increased significantly in all groups but only perimenopausal and postmenopausal women and non-diabetics experienced a significant reduction in fibroglandular volume. Breast volume and fibroglandular volume decreased, and VBD increased following WLS, with the most significant change observed in postmenopausal women and non-diabetics. Further studies are warranted to determine how physical and biological alterations in breast density components after WLS may impact breast cancer risk.

[PMID: 24953110] While some genetic factors may explain the development of cancer, its main causes are related to environmental exposure to carcinogenic agents as well as to the effect of determined lifestyles and habits. Several epidemiological studies have shown a consistent relation between obesity and cancer. In non smokers, obesity is the most relevant risk factor in the development of malignant tumors. There is a clear association between obesity and endometrial cancer, breast cancer in postmenopausal women, pancreatic, esophageal and colon cancer. Sexual steroids, insulin like growth factor axis and adipokines are the three main models to explain the biological basis for the obesity-cancer relationship. However, these models do not explain all the biological mechanisms that link obesity to cancer. There are other factors in play such as chronic inflammation, hypoxia and oxidative stress. Obesity may hamper the screening, diagnosis and treatment of some tumors, increasing mortality rates. Obesity prevention and management, therefore, may be the most important modifiable factor in reducing both incidence and mortality in cancer. New studies are required to quantify the effect of intentional weight reduction on the incidence and relapse of cancer. Considering the efficacy of bariatric surgery for weight reduction, it is an attractive model to study this link.

[PMID: 41187383] High breast density impairs mammographic cancer detection. We investigated if contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) performance is less affected by density compared to conventional mammography, addressing this critical gap. This study retrospectively included 326 adult female patients. The study protocol was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform. Each image was annotated and evaluated by a minimum of two expert radiologists, while a team of radiologists produced detailed medical reports and manual segmentation annotations for abnormal findings. The reference standards for lesion classification included follow-up assessments and pathological evaluations. The overall malignant breast lesion diagnosis for CESM yielded a sensitivity of 95.4 % (95 % CI = 92.4 %-97.5 %) and a specificity of 94.0 % (95 % CI = 91.8 %-95.7 %). Conventional mammography demonstrated a sensitivity of 85.0 % (CI = 80.5 %-88.8 %) and a specificity of 93.5 % (95 % CI = 91.3 %-95.3 %), which were both slightly lower than those achieved with CESM. In level A density, both conventional mammography and CESM demonstrated complete sensitivity and specificity. At density levels B, C, and D, CESM demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional mammography. Our findings indicate that as breast density transitions from fatty (level A) to dense (level D), CESM retains its sensitivity, while conventional mammography shows a decrease. Integrating CESM into clinics could enhance reporting systems and facilitate clinical decision-making, especially for patients with dense breast tissue. CESM showed superior diagnostic performance in the detection of malignant lesions compared to conventional mammography. CESM retains its diagnostic performance at varying levels of breast densities in contrast to conventional mammography.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.",10

Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) may influence cancer behavior. This study aimed to investigate whether ASCs isolated from the omentum can act as progenitors of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and analyze their effects on the cancer stem cell (CSC) niche and the treatment resistance of GC cells. <b>Methods</b>: ASCs were isolated from the human omentum and their cellular characteristics were analyzed during co-culturing with GC cells. <b>Results:</b> ASCs express CAF markers and promote desmoplasia in cancer stroma in a mouse xenograft model. When co-cultured with GC cells, ASCs enhanced the sphere-forming efficiency of MKN45 and MKN74 cells. ASCs increased IL-6 secretion and enhanced the expression of Nanog and CD44v6 in GC cells; however, these changes were suppressed by the inhibition of IL-6. Xenograft mouse models co-inoculated with MKN45 cells and ASCs showed enhanced CD44v6 and Nanog expression and markedly reduced apoptosis induced by 5-FU treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study improves our understanding of ASCs' role in PM treatment resistance and has demonstrated the potential for new treatment strategies targeting ASCs.

[PMID: 38187532] Estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer is an aggressive breast cancer subtype with limited therapeutic options. Upregulated expression of both inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and cyclo-oxygenase (COX2) in breast tumors predicts poor clinical outcomes. Signaling molecules released by these enzymes activate oncogenic pathways, driving cancer stemness, metastasis, and immune suppression. The influence of tumor NOS2/COX2 expression on the landscape of immune markers using multiplex fluorescence imaging of 21 ER- breast tumors were stratified for survival. A powerful relationship between tumor NOS2/COX2 expression and distinct CD8+ T cell phenotypes was observed at 5 years post-diagnosis. These results were confirmed in a validation cohort using gene expression data showing that ratios of NOS2 to CD8 and COX2 to CD8 are strongly associated with poor outcomes in high NOS2/COX2-expressing tumors. Importantly, multiplex imaging identified distinct CD8+ T cell phenotypes relative to tumor NOS2/COX2 expression in Deceased vs Alive patient tumors at 5-year survival. CD8+NOS2-COX2- phenotypes defined fully inflamed tumors with significantly elevated CD8+ T cell infiltration in Alive tumors expressing low NOS2/COX2. In contrast, two distinct phenotypes including inflamed CD8+NOS2+COX2+ regions with stroma-restricted CD8+ T cells and CD8-NOS2-COX2+ immune desert regions with abated CD8+ T cell penetration, were significantly elevated in Deceased tumors with high NOS2/COX2 expression. These results were supported by applying an unsupervised nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, UMAP, correlating specific spatial CD8/NOS2/COX2 expression patterns with patient survival. Moreover, spatial analysis of the CD44v6 and EpCAM cancer stem cell (CSC) markers within the CD8/NOS2/COX2 expression landscape revealed positive correlations between EpCAM and inflamed stroma-restricted CD8+NOS2+COX2+ phenotypes at the tumor/stroma interface in deceased patients. Also, positive correlations between CD44v6 and COX2 were identified in immune desert regions in deceased patients. Furthermore, migrating tumor cells were shown to occur only in the CD8-NOS2+COX2+ regions, identifying a metastatic hot spot. Taken together, this study shows the strength of spatial localization analyses of the CD8/NOS2/COX2 landscape, how it shapes the tumor immune microenvironment and the selection of aggressive tumor phenotypes in distinct regions that lead to poor clinical outcomes. This technique could be beneficial for describing tumor niches with increased aggressiveness that may respond to clinically available NOS2/COX2 inhibitors or immune-modulatory agents.

[PMID: 37482243] Brain metastases (BMs) from colorectal cancer (CRC) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with chemoresistance and short overall survival. Migrating cancer stem cells with the ability to initiate BM have been described in breast and lung cancers. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of cancer stem cells in BM from CRC. Four brain metastasis stem cell lines from patients with colorectal cancer (BM-SC-CRC1 to BM-SC-CRC4) were obtained by mechanical dissociation of patient's tumors and selection of cancer stem cells by appropriate culture conditions. BM-SC-CRCs were characterized in vitro by clonogenic and limiting-dilution assays, as well as immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. In ovo, a chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model and in vivo, xenograft experiments using BALB/c-nude mice were realized. Finally, a whole exome and RNA sequencing analyses were performed. BM-SC-CRC formed metaspheres and contained tumor-initiating cells with self-renewal properties. They expressed stem cell surface markers (CD44v6, CD44, and EpCAM) in serum-free medium and CRC markers (CK19, CK20 and CDX-2) in fetal bovine serum-enriched medium. The CAM model demonstrated their invasive and migratory capabilities. Moreover, mice intracranial xenotransplantation of BM-SC-CRCs adequately recapitulated the original patient BM phenotype. Finally, transcriptomic and genomic approaches showed a significant enrichment of invasiveness and specific stemness signatures and highlighted KMT2C as a potential candidate gene to potentially identify high-risk CRC patients. This original study represents the first step in CRC BM initiation and progression comprehension, and further investigation could open the way to new therapeutics avenues to improve patient prognosis.

[PMID: 33639931] Gastric cancer (GC) is considered one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, which is accompanied by a poor prognosis. Although reports regarding the importance of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in gastric cancer progression have rapidly developed over the last few decades, their clinicopathological and prognostic values in gastric cancer still remain inconclusive. Therefore, the current meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively re-evaluate the association of CSC markers expression, overall and individually, with GC patients' clinical and survival outcomes. Literature databases including PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Embase were searched to identify the eligible articles. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were recorded or calculated to determine the relationships between CSC markers expression positivity and overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS)/relapse-free survival (RFS), disease-specific survival (DSS)/ cancer-specific survival (CSS), and clinicopathological features. We initially retrieved 4,425 articles, of which a total of 66 articles with 89 studies were considered as eligible for this meta-analysis, comprising of 11,274 GC patients. Overall data analyses indicated that the overexpression of CSC markers is associated with TNM stage (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.84-2.61, P = 0.013), lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.54-2.02, P < 0.001), worse OS (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.54-1.77, P < 0.001), poor CSS/DSS (HR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.33-2.15, P < 0.001), and unfavorable DFS/RFS (HR = 2.35, 95% CI 1.90-2.89, P < 0.001) in GC patients. However, CSC markers expression was found to be slightly linked to tumor differentiation (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.55, P = 0.035). Sub-analysis demonstrated a significant positive relationship between most of the individual markers, specially Gli-1, Oct-4, CD44, CD44V6, and CD133, and clinical outcomes as well as the reduced survival, whereas overexpression of Lgr-5, Nanog, and sonic hedgehog (Shh) was not found to be related to the majority of clinical outcomes in GC patients. The expression of CSC markers is mostly associated with worse outcomes in patients with GC, both overall and individual. The detection of a combined panel of CSC markers might be appropriate as a prognostic stratification marker to predict tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in patients with GC, which probably results in identifying novel potential targets for therapeutic approaches.

[PMID: 32105676] Remodeling of basement membrane proteins contributes to tumor progression towards the metastatic stage. One of these proteins, laminin 521 (LN521), sustains embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell self-renewal, but its putative role in cancer is poorly described. In the present study we found that LN521 promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) cell self-renewal and invasion. siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenously-produced laminin alpha 5, as well as treatment with neutralizing antibodies against integrin α3β1 and α6β1, were able to reverse the effect of LN521 on self-renewal. Exposure of CRC cells to LN521 enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation, and incubation with STAT3 inhibitors Napabucasin and Stattic was sufficient to block the LN521-driven self-renewal increase. Robust expression of laminin alpha 5 was detected in 7/10 liver metastases tissue sections collected from CRC patients as well as in mouse liver metastasis xenografts, in most cases within areas expressing metastasis cancer stem cell markers such as c-KIT and CD44v6. Finally, retrospective analysis of multiple CRC datasets highlighted the significant association between high LN521 mRNA expression and poor clinical outcome in colorectal cancer patients. Collectively our results indicate that high Laminin 521 expression is a frequent feature of metastatic dissemination in CRC and that it promotes cell invasion and self-renewal, the latter through engagement of integrin isoforms and activation of STAT3 signaling.

[PMID: 35117466] CD44 is a marker for colorectal cancer (CRC) stem cells (CCSCs), but its prognostic value remains controversial. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the expression profile of CD44 variants in CRC. The proto-oncogene mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (c-Kit) was previously found to play an important role in supporting CRC cells; however, the associations between c-Kit and CD44 (and its splice variants) remain largely unknown. A total of 148 patients with CRC were enrolled in the present study, and the levels of CD44, CD44 splice variant (v)3, CD44v6 and c-Kit were examined by immunohistochemical staining. Associations between these markers and clinicopathological parameters, as well as the extent to which these markers predict progression free-survival (PFS), were analyzed. A total of 29 (19.6%), 60 (40.5%) and 66 (44.6%) patients were CD44-, CD44v3- and CD44v6-positive, respectively. No clear c-Kit-positivity was detected in any of the patients. Analyses of clinicopathological features indicated that positive expression of CD44v3 was significantly associated with cell differentiation (P=0.03), and N (P=0.04), M (P<0.01) and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages (P<0.01). Univariate analysis demonstrated that T, N, M and TNM stages (all P<0.01), and CD44 (P<0.01), CD44v3 (P=0.03) and CD44v6 (P=0.02) levels were significantly associated with PFS. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that patients without CD44 expression (P<0.01) but with CD44v3 (P=0.04) and CD44v6 (P=0.02) expression exhibited significantly shortened PFS. CD44, CD44v3 and CD44v6 were determined to be heterogeneously expressed in CRC, and may aid in the prognostic prediction of patients with this disease.

[PMID: 31947887] CD44 is widely expressed in most vertebrate cells, whereas the expression of CD44v6 is restricted to only a few tissues and has been considered to be associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Thus, CD44v6 has been recognized as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for various cancers for more than a decade. However, despite many experimental studies, the structural dynamics and differences between CD44s and CD44v6, particularly in their stem region, still remain elusive. Here, a computational study was conducted to address these problems. We found that the stem of CD44s adopted predominantly two conformations, one featuring antiparallel β-sheets and the other featuring parallel β-sheets, whereas the stem of CD44v6 adopted mainly one conformation with relatively highly suppressed β-sheet contents. Moreover, Phe215 was found to be essential in the β-sheets of both CD44s and CD44v6. We finally found intramolecular Phe215-Trp224 hydrogen-bonding interactions and hydrophobic interactions with Phe215 that cooperatively drove conformational differences upon the addition of the v6 region to CD44. Our study elucidated the structural differences between the stem regions of CD44s and CD44v6 and thus can offer useful structural information for drug design to specifically target CD44v6 in promising clinical applications.

[PMID: 31114754] <b>Background:</b> CD44 is widely used as a putative cancer stem cells (CSCs) marker for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the prognostic role of CD44 in CRC remains controversial. <b>Methods:</b> We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of various CD44 isoforms and overall survival (OS) and clinicopathological features of CRC patients. <b>Results:</b> A total of 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Total CD44 isoforms overexpression was significantly correlated with worse OS of patients with CRC (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.08-1.61, <i>P</i> = 0.007). In a stratified analysis, a higher level of either CD44v6 or CD44v2 had an unfavorable impact on OS (HR<sub>CD44v6</sub> = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.10-2.14, <i>P</i> = 0.010; HR<sub>CD44v2</sub> = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.49-5.77, <i>P</i> = 0.002).

[PMID: 30451890] Colon cancer stem cells have been attributed to poor prognosis, therapeutic resistance and aggressive nature of the malignancy. Recent reports associated CD44v6 expression with relapse, metastasis and reduced 5-year survival of colon cancer patients, thereby making it a potential therapeutic target. Thus, in this study, comprehensive prediction and screening of CD44v6 against 1674 lead compounds was conducted. Silibinin was identified as a potential compound targeting CD44v6. Inorder to substantiate these findings, the cytotoxic effect of 5FU, Silibinin and 5FU+ Silibinin was assessed on human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 derived CD44+ subpopulation. 5FU+ Silibinin inhibited cell proliferation of CD44+ subpopulation at lower concentration than Silibinin standalone. Further, corresponding to CD44v6 knockdown cells, 5FU+ Silibinin treatment significantly decreased CD44v6, Nanog, CTNNB1 and CDKN2A expression whereas increased E-cadherin expression in HCT116 derived CD44+ cells. Moreover, synergistic effect of these drugs suppressed sphere formation, inhibited cell migration, triggered PARP cleavage and perturbation in mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby activating intrinsic apoptotic pathways and induced autophagic cell death. Importantly, 5FU+ Silibinin could inhibit PI3K/MAPK dual activation and arrest the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Thus, our study suggests that inhibition of CD44v6 attenuates stemness of colon cancer stem cells and holds a prospect of potent therapeutic target.

[PMID: 30409306] The cell-surface glycoprotein CD44 is an important oral cancer stem cell (OCSC) marker and plays significant role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) aggressiveness, however, the regulation of CD44 is incompletely understood. In the present study, 145 fresh human OSCC tissue specimens, including 18 adjacent normal, 42 noninvasive (N0), 53 invasive tumor samples (N<sub>1-3</sub>) and 32 chemo-radiation resistant samples (RCRT), were included. The expression of CD44 standard (CD44s) and variants (CD44v4, CD44v6); the activation of pERK1/2, GSK3β, NICD (Notch) pathways; the cell viability; and the MMP-9/-2 activity were assessed using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, MTT assay and gelatin zymography. OSCC cell lines, including parental (SCC9/SCC4) and Cisplatin-resistant (CisR-SCC9/-SCC4) cells, were used. Knock down of CD44v4/CD44v6 (by siRNA) or inactivation of MAPK/PI3K pathways using specific PD98059/LY294002 was achieved for in vitro analysis of chemoresistance and invasion/migration. Elevated CD44 variants were associated with overall OSCC progression, chemoresistance and invasion. Positive correlations were observed, mainly between the expression of CD44v4 and the activation of ERK1/2 causing chemoresistance, whereas CD44v6 expression and inactivation of GSK3β caused invasiveness of OSCC. Cisplatin resistant, CisR-SCC9/SCC4 cell lines showed OCSC properties. Inhibition of MEK/ERK1/2 by SMI or knock down (KD) of CD44v4 by siRNA reversed cisplatin-resistance, whereas blocking the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway by SMI or KD of CD44v6 isoforms by respective siRNA diminished invasion/metastasis potential. Collectively, our results demonstrated that CD44v4 expression is more linked with ERK1/2 activation and promote cisplatin resistance, whereas CD44v6 expression is associated primarily with PI3K/Akt/GSK3β activation and driving tumor invasion/migration.",10

Among UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms, one involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling via SERCA2b in adipose tissue; however, the underlying molecular basis remains elusive. Here, we report that an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored peptide, C4orf3 (also known as another regulin [ALN]), uncouples SERCA2b Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport from its ATP hydrolysis, rendering the SERCA2b-C4orf3 complex exothermic. Loss of C4orf3/ALN improved the energetic efficiency of SERCA2b-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport without affecting SERCA2 expression, thereby reducing adipose tissue thermogenesis and increasing the adiposity of mice. Notably, genetic depletion of C4orf3 resulted in compensatory activation of UCP1-dependent thermogenesis following cold challenge. We demonstrated that genetic loss of both C4orf3 and Ucp1 additively impaired cold tolerance in vivo. Together, this study identifies C4orf3 as the molecular resistor to SERCA2b-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> import that plays a key role in UCP1-independent thermogenesis and energy balance.

[PMID: 38928011] Adipose tissue is conventionally recognized as a metabolic organ responsible for storing energy. However, a proportion of adipose tissue also functions as a thermogenic organ, contributing to the inhibition of weight gain and prevention of metabolic diseases. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the study of thermogenic fats, particularly brown adipose tissue (BAT). Despite this progress, the mechanism underlying thermogenesis in beige adipose tissue remains highly controversial. It is widely acknowledged that beige adipose tissue has three additional thermogenic mechanisms in addition to the conventional UCP1-dependent thermogenesis: Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling thermogenesis, creatine substrate cycling thermogenesis, and triacylglycerol/fatty acid cycling thermogenesis. This paper delves into these three mechanisms and reviews the latest advancements in the molecular regulation of thermogenesis from the molecular genetic perspective. The objective of this review is to provide readers with a foundation of knowledge regarding the beige fats and a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of this process, which may lead to the development of new strategies for maintaining human health.

[PMID: 32849287] Mammals have two types of thermogenic adipocytes: brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes. Thermogenic adipocytes express high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) to dissipates energy in the form of heat by uncoupling the mitochondrial proton gradient from mitochondrial respiration. There is much evidence that UCP1 is the center of BAT thermogenesis and systemic energy homeostasis. Recently, UCP1 independent thermogenic pathway identified in thermogenic adipocytes. Importantly, the thermogenic pathways are different in brown and beige adipocytes. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 2b calcium cycling mechanism is selective to beige adipocytes. It remains unknown how the multiple thermogenic mechanisms are coordinately regulated. The discovery of UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms potential offer new opportunities for improving obesity and type 2 diabetes particularly in groups such as elderly and obese populations who do not possess UCP1 positive adipocytes.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187380] Mutations of the Ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene are generally associated with syndromic tooth agenesis, yet their influence on non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) has not been thoroughly elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of NSTA and to identify pathogenic EDA mutations in two Chinese families using whole-exome sequencing, and explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Two unrelated individuals with NSTA and their families were enrolled in this study, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Whole-exome sequencing was performed, followed by variants detection and filtering to identify pathogenic genes and mutations. The identified genetic mutations were further validated by Sanger sequencing and confirmed to be absent in 300 unrelated healthy individuals. Conservation analysis, three-dimensional (3D) modeling, and electrostatic potential calculations were conducted accordingly. We identified a novel mutation c.827 G>T (p.Arg276Leu) and a previously reported mutation c.1069 C>T (p.Arg357Trp) in the EDA gene, with the latter showing previously unreported phenotypic characteristics. Both mutations are located in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) domain of EDA, which is crucial for binding with ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR). Conservation analysis indicated that these mutations are evolutionarily conserved across various species. In silico predictions and 3D modeling analyses suggested that these mutations may be pathogenic, potentially due to alterations in the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic potential, thereby affecting EDA-EDAR interaction. Our findings broaden the mutation spectrum of EDA gene associated with NSTA by identifying a novel mutation and provide a basis for future genetic counseling.

Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187370] An improved route to the indolequinone pharmacophore is described based on the reaction of bromobenzoquinones with enamines. Through the implementation of small changes in the reaction conditions, the reaction conditions were much improved with quantities of copper salt, base, and acetonitrile solvent all reduced compared with the original method. The resulting indolequinone-3-carboxylates were subsequently converted into novel indolequinones as potential inhibitors of the quinone reductase enzyme NQO2. A number of potent, mechanism-based inhibitors were identified, increasing our understanding of structure-activity relationships for inhibition of this enzyme.

[PMID: 41187366] The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, primarily through mechanisms involving carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Aberrant FGFR1 signalling has been implicated in various cancers, including lung, breast, neck and urothelial carcinoma. Despite the recognized oncogenic potential of FGFR1, therapeutic strategies targeting its kinase domain remain inadequately explored. This underscores an urgent need for the development of novel FGFR1 inhibitors, particularly through de novo drug design approaches, to effectively counteract FGFR1-driven malignancies. This research aims to develop novel FGFR1 inhibitors through a multi-step approach involving fragment-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and density functional theory studies (DFT), with the goal of targeting FGFR1's kinase binding domain to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Initially, known FGFR inhibitor molecules were retrieved and subjected to fragment-based drug designing and virtual screening. Through thorough analysis, molecules containing the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold were identified as promising candidates. A pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based database containing 90,952 molecules was subsequently retrieved from PubChem and filtered using molecular docking-based virtual screening resulting 94 molecules having better binding affinity than derazantinib, reference drug. After pharmacokinetic profiling (ADME), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) studies, out of 94 molecules only 11 compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and superior MM-GBSA binding free energies were selected. Docking-based screening revealed that selected 11 compounds demonstrated better binding scores than the reference drug, derazantinib. Among them, HIT1, was selected for 150ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess its conformational stability. DFT calculations further confirmed its bio-feasibility by analyzing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Overall, the selected lead compounds exhibited enhanced binding affinity, superior conformational stability, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to derazantinib. Present findings suggest that the identified hit molecules hold strong potential for inhibiting FGFR1's kinase domain and disrupting FGFR-associated tumor angiogenesis.",10

[PMID: 41186886] Procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1) is important for extracellular matrix formation and is involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer; however, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mechanistic importance of PLOD1 as a regulator of GC. We examined the potential function and prognostic efficiency of PLOD1 in GC using a variety of bioinformatics methods. In vitro, we assessed the ability of PLOD1 to regulate GC by CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, and Elisa assay analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of PLOD1 on the immune escape of GC cells by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Elisa assay. Analysis of PLOD1 expression in gastric cancer and other cancers in public databases as well as survival showed that low expression of PLOD1 has better survival, while the AUC area under the ROC curve of this gene showed that this gene has better prognostic value. Meanwhile, the results of correlation analysis between PLOD1 and 60 immune checkpoints showed that the gene was positively correlated with immune checkpoint genes, and one of the genes with the largest correlation was CD276, and the pearson's correlation between PLOD1 and cancer immune cycle was also calculated, and the relationship between PLOD1 and the immune microenvironment was evaluated, and the enrichment of the immune infiltration analysis into a larger number of immune cells among which the importance of PLOD1 was determined. Differential gene analysis was then performed on the gastric cancer dataset, using the differential genes to perform WGCNA network co-expression analysis with the PLOD1 gene, and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed on these differential genes, enriching for cancer-related pathways and cell cycle signaling pathways. Two key genes were then obtained in the analysis with glycolysis, while drug sensitivity analysis was performed, yielding multiple potential drugs such as AZD7545, BRD-K03911514 and BRD-K14844214. Furthermore, in vitro experiments further demonstrated that PLOD1 increased the proliferation and migration ability of GC cells by promoting immune escape. The results of this study suggest that PLOD1 is an important regulator of GC progression and participates in the immune escape process of GC, which is expected to be a potential target for GC treatment.

[PMID: 41186719] Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase and core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is an important player in cancer progression through its powerful effects on chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. In addition to its classical role in regulating the cell cycle and tumor proliferation, numerous publications have identified the broad role of EZH2 in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), leading to immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. EZH2 has been shown to silence immune surveillance genes by binding to H3K27me3 histone, leading to epigenetic silencing in lymphomas and thereby reducing tumor immunogenicity, which facilitates immune escape. EZH2 also modulates the recruitment and activity of immunosuppressive cells by epigenetically modifying cytokine and chemokine networks. Importantly, EZH2 upregulates PD-L1 expression either directly or indirectly through its pro-oncogenic activation of STAT3 signaling, which induces T cell exhaustion and ultimately resistance to checkpoint inhibitors in cancers such as breast cancer and glioblastoma. Furthermore, EZH2 also influences the regulation of immune-related microRNAs, including the suppression of the miR-144/451a cluster, which encourages immunosuppressive macrophage polarization. Pharmacological EZH2 inhibition has been shown to be an arm of a synergistic therapy, combining immune checkpoint blockade therapies, which can reinstate antigen presentation and T cell infiltration, highlighting EZH2 as an essential epigenetic modulator of tumor-immune interactions. It remains a viable target for therapy to overcome immune resistance and improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes.

[PMID: 41186576] Circadian clocks orchestrate the daily rhythms of physiological functions. The underlying mechanisms of circadian clocks are highly conserved across species, driven by endogenous transcriptional-translational feedback loops. CLOCK, a central transcription factor in circadian regulation, requires coregulatory factors and histone modification dynamics to regulate downstream clock-controlled gene expression. In this study, we identify the Drosophila polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) as a previously unrecognized regulator of the circadian transcriptional machinery. We found that knocking down different subunits of Paf1C in pacemaker neurons lengthens the circadian locomotion period. Specifically, downregulation of rtf1, a core subunit of Paf1C, significantly dampens the amplitude of circadian rhythms and extends the locomotor period. This effect is primarily attributed to a reduction in the pacemaker protein PERIOD (PER), mediated through decreased per transcription. Indeed, the overexpression of per in pacemaker neurons rescues the circadian defects caused by rtf1 downregulation. Mechanistically, we identified that rtf1 enhances CLK-mediated per transcription activation. RTF1 physically interacts with CLK, thus promoting its occupancy on the promoters of per and other clock genes. Furthermore, the H3K4me3 methyltransferase SET1 forms complex with CLK and RTF1, facilitates their interaction, and thereby increases H3K4me3 levels at the per/tim promoter to promote their expression. Notably, we discovered that human RTF1 physically interacts with BMAL1/CLOCK and affects the circadian rhythms in U2OS cells, indicating a potentially conserved mechanism in mammals. Together, our results demonstrate that RTF1 regulates circadian rhythms by modulating CLK occupancy and H3K4me3 levels at pacemaker gene promoters.

[PMID: 41186411] We have previously reported that human adenovirus E1A interacts with ARGLU1, a small disordered cellular protein. The consequences of this interaction for virus replication were unclear. E1A is the first protein produced during adenovirus infection. Via protein-protein interactions, E1A modifies the cellular environment to create optimal conditions for viral replication. To better understand the molecular mechanisms driving viral infection, we further investigated the functional consequences of the interaction between ARGLU1 and E1A. ARGLU1 interacts with E1A directly as determined by a GST-pulldown assay with recombinant proteins. Importantly, ARGLU1 was found to act as a transcriptional repressor when it was localized to viral promoters. Repression was driven by enhanced promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II pausing. Significantly, ARGLU1-induced repression of viral promoters is likely an unintended consequence of ARGLU1 binding to E1A, as a mutant of E1A (<i>dl</i>1102), unable to bind to ARGLU1, did not show reduced viral gene expression. Furthermore, ARGLU1 was found to colocalize with E1A in infected cell nuclei. Finally, the binding of E1A to ARGLU1 appears to reduce DNA damage repair in bleomycin-treated and adenovirus-infected cells, suggesting that E1A binding to ARGLU1 is important for DNA damage response inhibition. Overall, this study underscores the complexity of virus-host interactions and reveals a novel role for ARGLU1 during adenoviral infection.IMPORTANCEThis study uncovers a novel antiviral role for ARGLU1, known for its involvement in splicing, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. Our study demonstrates that ARGLU1 functions as a viral restriction factor by reducing virus growth through the inhibition of viral gene expression and enhanced DNA damage response, leading to reduced viral growth. These findings not only highlight an important role for ARGLU1 in host antiviral mechanisms but also emphasize the utility of adenovirus as a tool to uncover critical cellular pathways.

[PMID: 41186356] The cornea operates under robust circadian control and is essential for ocular-surface homeostasis. Hypoxic stress-prevalent in many eye disorders and systemic conditions-can disturb these rhythms and compromise epithelial, neural, and immune balance. Here, we examine how environmental hypoxia (EH) and chemical hypoxia (CH) reshape corneal clock-gene expression and tissue integrity. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to normoxia (NC), EH (10% O2), or CH (CoCl2, 15 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) for 14 days. Corneas were collected at 3-hour intervals across a 24-hour cycle for bulk RNA sequencing. Rhythmic genes were identified by Jonckheere-Terpstra-Kendall CYCLE (JTK_CYCLE), and pathway enrichment was assessed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Phase Set Enrichment Analysis (PSEA). Immunofluorescence staining evaluated epithelial junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin), neural markers (βIII-tubulin), and immune cells (Ly6G⁺ neutrophils, γδ T cells). Hypoxia significantly increased rhythmic transcripts (by ∼43% in EH and ∼35% in CH), with over 65% of rhythmic genes showing phase shifts. CH specifically upregulated core circadian clock genes (Per1, Cry2, Nr1d2, Rora) and downregulated Per2, possibly via HIF-1α-mediated mechanisms. Both EH and CH impaired epithelial barrier integrity, reduced corneal nerve density, and altered immune cell infiltration, with peak disruption at Zeitgeber time 18 (ZT18). Additionally, CH uniquely induced barrier dysfunction and immune suppression at ZT3, indicating a model-specific vulnerability window. Hypoxia drives model-specific and circadian phase-dependent reprogramming of corneal transcriptomic rhythms, resulting in coordinated structural and immune dysfunction. Identifying ZT18 and ZT3 as critical phases highlights the potential for chronotherapeutic interventions in hypoxia-related ocular surface disorders.

[PMID: 41185962] Ageing is a complex biological process driven, in part, by inflammaging. Recent research identifies the ectodysplasin A2 receptor (EDA2R) as a key regulator of inflammaging and a novel biomarker of ageing, with its expression increasing with age across diverse tissues in humans and animal models. Elevated EDA2R gene expression is associated with accelerated ageing, cellular senescence, frailty, obesity, acne, radiation response and increased levels of inflammatory, renal, cardiac and vascular biomarkers. Similarly, elevated EDA2R protein levels, a critical component of the proteomic ageing clock, are associated with a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, dementia, Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, various cancers, osteoarthritis, digestive diseases, diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ear and eye diseases, renal impairment, systemic autoimmune diseases, anaemia, bacterial infections, myositis, frailty, accelerated biological ageing, shorter telomere length, decreased healthspan and longevity, higher all-cause mortality and overall poor health. Beyond serving as a biomarker, EDA2R actively drives ageing, as its overexpression induces inflammation and tissue damage, whereas its inhibition mitigates these effects. Mechanistically, EDA2R activates non-canonical and canonical NF-κB signalling, promoting pro-inflammatory and catabolic processes that accelerate ageing phenotypes. Genetic variants of EDA2R are linked to alopecia, facial ageing, lipid profiles and prostate cancer. This review explores the structure and function of the EDA2R gene and protein, its role in tissue-specific ageing, and its therapeutic potential for multiple diseases. Although specific EDA2R antagonists are not yet available, interventions like calorie restriction, physical activity and specific supplements show promise in lowering EDA2R levels.

[PMID: 41185464] Circadian rhythm is an essential biological process that synchronises physiological activities with environmental light/dark cycles. However, its regulatory mechanisms in tooth development remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in circadian rhythm regulation and daily mineralization during tooth development using immunofluorescence, circadian rhythm tracking, and genetic models. Spatiotemporal analysis of rat dental germs revealed that oscillatory expression patterns of p75NTR closely aligned with clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1, Per2), mineralization-related factors, and odontogenesis-related factors. p75NTR knockout mice (p75NTR<sup>ExIII-/-</sup>) exhibited reduced body weight, lower melatonin levels, delayed incisor eruption, decreased daily mineralization width, and downregulation of core clock genes. Mechanistically, p75NTR overexpression in immortalised stem cells from the dental apical papilla (iSCAPs) upregulated casein kinase 2 (CK2) expression, enhanced PER2 phosphorylation, and promoted nuclear p-PER2 accumulation, while CK2 inhibition partially reversed these effects. In vivo, CK2 inhibition via quinalizarin exacerbated incisor eruption defects in p75NTR<sup>ExIII-/-</sup> mice. These findings demonstrate that p75NTR regulates circadian-driven mineralization and tooth morphogenesis, probably via the CK2/PER2 pathway, providing critical insight into the interplay between the circadian rhythm and dental development.

[PMID: 41185393] Advanced dual-channel fluorescent probes for simultaneous biomarker detection are in critical demand nowadays in biomedical research. Herein, a blue-green emissive ratiometric probe CD@Tb has been engineered by coupling pyridinedicarboxylate-functionalized carbon dots (CD) with Tb<sup>3+</sup> ions. This probe exhibits ultrasensitive and selective detection of epinephrine (EP, LOD: 1.2 nM) and pyrophosphate (PPi, LOD: 0.25 μM) via distinct fluorescence responses: Epinephrine (EP) enhances the blue emission while suppressing the green emission by deactivating the excited state of terbium through energy transfer. In contrast, pyrophosphate (PPi) amplifies the green emission of terbium through bridging coordination by inducing carbon dot aggregation, which strengthens the antenna effect, while simultaneously diminishing the blue emission. The sensing efficiency of the probe was tested in real human blood serum samples to check its reliability. Moreover, after thorough testing of its biocompatibility, the CD@Tb probe was employed as an imaging tool for visualization of epinephrine in human neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y, and pyrophosphate in mouse fibroblast cells, NIH 3T3.

[PMID: 41184881] Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is characterized by poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The homologous recombination factor with OB-fold (HROB) is reportedly associated with DNA repair, playing an essential role in a variety of cancers. However, the functional impact, clinical relevance, and underlying mechanisms of HROB in LUAD remain elusive, prompting this study to comprehensively characterize its expression profile and pathogenetic contributions. We first systematically profiled HROB expression across pan-cancer contexts and multiple cell lines. To characterize its clinical relevance in LUAD, we employed receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression modeling. Potential molecular mechanisms underlying HROB function were interrogated enrichment analyses and immune correlation studies. Using RT-PCR, we quantified HROB expression in different LUAD cell lines, followed by functional characterization through Cell Counting Kit-8(CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), wound-healing, and Transwell assays. HROB exhibited significant overexpression in LUAD tissues compared to normal, with high diagnostic accuracy. Elevated HROB expression was strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Bioinformatics analysis revealed HROB's involvement in modulating immune cell infiltration, regulating cell cycle progression and DNA repair pathways. Besides, BUB1B, BUB1, NUF2, CCNB2, CCNB1, KIF11, KIF2C, TPX2, DLGAP5, and CDCA8 were identified as potential hub genes within HROB-associated signaling modules. Knocking down HROB expression inhibited LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. HROB is upregulated in LUAD and represents a promising prognostic biomarker, driving tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion.",10

As it lacks a specific antidote, treatment is mainly supportive, focusing on reducing oxidative damage and organ dysfunction. Despite aggressive intervention, the condition can rapidly progress to multiorgan failure. This report presents a fatal case of PQ poisoning, highlighting its clinical course and management challenges. A 45-year-old female ingested 10 mL of 20% PQ, presenting with vomiting, dizziness, and generalized body aches. At presentation, she was alert, with stable vital signs and no significant findings. Immediate treatment, including gastric lavage, activated charcoal, corticosteroids, antioxidants, and monitoring of renal and hepatic function, was initiated. On Day 2, her condition deteriorated with jaundice, respiratory distress, and PQ-induced tongue ulcers. Lab results showed worsening renal and hepatic dysfunction. She received cyclophosphamide, <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine, and heparin-free hemodialysis, but her condition continued to decline, leading to multiorgan failure. She succumbed to her condition on the fourth day. PQ toxicity causes oxidative stress, resulting in rapid progression to multiorgan failure. Early decontamination and supportive care are key, but no curative treatment exists. The rapid progression and limited effectiveness of current therapies make management difficult. PQ poisoning remains a critical medical emergency with a high-mortality rate. Timely recognition, aggressive supportive care, and further research into novel detoxification and therapeutic strategies are essential to improving survival outcomes. Additionally, public health measures, including stricter regulations and increased awareness regarding PQ's toxicity, are crucial in preventing future cases.

[PMID: 38059846] We report the observations of two patients, having voluntarily ingested lethal doses of paraquat with suicidal intent, with an unfavorable prognostic score. The treatment consisted of gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, n-acetylcysteine and cyclophosphamide + methylprednisolone + dexamethasone. The installation of acute renal failure motivated the initiation of daily conventional hemodialysis (HD) over 10 to 14 days, with a favorable evolution. The following complications were recorded: anemia, bacteremia and deep vein thrombosis. These observations raise three questions in the treatment of paraquat intoxication: the effectiveness of HD, the interest of its association with the above therapies in the prevention of pulmonary fibrosis, and the need for infectious prevention and thromboembolism. Furthermore, the absence of a paraquatemia assay cannot constitute a limitation for management, and hemoperfusion on an inaccessible charcoal column can be replaced by an HD usually available.

[PMID: 30809298] Accidental or suicidal ingestion of the world's most widely used herbicide, paraquat (PQ), may result in rapid multi-organ failure with a 60% fatality rate due to the absence of an effective detoxification solution. Effective, specific antidotes to PQ poisoning have been highly desired. <b>Methods:</b> The binding constant of PQ and a synthetic receptor, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), was first determined in various pH environments. The antidotal effects of CB[7] on PQ toxicity were firstly evaluated with <i>in-vitro</i> cell lines. With <i>in-vivo</i> mice models, the pharmacokinetics and the biodistribution of PQ in major organs were determined to evaluate the influence of CB[7] on the oral bioavailability of PQ. Major organs' injuries and overall survival rates of the mice were systemically examined to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CB[7] on PQ poisoning. <b>Results:</b> We demonstrate that CB[7] may complex PQ strongly under various conditions and significantly reduce its toxicity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Oral administration of PQ in the presence of CB[7] in a mouse model significantly decreased PQ levels in the plasma and major organs and alleviated major organs' injuries, when compared to those of mice administered with PQ alone. Further studies indicated that oral administration of CB[7] within 2 h post PQ ingestion significantly increased the survival rates and extended the survival time of the mice, in contrast to the ineffective treatment by activated charcoal, which is commonly recommended for PQ decontamination. <b>Conclusion:</b> CB[7] may be used as a specific oral antidote for PQ poisoning by strongly binding with PQ and inhibiting its absorption in the gastrointestinal tracts.

[PMID: 30045322] Paraquat, an agent highly toxic to humans and animals, is a widely used herbicide and also commonly used for suicide attempts in Taiwan. The most common route of intoxication is oral ingestion, and parenteral poisoning is respectively rare. A 39-year-old illicit abuser of heroin and amphetamine injected 0.5 mL of 24% paraquat directly into his right cephalic vein due to hallucination. The patient was brought to our emergency department for management 4 hours after injection. He was fully conscious and had normal vital signs. Systemic review showed mild dyspnea, abdominal pain and right wrist pain over the injection site. The only abnormal physical finding was erythema over the injection site and epigastric tenderness. Laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver and renal function, and electrolytes initially yielded normal results. Urinalysis showed normal findings except a positive urine paraquat test (4+). The initial plasma paraquat concentration was 0.51 μg/mL. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent one session of charcoal hemoperfusion therapy. Acute kidney injury developed on the fourth day after intoxication, with the level of serum creatinine rising rapidly from 0.96 to 4.57 mg/dL and the daily urine output decreased noticeably from > 2000 to 900 mL. The serum creatinine level improved gradually with adequate fluid supplementation. The patient was discharged 13 days later in a stable condition. Intravenous paraquat intoxication is rare. Patients who suffer from intravenous intoxication may not directly suffer from mucosal irritation, but the clinical onset of systemic effects is more immediate and lethal. The prognosis of paraquat poisoning is determined by the time of poisoning and the plasma paraquat concentration before treatment. Proudfoot's curve provides a simple method of predicting the survival rate. The most effective mode of management is extracorporeal therapy, and immunosuppressive or antioxidant therapies have shown insufficient evidence of benefit.

[PMID: 29456670] The present study retrospectively analyzed 19 patients diagnosed with paraquat (PQ) poisoning with the aim to investigate the effect of activated charcoal hemoperfusion on renal function and PQ elimination. The results indicated that 7 patients died and 12 survived. Non-oliguric renal failure occurred in all of the 7 patients who died. Among the 12 surviving patients, 10 had normal renal function and 2 developed non-oliguric renal failure. There was a linear correlation between plasma and urine paraquat concentration prior to and during activated charcoal hemoperfusion. The equation parameters together with the correlation coefficient on admission were as follows: Y=0.5820+1.7348X (R<sup>2</sup>=0.678; F=35.768; P<0.0001). The equation parameters together with the correlation coefficient were as follows during activated charcoal hemoperfusion: Y=0.6827+1.2649X (R<sup>2</sup>=0.626; F=50.308; P<0.0001). Therefore, it was concluded that in patients with normal renal function, the elimination kinetics of PQ by the kidneys were only associated with the plasma PQ concentration. Activated charcoal hemoperfusion had little effect on avoiding acute kidney injury in patients with severe PQ poisoning.

[PMID: 28627339] To study the adsorption effect of activated charcoal suspension on paraquat (PQ) in gastrointestinal tract of beagles exposed to PQ. Twenty healthy male beagles were randomly divided into experimental group and control group, with 6 beagles in each group. 20% PQ solution (a dose of 30 mg/kg) was prescribed through stomach for beagles in both groups. After exposure to PQ for 30 minutes, the beagles in experimental group were given activated charcoal suspension (1.0 g/kg of type I activated charcoal powder mixed with 100 mL of normal saline) by gavage, while the control group was only given equal volume of normal saline. After exposure to PQ for 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours, blood was collected from hepatic portal veins and peripheral veins to detect the PQ concentration change in the plasma. The toxicokinetics software DAS 2.1.1 was applied to analyze PQ concentration and compare the change in toxicokinetics parameters between the both groups. The change in vital signs including heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was dynamically monitored 10 minutes before exposure, 4 hours and each day from the 1st to the 7th day after exposure. After exposure to PQ, the poison concentration in the plasma of hepatic portal veins and peripheral veins in the control group rose quickly and reached peak 4 hours later. It fell quickly at first, and fell slowly 8 hours later. But in the experimental group, the increase rate to the peak was significantly slow. Besides, PQ peak fell more obviously than that in the control group and it was about 50% of the control group (μg/L: 123.50±11.67 vs. 255.18±12.29 in blood from hepatic portal veins, 122.35±11.72 vs. 250.86±11.15 in blood from peripheral veins). After 8 hours it fell much more quickly than that of the control group. After exposure to PQ for 48 hours, PQ concentration in the plasma was still lower than that of the control group (μg/L: 0.53±0.18 vs. 15.98±5.58 in blood from hepatic portal veins, 0.31±0.01 vs. 15.03±4.82 in blood from peripheral veins, both P < 0.01). With the toxicokinetics analysis, compared with the control group, the maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) of PQ in the plasma of hepatic portal veins and peripheral veins in the experimental group were significantly decreased [Cmax (μg/L): 125.07±9.49 vs. 255.18±12.29 in blood from hepatic portal veins, 123.38±9.52 vs. 250.86±11.15 in blood from peripheral veins; AUC (mg×L<sup>-1</sup>×h<sup>-1</sup>): 1.6±0.2 vs. 3.3±0.4 in blood from hepatic portal veins, 1.5±0.2 vs. 3.2±0.3 in blood from peripheral veins], time to the peak (Tmax) of PQ was slowed (hours: 5.3±1.9 vs. 4.0±0.0 in blood from hepatic portal veins, 4.7±1.5 vs. 4.0±0.0 in blood from peripheral veins), and PQ plasma half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) and mean retention time (MRT) were significantly shortened [t<sub>1/2</sub> (hours): 3.8±1.2 vs. 15.4±3.7 in blood from hepatic portal veins, 3.5±1.0 vs. 15.5±2.7 in blood from peripheral veins; MRT (hours): 8.0±1.5 vs. 13.4±1.2 in blood from hepatic portal veins, 7.6±1.3 vs. 13.3±1.2 in blood from peripheral veins; all P < 0.01]. After exposure to PQ, HR and RR in both the experimental group and the control group increased and reached to the peak about the 4th day and then the increase rate began to slow down gradually; SpO<sub>2</sub> slowed down gradually and reached to the valley about the 4th day and then it began to recover, but the change range of vital signs in the experimental group was smaller than that of the control group, and the parameters were significantly better than those of control group [4-day HR (bpm): 134.50±3.04 vs. 142.00±6.43, 4-day RR (times/min): 31.00±0.58 vs. 34.33±0.94, 4-day SpO<sub>2</sub>: 0.900±0.006 vs. 0.873±0.005, all P < 0.05]. Activated charcoal administrated at 30 minutes after PQ poisoning can slow down the increase rate of PQ concentration in the plasma, decrease the peak concentration and has less influence on vital signs in beagles.

[PMID: 25253933] Herbicide poisoning is most common method of suicide in India and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Among different herbicidal poisonings the most predominantly found poisonings are paraquat and glyphosate. These compounds are highly toxic and their poisonings require proper management techniques. High fatality is seen in these cases which are mainly due to its inherent toxicity and lack of effective treatment. Common symptoms of these poisonings includes gastrointestinal corrosive effects with mouth and throat, epigastric pain and dysphagia, acid-base imbalance, pulmonary edema, shock and arrhythmia. Long term health effects include pulmonary fibrosis, renal failure, hepatic failure, heart failure, multi-organ failure or death. No proven antidote exists for these poisonings. So the treatment is mainly supportive. Initially gastric lavage or whole-gut irrigation using adsorbents such as Fuller's earth, bentonite or activated charcoal is recommended. In case of renal failure hemodialysis or hemoperfusion may be considered. However novel approaches like treatment with N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C, vitamin E, cyclophosphamide may also be helpful.

[PMID: 24052974] The authors described three groups of patients after acute poisonings. In the first group were 60 patients after carbon tetrachioride poisoning, the second group consisted of 81 patients after mushroom poisoning and 20 patients after ethylene glycol poisoning were in the third group. Besides two patients with rare poisonings after potassium dichromate and after paraquat poisoning were analysed. All groups of patients with the kidney damage were presented from the diagnostic, differential diagnostic, conservative, ntra- and extracorporeal elimination treatment point of view. In the group of patients suffering from acute carbon tetrachloride poisoning and with acute renal failure following therapy was used: conservative treatment, exchange blood transfusion--in 4 patients in hepatic coma, renal replacement therapy (peritoneal dialysis, haemodialysis, plasmapheresis). From the total number of 60 patients 58 survived and 2 patients died in liver coma. Survival of patients after mushroom poisoning depended on amount of oral use of mushroom (Amanita phalloides), on early admission in dialysis centre and on early beginning of renal replacement therapy within 24 hr after acute poisoning. Twenty four patients from 81 patients of this group died. Main clinical signs of ethylene glycol poisoning were various neurological symptoms (cramps, hemiparesis, coma), severe metabolic acidosis (pH = 7.06 +/- 0.14), leucocytosis (26.4 +/- 5.5x 10(9)/L) and the signs of acute toxic hepatitis and of acute renal failure. Calcium oxalic crystals in urine were present in 17 patients and leucocytosis was observed in every patient. In the first 4 patients we administered intravenously ethylalcohol as an antidotum and later in other patients we used ethylalcohol in dialysis solution. The concentration of ethylalcohol in dialysis solution was 100 mg%. Severe metabolic acidosis improved in 17 patients using bicarbonate haemodialysis and 3 patients died before the possibility to use bicarbonate haemodialysis. Eighty-four hours after acute potassium dichromate poisoning and 24 hours after exchange blood transfusion during haemodialysis a 41-year old man died in haemorhagic shock, which developed after the extensive chemical burns of mucous membrane of gastrointestinal tract caused by this poison. Our patient after paraquat poisoning was treated by repeated charcoal haemoperfusion and haemodialysis. Despite of that therapy the patient died in severe respiratory insufficiency.

[PMID: 23892316] A general synthetic method for functionalization of mesoporous silica with amino acid has been developed. The carboxylic acid functionalized SBA-15 was conjugated with l-phenylalanine (Phe) and l-tryptophan (Trp) to obtain nontoxic amino acid-conjugated functionalized mesoporous silica materials. The materials were used as adsorbents for the removal of the herbicide Paraquat (PQ) and its analog, ethyl viologen dibromide (EVB) from aqueous solutions. In comparison to the commercially available activated carbon adsorbents, the silica-based adsorbents prepared in this study exhibited relatively higher PQ removal efficiency in aqueous solutions at room temperature and pH 7.0. The silica-based adsorbents, pendant with amino acid moieties exhibited greater adsorption capacities toward PQ and EVB than the analogs but without the amino acid moiety, suggesting that there is a benefit for the enhanced π-π interaction between the aromatic groups of the conjugated amino acid moieties and the adsorbate. This bioconjugated method developed here provides a promising new tool to synthesize new materials for detoxification of herbicides in clinical trials.

[PMID: 23528512] This observational study examined the outcome of Taiwanese pediatric patients with paraquat poisoning and compared these data with the published data on paraquat poisonings from other international poisoning centers. We performed a retrospective study on children with acute paraquat poisoning that were admitted to the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital during a period of 10 years (2000-2010). Of the 193 paraquat poisoning patients, only 6 were children. The mean age was 8.85 ± 5.55 (1-15.6) years. Younger patients had accidentally swallowed paraquat, whereas older patients had intentionally ingested paraquat. Most patients were referred within a relatively short period (0.5-2.0 hours). Paraquat poisoning was associated with high morbidity and often resulted in severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure. The complications included shock (50.0%), hypoxemia (33.3%), respiratory failure (33.3%), nausea/vomiting (16.7%), abdominal pain (33.3%), hepatitis (66.7%), gastrointestinal tract bleeding (33.3%), acute renal failure (33.3%), and seizures (16.7%). Patients were treated aggressively with a standard detoxification protocol consisting of gastric lavage, active charcoal, charcoal hemoperfusion, and cyclophosphamide and steroid pulse therapies. Secondary bacterial infections were common after hospitalization and included sepsis (33.3%), pneumonia (33.3%), and urinary tract infection (50.0%). In the end, 2 patients (33.3%) died from multiple-organ failure, despite intensive resuscitation. Our data (mortality rate, 33.3%) are comparable to the data of other published reports from other international poison centers. Evidently, a prompt diagnosis of paraquat poisoning and an immediate institution of a detoxification protocol is a prerequisite for a favorable outcome.",10
Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment decreases brown adipose tissue activity.,Chenodeoxycholic acid AND Brown adipose tissue activity AND Reduction AND Treatment effects,"37122689,27634226,27488269,41187384,41187381,41187376,41187375,41187372,41187371,41187346","[PMID: 37122689] Although fat loss is observed in patients with cholestasis, how chronically elevated bile acids (BAs) impact white and brown fat depots remains obscure. To determine the direct effect of pathological levels of BAs on lipid accumulation and mitochondrial function, primary white and brown adipocyte cultures along with fat depots from two separate mouse models of cholestatic liver diseases, namely (i) genetic deletion of farnesoid X receptor (<i>Fxr</i>); small heterodimer (<i>Shp</i>) double knockout (DKO) and (ii) injury by 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), were used. As expected, cholestatic mice accumulate high systemic BA levels and exhibit fat loss. Here, we demonstrate that chronic exposure to pathological BA levels results in mitochondrial dysfunction and defective thermogenesis. Consistently, both DKO and DDC-fed mice exhibit lower body temperature. Importantly, thermoneutral (30 °C) housing of the cholestatic DKO mice rescues the decrease in brown fat mass, and the expression of genes responsible for lipogenesis and regulation of mitochondrial function. To overcome systemic effects, primary adipocyte cultures were treated with pathological BA concentrations. Mitochondrial permeability and respiration analysis revealed that BA overload is sufficient to reduce mitochondrial function in primary adipocytes, which is not as a result of cytotoxicity. Instead, we found robust reductions in uncoupling protein 1 (<i>Ucp1</i>), PR domain containing 16 (<i>Prdm16</i>)<i>,</i> and deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II (<i>Dio2</i>) transcripts in brown adipocytes upon treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, whereas taurocholic acid led to the suppression of <i>Dio2</i> transcript. This BA-mediated decrease in transcripts was alleviated by pharmacological activation of UCP1. High concentrations of BAs cause defective thermogenesis by reducing the expression of crucial regulators of mitochondrial function, including UCP1, which may explain the clinical features of hypothermia and fat loss observed in patients with cholestatic liver diseases. We uncover a detrimental effect of chronic bile acid overload on adipose mitochondrial function. Pathological concentration of different BAs reduces the expression of distinct genes involved in energy expenditure, which can be mitigated with pharmacological UCP1 activation.

[PMID: 27634226] The chaperone GRP78/BiP (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein) modulates protein folding in reply to cellular insults that lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study investigated the role of hypothalamic GRP78 on energy balance, with particular interest in thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, we used diet-induced obese rats and rats administered thapsigargin, and by combining metabolic, histologic, physiologic, pharmacologic, thermographic, and molecular techniques, we studied the effect of genetic manipulation of hypothalamic GRP78. Our data showed that rats fed a high-fat diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and metabolic phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors. This evidence indicates that modulation of hypothalamic GRP78 activity may be a potential strategy against obesity and associated comorbidities.

[PMID: 27488269] Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, and associated pathologies, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular alterations, are increasingly escalating morbidity and mortality. Despite intensive study, no effective simple treatment for these conditions exists. As such, the need for go-to drugs is serious. Bile acids (BAs) present the possibility of reversing these problems, as various in vivo studies and clinical trials have shown significant effects with regard to weight and obesity reduction, insulin sensitivity restoration and cardiovascular improvements. However, the mechanism of action of BA-induced metabolic improvement has yet to be fully established. The currently most accepted model involves non-shivering thermogenesis for energy waste, but this is disputed. As such, we propose to determine whether the BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) can exert anti-obesogenic effects in vitro, independent of thermogenic brown adipose tissue activation. By exposing differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes to high glucose and CDCA, we demonstrate that this BA has anti-obesity effects in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of metabolic pathways clearly indicates an improvement in metabolic status, as these cells become more oxidative rather than glycolytic, which may be associated with an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Our work demonstrates that CDCA-induced metabolic alterations occur in white and brown adipocytes and are not totally dependent on endocrine/nervous system signaling, as thought until now. Furthermore, future exploration of the mechanisms behind these effects will undoubtedly reveal interesting targets for clinical modulation.

[PMID: 41187384] Treatment for gaming disorder (GD) can be challenging due to comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187376] There is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of current hospital-based follow-up after treatment for gynaecological cancers. Moreover, patients often report their aftercare needs are unmet. In an era of increasing pressure on healthcare resources - alongside a growing emphasis on patient-empowerment and appropriate care - it is time to reconsider current follow-up practices for gynaecological cancer survivors. This has led to a growing body of research exploring new approaches to follow-up care in gynaecologic oncology. In this scoping review, we aim to explore these alternative follow-up approaches and evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to current follow-up care. The methodological framework for scoping studies by Arksey and O'Malley's was used, further guided by the PRISMA-ScR checklist. A literature search on follow-up care for gynaecological cancers was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid) and Cochrane Library. Included studies employed a comparative method, allowing assessment of alternative approaches relative to current follow-up. Data were charted according to the TIDieR checklist and guide for better reporting of interventions. Eighteen articles were included, identifying three categories of alternative follow-up strategies: nurse-led follow-up, reduced follow-up and patient-initiated follow-up. Across all categories, these approaches showed similar - and sometimes improved - effect on oncological outcomes, quality of life, and/or patient satisfaction, without increased costs and healthcare use. Follow-up care can be delivered in alternative ways, without compromising on patient experiences or oncological safety. This offers the possibility of more cost-effective and resource-efficient healthcare. These findings support the feasibility of using alternative follow-up strategies in gynaecological oncological care.

[PMID: 41187375] To compare cost-effectiveness of targeted therapeutic strategies for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHB) patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage endometrial cancer. A Markov-based cost-utility model using a third-party payer perspective compared concurrent and maintenance treatment strategies incorporating dostarlimab and trastuzumab for newly diagnosed stage III-IV endometrial cancer: chemotherapy alone; 3 universal immunotherapy strategies (universal concurrent and maintenance dostarlimab +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu-positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas); and 3 targeted immunotherapy strategies (dostarlimab for mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas). Costs (2024 USD), utilities, and clinical estimates were derived from published literature and the National Cancer Database. The base case analysis was a microsimulation with 10,000 runs, accompanied by a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 20,000 trials. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We performed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses on key parameters and analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. All targeted immunotherapy strategies were cost-effective compared to chemotherapy alone in both NHB and NHW, while universal immunotherapy was never cost-effective. Targeted strategies were more cost-effective in NHB than NHW. Targeted dostarlimab for dMMR plus trastuzumab for HER2 serous and carcinosarcomas was the most cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy, with an ICER of $119,945/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, assuming longer durations of treatment benefit resulted in lower ICERs. Personalized treatment strategies incorporating HER2 and MMR testing should be considered to optimize both cost-effectiveness and equity in care.

[PMID: 41187372] Efficient collection and treatment of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) from a pig manure tank was demonstrated in a full-scale biofilter designed for optimal biological CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation. The 400 m<sup>2</sup> biofilter consisted of a gas distribution layer and a compost-based oxidation layer. The biofilter removed on average 93 ± 6.5 % of the CH<sub>4</sub> loaded to the biofilter, corresponding to an annual reduction of 39 tons of CH<sub>4</sub>. The CH<sub>4</sub> load to the biofilter was lowest during early spring (0.5 kg h<sup>-1</sup>), when a small amount of manure was stored in the tank and the air temperature was reduced, and highest during summer (12.9 kg h<sup>-1</sup>), when the air temperature was high and the tank contained more manure. The biofilter CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation rate ranged between 32 and 650 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, with the maximum rate observed in August when the biofilter load was at its highest (774 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). Most of the time, CH<sub>4</sub> was completely oxidised in the gas distribution layer and the deepest part of the biofilter. When the CH<sub>4</sub> load exceeded 9 kg h<sup>-1</sup>, oxidation efficiency decreased to below 90 %. The optimal CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation temperature of the CH<sub>4</sub> oxidising community was 50 °C, which is close to the annual average temperature of 49 ± 1.7 °C. With a CO<sub>2</sub> shadow price of 9.90 € for reducing one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, the biofilter was revealed as a cost-efficient mitigation technology for reducing CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from manure storage tanks.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187346] The development of heterogeneous dirhodium catalysts for the synthesis of important bioactive organic compounds and the reduction of noble metal losses has long captivated significant research interest. To date, numerous strategies have been proposed for the heterogenization of dirhodium catalysts. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the preparation of heterogeneous dirhodium catalysts, categorizing these strategies into two primary types: axial binding at axial rhodium sites and equatorial modification through exchange of a bridging ligand. We place particular emphasis on emerging approaches, such as the incorporation of dirhodium units into self-supported coordination dirhodium frameworks. Additionally, the synthesis protocols, structural characterization, catalytic performance, and recyclability of these heterogenized systems are meticulously analyzed. This review aims to provide valuable insights and guidance for the design of novel and highly efficient immobilized dirhodium catalysts with the ultimate goal of facilitating their industrial applications.",10

Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187339] Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is a common endemic vector-borne disease in Asia that can lead to a range of systemic complications, including the rare but potentially life-threatening manifestation of acute pancreatitis. We conducted a systematic review of all reported cases of scrub typhus-associated acute pancreatitis from 1943 to 2024 using PubMed, including English, Japanese, and Chinese literature, and analyzed a total of 14 cases, including one newly identified case at our institution. Diagnostic criteria were based on compatible clinical features, elevated pancreatic enzymes, and characteristic imaging findings. The median age of patients was 47 years (range 22-75), with 69.2% of patients being male. The most frequent clinical manifestations were fever (100%), abdominal pain (92.3%), and thrombocytopenia (30.8%). Over one-third of the patients developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or shock, and the mortality rate was 23.1%, with all fatalities occurring in patients with MODS. Most patients received doxycycline or azithromycin along with supportive care. The newly reported case presented with rapidly progressive pancreatitis requiring intensive care and multiple organ support, but the patient eventually recovered. These findings highlight that acute pancreatitis is an underrecognized yet severe complication of scrub typhus, often associated with poor outcomes when MODS is present. Clinicians in endemic regions should consider pancreatitis in the differential diagnoses when evaluating scrub typhus patients with abdominal symptoms or systemic inflammation. Prompt recognition and timely, aggressive management may improve survival and reduce complications in affected patients.

[PMID: 41187302] Major adverse cardiovascular events resulting from atherosclerotic plaque instability account for a plurality of deaths worldwide despite the use of highly effective lipid lowering therapies. Over the last three decades, the role of inflammation in atherogenesis has been tested extensively. Although preclinical studies demonstrate a clear role for inflammation in atherogenesis, clinical studies using global anti-inflammatory therapies have not been as successful as hoped, encouraging the search for new therapeutic strategies. Thanks to the advent of cell-specific lineage tracing, we have begun to appreciate the multifaceted role of smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching in modulating plaque stability. Here, we review the mechanisms controlling smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching during early and late-stage pathogenesis, which may inspire future therapies to stabilize plaques.

[PMID: 41187293] Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fatal disease. Current clinically approved treatments slow disease progression but are not curative. Thus, there is a critical need to better define the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF and develop novel approaches to treat this devastating lung condition. Immune dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, accompanied by fibrosis, constitutes a key hallmark of IPF. IPF is generally considered to be a fibroproliferative disorder rather than an immune condition because, historically, immunomodulatory therapies have failed to produce significant clinical effect. This lack of response is frustrating given that there is evidence of immune dysfunction in IPF and highlights the need to clarify the role of immune cells and inflammatory pathways in IPF. There is increasing evidence that the extracellular matrix (ECM) directs cell fate and function, and we propose that ECM remodeling and immune dysfunction in IPF generate a self-perpetuating fibrotic circuit that is refractory to classical anti-inflammatory agents. Understanding the relationship between ECM and immune dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis could help identify novel therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187245] Identifying the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a cornerstone of preventive medical care. Despite its significance, limited research has explored ASCVD risk in individuals with fibrotic skin diseases. This study aims to evaluate the risk of ASCVD in patients diagnosed with fibrotic skin conditions. We utilized the TriNetX platform to analyze ASCVD risk associated with fibrotic skin conditions. Propensity score-matched (PSM) cohorts were constructed to adjust for confounding. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Patients with fibrotic skin diseases demonstrated an elevated risk of ASCVD. Scleroderma was most strongly associated with ASCVD risk (HR 2.51 [95% CI: 1.97,3.21]), followed by hypertrophic scar (HR 1.40 [95% CI: 1.20,1.63]). Elevated risks were also observed for morphea (HR 1.36 [95% CI: 1.03,1.08]) and lichen sclerosis (HR 1.30 [95% CI: 1.04,1.62]). Individuals with fibrotic skin conditions, including scleroderma, hypertrophic scars, morphea, and lichen sclerosis, demonstrate an increased risk of ASCVD. These findings highlight the significance of recognizing fibrotic skin diseases as possible indicators of systemic inflammation.

[PMID: 41187240] Nicotinamide (niacinamide) is the water-soluble form of vitamin B3. Nicotinamide plays a crucial physiological role as a catalyst for various molecular reactions in the body and is a common over-the-counter supplement. In dermatology, oral nicotinamide has a long history of diverse applications. Oral nicotinamide mitigates ultraviolet-induced immunosuppression, serves as adjunctive therapy for blistering skin disorders, reduces inflammation and sebum in acne vulgaris, and has been used for pruritic disorders. Recent studies indicate that terminal metabolites of nicotinamide may contribute to vascular inflammation and elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly at doses exceeding therapeutic recommendations of 500 mg. Given the wide range of applications of nicotinamide in dermatology, we aim to investigate the effects of oral nicotinamide on cardiovascular health. A review of the literature was conducted to assess the dermatological benefits of oral nicotinamide as well as its potential cardiovascular risks, particularly at high doses. Evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses was evaluated to synthesize current knowledge on its safety and efficacy. Oral nicotinamide has demonstrated significant benefits in dermatological practice, including reducing the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers in immunocompetent individuals and improving outcomes in various inflammatory skin conditions. However, recent evidence suggests that increased serum levels of nicotinamide's terminal metabolites N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide leads to increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular effects. While oral nicotinamide remains a valuable option in dermatological practice, clinicians should exercise caution in prescribing this at high doses due to the potential cardiovascular risks.

[PMID: 41187235] Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a complex skin condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Increasing evidence points to diet as a key contributor to disease severity through systemic inflammatory pathways. A review of recent literature was conducted to evaluate the relationship between dietary patterns and advancement of HS. Pro-inflammatory diets such as the Western diet, leucine-rich diets, and brewer's yeast were associated with HS exacerbation through mTOR activation and hormonal dysregulations. In contrast, anti-inflammatory agents such as the Mediterranean diet, very low-calorie ketogenic diet, and dairy-free diets showed promising results in mitigating HS flares. Supplementation with vitamin D and zinc also demonstrated clinical improvement in patients with documented deficiencies. Recent research suggests that fasting may help reduce inflammation and ease HS symptoms. This review seeks to synthesize recent literature, offer diet-specific management insights, and identify existing gaps in research and literature regarding diet and HS.",10
Cognitive behavioral therapy is an ineffective treatment for insomnia,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy AND Insomnia AND Ineffective Treatment AND Scientific Articles,"37198562,34393484,31246050,30794468,41187384,41187383,41187381,41187378,41187374,41187364","[PMID: 37198562] Up to 70% of breast cancer patients report symptoms of insomnia during and after treatment. Despite the ubiquity of insomnia symptoms, they are under-screened, under-diagnosed and poorly managed in breast cancer patients. Sleep medications treat symptoms but are ineffective to cure insomnia. Other approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, relaxation through yoga and mindfulness are often not available for patients and are complex to implement. An aerobic exercise program could be a promising treatment and a feasible option for insomnia management in breast cancer patients, but few studies have investigated the effects of such a program on insomnia. This multicenter, randomized clinical trial evaluate the effectiveness of a moderate to high intensity physical activity program (45 min, 3 times per week), lasting 12 weeks, in minimizing insomnia, sleep disturbances, anxiety/depression, fatigue, and pain, and in enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness. Patients with breast cancer be recruited from six hospitals in France and randomly allocated to either the ""training"" or the ""control"" group. Baseline assessments include questionnaires [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)], home polysomnography (PSG), and 7-day actigraphy coupled with completion of a sleep diary. Assessments are repeated at the end of training program and at six-month follow-up. This clinical trial will provide additional evidence regarding the effectiveness of physical exercise in minimizing insomnia during and after chemotherapy. If shown to be effective, exercise intervention programs will be welcome addition to the standard program of care offered to patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.

[PMID: 34393484] Chronic insomnia disorder, which affects 6-10% of the population, is diagnostically characterized by ongoing difficulties with initiating or maintaining sleep occurring at least three times per week, persisting for at least 3 months, and associated with daytime impairment. While chronic insomnia is often considered a condition primarily related to impaired sleep, the disorder can also adversely affect domains of physical and mental health, quality of life, and daytime function, which highlights the importance of treating the multidimensional sleep disorder. Owing to misperceptions about the safety and effectiveness of treatment options, many individuals with insomnia may not seek professional treatment, and alternatively use ineffective home remedies or over-the-counter medications to improve sleep. Some physicians may even believe that insomnia is remediated by simply having the patient ""get more sleep"". Unfortunately, treatment of insomnia is not always that simple. The disorder's complex underlying pathophysiology warrants consideration of different nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options. Indeed, recent insights gained from research into the pathophysiology of insomnia have facilitated development of newer treatment approaches with more efficacious outcomes. This narrative review provides a summary of the diagnostic criteria and pathophysiology of insomnia and its subtypes. Further, this review emphasizes new and emerging nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for chronic insomnia, including recent enhancements in approaches to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and the new dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) pharmacologics. These advances in treatment have expanded the treatment options and are likely to result in improved outcomes in patients with chronic insomnia.

[PMID: 31246050] Insomnia and nightmares are central features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, often they are inadequately assessed and ineffectively resolved following gold-standard PTSD treatment. Here we: (a) evaluate effects of prolonged exposure (PE) on subjectively measured sleep and (b) present pilot results of an examination of whether adding sleep interventions (imagery rehearsal therapy [IRT] and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia [CBT-I]) to PE improves treatment response, relative to PE alone, for night- and/or daytime PTSD symptoms among returning U.S. veterans and postdeployment personnel. In a parallel-groups, randomized controlled trial, participants received 12 sessions of PE followed by IRT (5 weeks) and CBT-I (7 weeks) or PE followed by 12 weeks supportive care therapy (SCT). PE did not improve sleep to a clinically meaningful degree, despite significant improvements in both Clinical Administered PTSD Scale and PTSD Checklist. Enhancing treatment with IRT/CBT-I led to greater improvements in insomnia (diary-recorded sleep efficiency) symptoms with large effect size, relative to SCT (<i>p</i> = .068, <i>d</i> = 1.07). There were large improvements in nightmare frequency relative SCT that did not reach statistical significance (<i>p</i> = .11, <i>d</i> = 0.90). Moreover, there was small improvement in daytime symptoms (Clinical Administered PTSD Scale) that did not reach statistical significance (<i>p</i> = .54, <i>d</i> = .31). The addition of targeted, validated sleep treatment improves effects of PE and improves nighttime symptoms. Thus, evidence-based sleep treatment should be considered in comprehensive PTSD treatment.

[PMID: 30794468] Insomnia is among the most reported sleep disturbances in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The pervasiveness of this disorder among trauma-inflicted civilians and military personnel has been associated with reduced quality of life, impaired psychosocial functioning including cognitive impairments, negative mood swings, cardiovascular complications, and increased utilization of medical services. This review describes the current state of science with respect to the impact of the most dispensed pharmacological interventions for posttraumatic insomnia. At the present, there are no established treatment algorithms for PTSD-related insomnia. Pharmacotherapy offers an alternative treatment modality for patients with PTSD who fail or decline cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Selection of a hypnotic/sedative agent should be based on the patient's history, precipitating and perpetuating factors of insomnia, side effect profile, and potential medication-related interactions. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines appear ineffective or are associated with significant harm in treating PTSD-related insomnia. In the absence of randomized controlled trials, prescription patterns have been guided by anecdotal reports and expert opinion. Due to the complexity and multifactorial etiology of insomnia in PTSD, clinical investigations should examine available pharmacologic agents in comparative trials or in combination with CBT or complementary therapies to assess both short-term and long-term sleep outcomes in this population.

[PMID: 41187384] Treatment for gaming disorder (GD) can be challenging due to comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

[PMID: 41187383] High breast density impairs mammographic cancer detection. We investigated if contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) performance is less affected by density compared to conventional mammography, addressing this critical gap. This study retrospectively included 326 adult female patients. The study protocol was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform. Each image was annotated and evaluated by a minimum of two expert radiologists, while a team of radiologists produced detailed medical reports and manual segmentation annotations for abnormal findings. The reference standards for lesion classification included follow-up assessments and pathological evaluations. The overall malignant breast lesion diagnosis for CESM yielded a sensitivity of 95.4 % (95 % CI = 92.4 %-97.5 %) and a specificity of 94.0 % (95 % CI = 91.8 %-95.7 %). Conventional mammography demonstrated a sensitivity of 85.0 % (CI = 80.5 %-88.8 %) and a specificity of 93.5 % (95 % CI = 91.3 %-95.3 %), which were both slightly lower than those achieved with CESM. In level A density, both conventional mammography and CESM demonstrated complete sensitivity and specificity. At density levels B, C, and D, CESM demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional mammography. Our findings indicate that as breast density transitions from fatty (level A) to dense (level D), CESM retains its sensitivity, while conventional mammography shows a decrease. Integrating CESM into clinics could enhance reporting systems and facilitate clinical decision-making, especially for patients with dense breast tissue. CESM showed superior diagnostic performance in the detection of malignant lesions compared to conventional mammography. CESM retains its diagnostic performance at varying levels of breast densities in contrast to conventional mammography.

[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187378] The high moisture content and perishability of the mulberry fruit restrict its high-value utilization. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) were extracted from mulberries using ultrasound-assisted acid, alkali, and enzymatic extraction processes. The structural and functional characteristics were systematically analyzed. The highest yield of SDF (23.61 %) obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction. Structural analysis showed that both IDF and SDF had a loose and porous structure with several exposed functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Functional experiments showed that IDF exhibited superior cholesterol- and nitrite-adsorption capacities compared with SDF. IDF and SDF obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities for glucose, cholesterol, and nitrite. In conclusion, ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction simultaneously enhances both the yield and functional properties of dietary fiber extracted from mulberry, providing an effective strategy for developing high-value functional ingredients and promoting sustainable utilization of the fruit.

[PMID: 41187374] The aim of this umbrella review was to synthesise existing evidence from systematic reviews on the impact of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on recovery in intensive care units. This umbrella review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidance, and its reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews statement. The search was carried out in the databases Medline®, CINAHL®, Scopus®, SciELO®, Web of Science®, Cochrane®, and SportDiscus®, using both indexed terms specific to each database and free-text terms. To assess the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews, the AMSTAR 2, tool was usedcovering 16 domains related to review design and reporting quality. The search was conducted with no temporal limits, until December 2024. A total of 21 systematic reviews were included. The most frequently assessed outcomes were muscle strength, muscle mass, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Muscle strength was the most extensively investigated outcome, with 11 reviews reporting positive effects. The analysis of primary study overlap revealed a moderate degree of overlap (6.71%). It is concluded that neuromuscular electrical stimulation is safe for critically ill patients, with positive effects on muscle strength, muscle mass, and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Although neuromuscular electrical stimulation demonstrates promising results in the rehabilitation of critically ill patients, the methodological quality of the available systematic reviews is variable. Therefore, there is a need for more robust and high-quality systematic reviews to strengthen the evidence base.

[PMID: 41187364] Threat perception is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, shaped by evolutionary pressures and modern environmental demands. While ancestral threats (e.g., snakes) have been shown to elicit stronger neural responses than modern threats (e.g., guns), less is known about how the brain processes airborne threats, such as depictions of individuals wearing face masks. This fMRI study investigates neural responses to ancestral, modern, and airborne threats to identify shared and distinct activation patterns. Sixty participants viewed visual stimuli from the three categories while undergoing fMRI scanning. Results showed heightened activation in the fear-processing network for all affective stimuli. In addition, activation of the ventral attention network was found for the ancestral threats. Modern threats elicited less intense responses, primarily engaging cortical regions associated with context-specific analysis. Notably, airborne threats elicited neural responses of similar intensity to ancestral threats but activated cortical regions overlapping with those for modern threats. This dual pattern highlights the brain's capacity to integrate evolutionary biases with socially constructed threat awareness. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing airborne threats as a unique category of threat processing, with implications for public health and mental well-being.",10

Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.

[PMID: 41186979] Messenger RNA (mRNA) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a transformative technology with broad applications in vaccines, protein replacement therapy, and gene editing. However, the transient nature of mRNA expression often necessitates high or repeated dosing regimens, limiting its therapeutic potential. Thus, there is a critical need for innovation at the interface of RNA biology and drug delivery that prolong the duration of RNA translation. In this Viewpoint, we provide an overview of emerging nucleic acid cargos that address these challenges, specifically self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA), and provide a framework for how these nucleic acid cargos can enable the next generation of vaccines and therapeutics for diverse clinical applications.

[PMID: 41186968] Rice cooking and eating quality (CEQ), a core agronomic trait tied to consumer preference and market value, is regulated by endosperm starch, protein, and lipid metabolism; this review synthesizes advances in its molecular mechanisms, focusing on genetic determinants and regulatory networks of storage substances. Starch is key: the Wx gene (central hub) has ≥ 9 allelic variants (e.g., Wxᵃ, Wxᵇ and Wx<sup>ela</sup>), modulating amylose content (AC) via GBSSI activity, Wx gene expression levels, splicing efficiency, etc., and exerting pleiotropic effects on protein/lipid metabolism, grain transparency, and taste; storage proteins (80% glutelin) harm CEQ by inhibiting starch gelatinisation, regulated by relevant gene families and vesicular pathways (e.g., Rab5a-VPS9a); lipids (0.3%-3% of endosperm) affect Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) profiles and aroma via genes like OsFAD, PDCT, FGC3; modules (e.g., OsNF-Ys, OsbZIP60, Ghd7-OsNAC42) balance starch-protein accumulation. Breeding strategies include marker-assisted selection, CRISPR/Cas9 editing of Wx elements or glutelin genes, gene pyramiding (Wx, ALK, GS3), and artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated intelligent breeding to boost efficiency; the review first proposes a framework: 'Wx genotype determination - amylopectin/glutelin regulation - CEQ improvement', and the establishment of this framework is rooted in the core role of the Wx gene in determining rice eating quality, which is achieved through its pleiotropic regulation of starch, protein, and lipid metabolism in the endosperm. Future directions: use Wx allelic diversity, decipher multi-omics modules (e.g., RNA methylation in starch metabolism), and integrate aroma, Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), grain shape, chalkiness, sugar transport genes to balance yield and CEQ for rice breeding.

[PMID: 41186660] Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have survival benefits for patients with high-risk (High-risk disease is defined per the phase III OlympiA trial as follows: for triple-negative breast cancer, residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or node-positive or ≥ 2 cm tumors after adjuvant chemotherapy; for hormone receptor-positive disease, four or more positive nodes after adjuvant chemotherapy or a CPS + EG score ≥ 3 after incomplete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The CPS + EG score accounts for clinical/pathologic stage, ER status, and grade (Giaquinto et al. in CA Cancer J Clin 72:524-541, 2022)), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer (eBC) with germline BReast CAncer gene mutations (gBRCAm). However, many patients are unaware of their gBRCA status; this can impact eligibility for targeted treatment. We sought to evaluate patient preferences for BRCA testing and treatment decision-making as they relate to HER2-negative eBC. We conducted an online survey, including a best-worst scaling exercise (BWS) and discrete-choice experiment (DCE), among patients with self-reported HER2-negative eBC residing in the USA who were either untested, unsure if they were tested, or tested positive for the gBRCAm. The BWS generated a rank ordering of 16 barriers and facilitators to BRCA testing. The DCE evaluated patient preferences for adjuvant therapies versus no treatment based on seven treatment attributes: invasive disease-free survival, targeted treatment, nausea risk, risk of serious side effects, regimen, treatment duration, and cost. BWS and DCE exercises were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian models. Among the 359 women included in our sample, the top facilitators for BRCA testing were determining eligibility for targeted therapy that may prevent or delay metastasis, a physician's recommendation, and absence of out-of-pocket costs (OOPC). In contrast, the top barriers were an OOPC of $250, potential anxiety from test results, and the possibility of a 3- to 4-week delay in treatment. The DCE showed that most participants preferred adjuvant treatment (77.6%) over no treatment, and reducing treatment OOPC from $900 to $0, reducing the risk of serious side effects from 77 to 24%, and having a BRCA-targeted treatment influenced treatment choice most. Individuals reported that a key benefit of BRCA testing was the insight it provided into their treatment options, allowing for more personalized care. However, OOPC was a barrier to testing. Their choice to receive adjuvant therapy was most influenced by OOPC, followed by the tolerability of the treatment and the ability to receive a targeted therapy.

[PMID: 41186282] <i>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</i> is a chemolithoautotrophic acidophilic bacterium widely found in industrial biomining operations. The cells obtain energy through iron and/or sulfur oxidation, and the resulting ferric iron can solubilize copper and other critical materials. The genetic engineering of acidophiles including <i>A. ferrooxidans</i> remains challenging due to limited molecular tools. In this study, we explored the feasibility of retron-based genetic engineering tools in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i> ATCC23270, leveraging a <i>pBAD</i> promoter system for inducible gene expression. We successfully expressed retron elements in <i>Escherichia coli</i> using the broad host pJRD215 plasmid and demonstrated both RNA and DNA antisense interference. We then expressed retron elements in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i> and targeted RNA antisense interference of the <i>PetA2</i> gene, which is a <i>bc</i>1 complex gene involved in the sulfur metabolism electron transport chain. Engineered strains exhibited reduced expression of sulfur oxidation genes and increased iron oxidation under high sulfur conditions, demonstrating retron-mediated regulation. While transcriptional interference was evident, genome editing in concert with the addition of a single-stranded annealing protein (SSAP), or recombineering, was not detected in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i>. These findings establish retrons as a viable new tool for genetic modulation in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i><i>,</i> suggesting a new capability for metabolic engineering of acidophilic extremophiles.

[PMID: 41186276] Activation of natural killer (NK) cells by transformed targets requires the engagement of activating receptors and commonly a concomitant loss of inhibitory signaling. While the coactivating receptor DNAM-1 is involved in NK cell recognition of tumors expressing the nectin-like molecule CD155, in many cancer types, high expression of CD155 is associated with a poor clinical prognosis. To assess the impact of ligand density on NK cell function, recognition of target cells expressing low and high levels of CD155 was compared. While low levels of CD155 on target cells augmented NK cell activation, most evident in elevated IFN-γ responses, high levels of CD155 drove rapid, activation-induced downregulation of DNAM-1 that did not result in enhanced IFN-γ responses. High levels of CD155 also drove TIGIT loss from the NK cell surface; however, gene editing of TIGIT from primary NK cells had no significant impact on target cell recognition. Although low levels of CD155 induced a degree of DNAM-1 loss, the improved activation was still mediated through DNAM-1, as assessed through selective disruption of the interaction. Similarly, NK cell recognition of targets expressing the nectin CD112, which also engages both DNAM-1 and TIGIT, resulted in modest loss of DNAM-1 expression and heightened IFN-γ responses. Together, these observations suggest that DNAM-1 recognition of its ligands is delicately poised such that low avidity receptor engagement augments NK cell activation, and in particular IFN-γ responses, while stronger engagement can result in the rapid downregulation of DNAM-1 without any significant enhancement of effector responses.

[PMID: 41185939] Despite the tremendous potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology in precision therapeutics, intracellular delivery remains a major challenge. High cytoplasmic viscosity and lysosomal entrapment significantly impair the cytosolic transport and gene-editing efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate that both the size and magnetic responsiveness of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters can be finely tuned by modulating ionic strength, enabling their rapid propulsion under external magnetic fields. Leveraging this property, we develop magnetic nanoparticle cluster nanorobots (MagCbots) of approximately 200 nm in size by electrostatically assembling Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoclusters with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids. Under magnetic actuation, MagCbots exhibit rapid rotation in highly viscous intracellular environments, achieving a linear velocity of ∼0.41 μm/s. MagCbots reduce intracellular viscosity by approximately 50% and enhance lysosomal escape efficiency by 3-fold compared to nonactuated counterparts. Their porous architecture not only offers high payload capacity but also protects plasmid DNA from enzymatic degradation. Notably, MagCbots enable efficient genome editing of both PD1 and PLK1 genes across various cell lines including hard-to-transfect Jurkat T cells. This magnetically driven nanorobot platform presents a promising strategy for active intracellular delivery and holds significant potential for advancing gene therapy and related biomedical applications.

[PMID: 41185139] Myhre syndrome is a rare, multisystemic disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SMAD4 gene, a key component of the TGF-β signaling pathway. These mutations lead to manifestations affecting neurodevelopment, bone and joint development, fibrosis and stenosis, immune responses, reproductive health, and cardiac function. The Myhre Syndrome Foundation (MSF) is a patient-centered organization focused on accelerating drug discovery while supporting patients, prioritizing research targeting fibrosis/stenosis and autism/intellectual and developmental disabilities, the most significant burdens reported by patients. Their short-term strategy involves: (1) Creating and running a preclinical platform to screen potential treatments using patient-derived and animal models. (2) Clinical readiness, addressing challenges associated with low disease incidence and heterogeneity in clinical trial design, by developing multi-domain endpoints, responder index, and biobanks/biomarkers. (3) Target identification investigating SMAD4 pathogenic variants rewiring protein-protein interactions in key signaling pathways. (4) Fostering partnerships with regulatory authorities, industries, and other patient research organizations.

[PMID: 41185093] Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the apoE4 isoform (C112R) represents the strongest genetic risk factor. We combined binding-site mapping and discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations to elucidate isoform-specific apoE-Aβ interactions. Computational peptide-array analysis identified Aβ-binding hotspots in the apoE4 N-terminal domain (NTD) around R112, conferring greater Aβ-binding propensity than apoE3. DMD simulations showed that apoE4 NTD is less stable and more solvent-exposed, resulting in stronger Aβ binding, especially near the mutation site. Upon binding apoE NTDs, Aβ exhibited an increased β-sheet content, suggesting a lowered fibril nucleation barrier. Incorporating these insights into a recently established thermodynamic-kinetic framework of amyloid aggregation rationalizes apoE's biphasic effect on Aβ aggregation: apoE retards Aβ fibrillization at low Aβ-concentrations via monomer sequestration but accelerates the process at high concentrations by facilitating nucleation. Our findings offer mechanistic insight into the APOE genotype-dependent modulation of Aβ aggregation and may inform genotype-specific therapeutic strategies for AD.

Cytochrome c is transferred from cytosol to the mitochondrial intermembrane space during apoptosis.,cytochrome c AND apoptosis AND mitochondrial intermembrane space AND transfer,"27934682,25278024,24114362,23931759,23347876,23150663,21967640,21739274,19409873,16325144","[PMID: 27934682] Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the main source of energy for metabolism. Mitochondria provide the majority of this ATP by a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. This process involves active transfer of positively charged protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane resulting in a net internal negative charge, known as the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm). The proton gradient is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP by fusing adenosine diphosphate and free phosphate. The net negative charge across a healthy mitochondrion is maintained at approximately -180 mV, which can be detected by staining cells with positively charged dyes such as tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). TMRE emits a red fluorescence that can be detected by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy and the level of TMRE fluorescence in stained cells can be used to determine whether mitochondria in a cell have high or low ΔΨm. Cytochrome c is essential for producing ΔΨm because it promotes the pumping the protons into the mitochondrial intermembrane space as it shuttles electrons from Complex III to Complex IV along the electron transport chain. Cytochrome c is released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol during apoptosis. This impairs its ability to shuttle electrons between Complex III and Complex IV and results in rapid dissipation of ΔΨm. Loss of ΔΨm is therefore closely associated with cytochrome c release during apoptosis and is often used as a surrogate marker for cytochrome c release in cells.

[PMID: 25278024] Cytochrome c is a multifunctional hemoprotein in the mitochondrial intermembrane space whereby its participation in electron shuttling between respiratory complexes III and IV is alternative to its role in apoptosis as a peroxidase activated by interaction with cardiolipin (CL), and resulting in selective CL peroxidation. The switch from electron transfer to peroxidase function requires partial unfolding of the protein upon binding of CL, whose specific features combine negative charges of the two phosphate groups with four hydrophobic fatty acid residues. Assuming that other endogenous small molecule ligands with a hydrophobic chain and a negatively charged functionality may activate cytochrome c into a peroxidase, we investigated two hydrophobic anionic analogues of vitamin E, α-tocopherol succinate (α-TOS) and α-tocopherol phosphate (α-TOP), as potential inducers of peroxidase activity of cytochrome c. NMR studies and computational modeling indicate that they interact with cytochrome c at similar sites previously proposed for CL. Absorption spectroscopy showed that both analogues effectively disrupt the Fe-S(Met(80)) bond associated with unfolding of cytochrome c. We found that α-TOS and α-TOP stimulate peroxidase activity of cytochrome c. Enhanced peroxidase activity was also observed in isolated rat liver mitochondria incubated with α-TOS and tBOOH. A mitochondria-targeted derivative of TOS, triphenylphosphonium-TOS (mito-VES), was more efficient in inducing H2O2-dependent apoptosis in mouse embryonic cytochrome c(+/+) cells than in cytochrome c(-/-) cells. Essential for execution of the apoptotic program peroxidase activation of cytochrome c by α-TOS may contribute to its known anti-cancer pharmacological activity.

[PMID: 24114362] In response to apoptotic stimuli, cytochrome c, an inter-membrane space protein is released from mitochondria to activate the cascade of caspases that leads to apoptosis. Recent evidence suggests that cytochrome c interacts with tRNA in the cytoplasm and this interaction was shown to inhibit the caspase mediated apoptotic process. Interestingly, cytochrome c does not contain any putative RNA binding domain. In this report, we sought to define the structural component of cytochrome c that is involved in binding of tRNA. By using gel mobility shift assays, we show that holocytochrome c can interact with tRNA but not apocytochrome c that lacks the heme domain suggesting that heme is essential for the interaction of cytochrome c to tRNA. In addition, using in vitro cross linking and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies, we show that cytochrome c can undergo heme mediated oligomerization. Prevention of heme mediated oligomerization of cytochrome c by potassium ferricyanide treatment prevents the binding of tRNA and promotes caspase activation. Our studies provide a novel regulation of apoptosis by heme dependent tRNA interaction to cytochrome c.

[PMID: 23931759] Cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondria-specific glycerophospholipid, is required for diverse mitochondrial processes and orchestrates the function of various death-inducing proteins during apoptosis. Here, we identify a complex of the p53-regulated protein TRIAP1 (p53CSV) and PRELI in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), which ensures the accumulation of CL in mitochondria. TRIAP1/PRELI complexes exert lipid transfer activity in vitro and supply phosphatidic acid (PA) for CL synthesis in the inner membrane. Loss of TRIAP1 or PRELI impairs the accumulation of CL, facilitates the release of cytochrome c, and renders cells vulnerable to apoptosis upon intrinsic and extrinsic stimulation. Survival of TRIAP1- and PRELI-deficient cells is conferred by an excess of exogenously provided phosphatidylglycerol. Our results reveal a p53-dependent cell-survival pathway and highlight the importance of the CL content of mitochondrial membranes in apoptosis.

[PMID: 23347876] Cyclosporine A (CsA) nephrotoxicity has been linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in renal cells. We have demonstrated that the antioxidant Vitamin E (Vit E) abolished renal toxicity in vivo and in vitro models. As one of the main sources of intracellular ROS are mitochondria, we studied the effects of CsA on several mitochondrial functions in LLC-PK1 cells. CsA induced ROS synthesis and decreased reduced glutathione (GSH). The drug decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and induced physiological modifications in both the inner (IMM) and the outer mitochondrial membranes (OMM). In the IMM, CsA provoked mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) and cytochrome c was liberated into the intermembrane space. CsA also induced pore formation in the OMM, allowing that intermembrane space contents can reach cytosol. Furthermore, CsA altered the mitochondrial dynamics, inducing an increase in mitochondrial fission; CsA increased the expression of dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) that contributes to mitochondrial fission, and decreased the expression of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and optic atrophy protein 1 (Opa1), proteins involved in the fusion process. All these phenomena were related to apoptosis. These effects were inhibited when cells were treated with the antioxidant Vit E suggesting that they were mediated by the synthesis of ROS.

[PMID: 23150663] The nucleoside diphosphate kinase Nm23-H4/NDPK-D forms symmetrical hexameric complexes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space with phosphotransfer activity using mitochondrial ATP to regenerate nucleoside triphosphates. We demonstrate the complex formation between Nm23-H4 and mitochondrial GTPase OPA1 in rat liver, suggesting its involvement in local and direct GTP delivery. Similar to OPA1, Nm23-H4 is further known to strongly bind in vitro to anionic phospholipids, mainly cardiolipin, and in vivo to the inner mitochondrial membrane. We show here that such protein-lipid complexes inhibit nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity but are necessary for another function of Nm23-H4, selective intermembrane lipid transfer. Mitochondrial lipid distribution was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using HeLa cells expressing either wild-type Nm23-H4 or a membrane binding-deficient mutant at a site predicted based on molecular modeling to be crucial for cardiolipin binding and transfer mechanism. We found that wild type, but not the mutant enzyme, selectively increased the content of cardiolipin in the outer mitochondrial membrane, but the distribution of other more abundant phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine) remained unchanged. HeLa cells expressing the wild-type enzyme showed increased accumulation of Bax in mitochondria and were sensitized to rotenone-induced apoptosis as revealed by stimulated release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, elevated caspase 3/7 activity, and increased annexin V binding. Based on these data and molecular modeling, we propose that Nm23-H4 acts as a lipid-dependent mitochondrial switch with dual function in phosphotransfer serving local GTP supply and cardiolipin transfer for apoptotic signaling and putative other functions.

[PMID: 21967640] Eukaryotic mitochondria resulted from symbiotic incorporation of α-proteobacteria into ancient archaea species. During evolution, mitochondria lost most of the prokaryotic bacterial genes and only conserved a small fraction including those encoding 13 proteins of the respiratory chain. In this process, many functions were transferred to the host cells, but mitochondria gained a central role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and in the modulation of metabolism; accordingly, defective organelles contribute to cell transformation and cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Most cell and transcriptional effects of mitochondria depend on the modulation of respiratory rate and on the production of hydrogen peroxide released into the cytosol. The mitochondrial oxidative rate has to remain depressed for cell proliferation; even in the presence of O₂, energy is preferentially obtained from increased glycolysis (Warburg effect). In response to stress signals, traffic of pro- and antiapoptotic mitochondrial proteins in the intermembrane space (B-cell lymphoma-extra large, Bcl-2-associated death promoter, Bcl-2 associated X-protein and cytochrome c) is modulated by the redox condition determined by mitochondrial O₂ utilization and mitochondrial nitric oxide metabolism. In this article, we highlight the traffic of the different canonical signaling pathways to mitochondria and the contributions of organelles to redox regulation of kinases. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of the mitochondrial population in cell cycle and apoptosis.

[PMID: 21739274] In valinomycin induced stimulation of mitochondrial energy dependent reversible swelling, supported by succinate oxidation, cytochrome c (cyto-c) and sulfite oxidase (Sox) [both present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (MIS)] are released outside. This effect can be observed at a valinomycin concentration as low as 1 nM. The rate of cytosolic NADH/cyto-c electron transport pathway is also greatly stimulated. The test on the permeability of mitochondrial outer membrane to exogenous cyto-c rules out the possibility that the increased rate of exogenous NADH oxidation could be ascribed either to extensively damaged or broken mitochondria. Accumulation of potassium inside the mitochondria, mediated by the highly specific ionophore valinomycin, promotes an increase in the volume of matrix (evidenced by swelling) and the interaction points between the two mitochondrial membranes are expected to increase. The data reported and those previously published are consistent with the view that ""respiratory contact sites"" are involved in the transfer of reducing equivalents from cytosol to inside the mitochondria both in the absence and the presence of valinomycin. Magnesium ions prevent at least in part the valinomycin effects. Rather than to the dissipation of membrane potential, the pro-apoptotic property of valinomycin can be ascribed to both the release of cyto-c from mitochondria to cytosol and the increased rate of cytosolic NADH coupled with an increased availability of energy in the form of glycolytic ATP, useful for the correct execution of apoptotic program.

[PMID: 19409873] Mitochondrial isoforms of creatine kinase (MtCK) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK-D) are not phylogenetically related but share functionally important properties. They both use mitochondrially generated ATP with the ultimate goal of maintaining proper nucleotide pools, are located in the intermembrane/cristae space, have symmetrical oligomeric structures, and show high affinity binding to anionic phospholipids, in particular cardiolipin. The structural basis and functional consequences of the cardiolipin interaction have been studied and are discussed in detail in this review. They mainly result in a functional interaction of MtCK and NDPK-D with inner membrane adenylate translocator, probably by forming proteolipid complexes. These interactions allow for privileged exchange of metabolites (channeling) that ultimately regulate mitochondrial respiration. Further functions of the MtCK/membrane interaction include formation of cardiolipin membrane patches, stabilization of mitochondria and a role in apoptotic signaling, as well as in case of both kinases, a role in facilitating lipid transfer between two membranes. Finally, disturbed cardiolipin interactions of MtCK, NDPK-D and other proteins like cytochrome c and truncated Bid are discussed more generally in the context of apoptosis and necrosis.

[PMID: 16325144] To assess the effect of lipids and lipid exchange in the pro-apoptotic release of cytochrome c, we investigated the ability of a plant lipid transfer protein (LTP) to initiate the apoptotic cascade at the mitochondrial level. The results show that maize LTP is able to induce cytochrome c release from the intermembrane space of mouse liver mitochondria without significant mitochondrial swelling, similarly to mouse full-length Bid. This effect is influenced by the presence of specific lipids, since addition of lysolipids like lysophosphatidylcholine strongly stimulates the LTP-induced release of cytochrome c while it is inhibited by removal of endogenous free lipids with a complete suppression of the LTP-induced release of cytochrome c. The results are discussed in light of the possible role of lipid exchange in apoptosis.",10

The group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by acute pulmonary vasoconstriction and chronic vascular remodeling caused by hyperplasia and hypertrophy of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and chronic inflammation. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory mode of cell death that is regulated by super-enhancers (SEs) and occurs in the setting of tumors and cardiovascular diseases. However, whether SEs are involved in the pathological process of pyroptosis in PAH and the specific mechanism involved remain unclear. Here, we identified the SE target gene DUSP4 via ChIP-seq with an anti-H3K27ac antibody, and bioinformatics predictions revealed that the transcription factor PITX1 can bind to the promoter and SE sequences of DUSP4. The AAV5 vector was used to deliver shRNAs targeting PITX1 and DUSP4 to PASMCs. PITX1 overexpression reversed the increase in right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary vascular remodeling, restored the PAAT/PAVTI ratio in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH, Group 3 PH) and SuHx PAH (Group 1 PAH) mice, and suppressed pyroptosis in pulmonary vascular cells. However, knockdown of DUSP4 counteracted the effects of PITX1 overexpression. Similar results were obtained in cultured PASMCs. In addition, treatment with the SE inhibitors JQ1 and iBET decreased the transcription of DUSP4 and increased the expression of hypoxia-induced pyroptosis proteins in PASMCs. We confirmed that PITX1 can promote DUSP4 expression by binding to the DUSP4 promoter and SE to reduce pyroptosis in hypoxic PASMCs, providing new insights into the role of SEs and pyroptosis in pulmonary vascular remodeling and a theoretical basis for the treatment of PAH and related diseases.

[PMID: 38824257] Previous studies have demonstrated that Dual-specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) plays an important role in the progression of different tumor types. However, the role and mechanism of DUSP4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. We investigate the role and mechanisms of DUSP4 in CRC. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate DUSP4 expression in CRC tissues. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration assays were used to validate DUSP4 function in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequence assay was used to identify the target genes of DUSP4. Human phosphokinase array and inhibitor assays were used to explore the downstream signaling of DUSP4. DUSP4 expression was upregulated in CRC tissues relative to normal colorectal tissues, and DUSP4 expression showed a significant positive correlation with CRC stage. Consistently, we found that DUSP4 was highly expressed in colorectal cancer cells compared to normal cells. DUSP4 knockdown inhibits CRC cell proliferation, migration and promotes apoptosis. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of DUSP4 enhanced CRC cell proliferation, migration and diminished apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Human phosphokinase array data showed that ectopic expression of DUSP4 promotes CREB activation. RNA-sequencing data showed that PRKACB acts as a downstream target gene of DUSP4/CREB and enhances CREB activation through PKA/cAMP signaling. In addition, xenograft model results demonstrated that DUSP4 promotes colorectal tumor progression via PRKACB/CREB activation in vivo. These findings suggest that DUSP4 promotes CRC progression. Therefore, it may be a promising therapeutic target for CRC.

[PMID: 36705792] The DUSP4 gene plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanism of DUSP4-regulated colorectal carcinogenesis is unknown. DUSP4 is a negative regulator of the MAP kinase (MAPK) JNK, and JNK-mediated BCL2 phosphorylation is associated with apoptosis and autophagic cell death. Our study aimed to explore the significance of BCL2 phosphorylation-dependent autophagy and apoptosis in DUSP4-promoted colorectal carcinogenesis. We first investigated the roles of DUSP4 in the survival of HCT116 and SW480 CRC cell lines using gene-silencing and -overexpression techniques. Next, we explored the effects of DUSP4 on the BCL2 phosphorylation, autophagy and apoptosis of HCT116 and SW480 cells. Ultimately, with the help of pharmacological inhibitors of Beclin1 and BCL2 (spautin-1 and ABT-737), the relationship between BCL2-Beclin1/Bax signaling and DUSP4-regulated autophagy, apoptosis, survival and migration in HCT116 cells was clarified. Our results first confirmed the contribution of DUSP4 to the survival of HCT116 and SW480 cells. In addition, DUSP4 silencing resulted in BCL2 phosphorylation and the enhancement in autophagy and apoptosis in HCT116 and SW480 cells, while DUSP4 overexpression showed the opposite effect. Moreover, DUSP4 silencing inhibited the protein interaction between BCL2 and Beclin1 or Bax in HCT116 cells. Moreover, the survival and migration of HCT116 cells inhibited by DUSP4 silencing were blocked by autophagy inhibition with spautin-1. Notably, the survival and migration of HCT116 cells promoted by DUSP4 overexpression were reversed by ABT-737. It was indicated that DUSP4 can maintain the survival and function of CRC cells by inhibiting BCL2 phosphorylation-dependent autophagic cell death and apoptosis.

[PMID: 36234680] Doxorubicin (Dox) has limited efficiency in breast cancer (BC) due to drug-acquired resistance. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a major role in the survival and drug resistance of cancer cells. It was suggested that the JNK pathway was implicated in the response to Dox by regulating EMT. DUSP4/or MKP-2 is a well-known regulator of the JNK pathway and was found to be highly expressed in BC. However, its functional significance is not yet fully understood. In the present study, the possible involvement of MKP-2 in Dox-induced EMT was investigated in breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry for tissues obtained from BC patients (<i>n</i> = 108) revealed 71.3% of tissues stained positively for MKP-2 while only 28.7% stained negatively. However, MKP-2 protein expression exhibited no significant relationship between BC prognostic factors, such as histological grade, histological type, hormonal status, and Ki-67 marker, its expression was significantly correlated with age 40 or below. In MDA-MB-231 cells, Dox-induced phosphorylation of JNK was sufficiently enhanced in MKP-2 silenced cells. This resulted in the attenuation of Dox-induced EMT, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately accelerated apoptosis. It was confirmed that the acquisition of Dox sensitivity by MKP-2 silencing largely depends on the stimulation of the JNK pathway. Indeed, results showed that overexpressing MKP-2 in non-tumorigenic MCF-12A cells dramatically inhibited Dox-induced JNK activation and, subsequently, cell death. The present study, to our knowledge, is the first to provide evidence for the potential role of MKP-2 in chemoresistance to Dox through modulating the JNK pathway and enhancing EMT.

[PMID: 35189148] A subset of dual-specificity phosphatases is a major negative regulator of MAPKs, and their involvement in tumorigenesis remains controversial. Among them, DUSP4 is reported to preferentially dephosphorylate extracellular signal‒regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase over p38. In this study, we aimed to identify a possible role of DUSP4 in melanoma genesis. An examination of large-scale public data on gene expression and dependency revealed a considerably high DUSP4 expression and dependency of the melanoma cell lines compared with those of other tumor cell lines, which was not apparent for the other 24 dual-specificity phosphatases genes encoded in the human genome. Using two melanoma lines, we confirmed that DUSP4 depletion impaired cell growth without notably inducing apoptosis. Interestingly, immunoblotting and kinase translocation reporter data revealed that DUSP4 depletion induces a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation but barely affects c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, suggesting that neither ERK nor c-Jun N-terminal kinase is a direct target of DUSP4 in our experimental setting. Notably, DUSP4 depletion led to an increase in DUSP6 level, possibly through a post-transcriptional process, and DUSP6 knockout almost eliminated the DUSP4-depletion effect on cell growth and ERK activity. Our findings suggest that DUSP4 plays a role in maintaining a high ERK1/2 activity by negatively regulating DUSP6 and thus contributes to the survival and growth of melanoma cells.

[PMID: 35069911] Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the sixth most common cancer type in East Asian countries. Mounting evidences illustrated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in a variety of human cancers, including ESCC. LncRNA <i>PCAT6</i> has been identified as a tumor promoter in multiple cancers. However, the roles and underlying mechanism of <i>PCAT6</i> in ESCC remain largely unclear. In the current study, we discovered that lncRNA <i>PCAT6</i>, which was aberrantly upregulated in ESCC tumor tissues, significantly promoted cell proliferation and migration in ESCC cell lines Eca-109 and Kyse-30 cells. Flow cytometry assays showed that <i>PCAT6</i> knockdown promoted the apoptosis of ESCC cells. Mechanistically, RNA-seq and Gene Ontology analyses indicated that <i>PCAT6</i> knockdown influenced the expression of genes that participated in cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, real-time PCR and western blot assays validated that knockdown of <i>PCAT6</i> could increase the levels of <i>GDF15</i> and <i>DUSP4</i> in Eca-109 and Kyse-30 cells. In brief, our findings reveal that lncRNA <i>PCAT6</i> plays an oncogenic role in the progression of ESCC by inhibiting the expression of genes related to cell proliferation and migration.

[PMID: 33760201] MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play an important role in regulating the occurrence and development of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). miR‑122‑5p is widely considered a tumour inhibitor, which has not been fully explored in PTC. Bioinformatics analysis identified dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), a tumour promoter gene for PTC, as a downstream target of miR‑122‑5p. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of miR‑122‑5p in PTC oncogenesis. In this study, the expression pattern of miR‑122‑5p in PTC cancer tissues and PTC cell lines was investigated via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the roles of miR‑122‑5p in PTC were explored using gain‑of‑function and loss‑of‑function assays. The results revealed that the expression of miR‑122‑5p was significantly lower in PTC cancer tissues, especially in cancer tissues with significant invasion or metastasis. Overexpression of miR‑122‑5p caused by miR‑122‑5p mimics inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of the PTC cell line K1, while knockdown of miR‑122‑5p by miR‑122‑5p inhibitors exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> assays revealed that miR‑122‑5p overexpression inhibited tumour growth. In addition, miR‑122‑5p was negatively correlated with DUSP4 expression in PTC cancer tissues. miR‑122‑5p overexpression inhibited DUSP4 expression in K1 cells, while miR‑122‑5p downregulation produced the inverse effect. Specifically, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding sites of miR‑122‑5p on the 3'‑UTR of DUSP4, demonstrating the targeting effect of miR‑122‑5p on DUSP4. miR‑122‑5p inhibited the oncogenesis of PTC by targeting DUSP4, revealing the potential application value of miR‑122‑5p in the diagnosis and treatment of PTC.

[PMID: 32470454] The aim of this study was to explore the role of miR-122-5p in acute lung injury. Mice were subjected to intratracheal injection of lipopolysaccharide to establish an acute lung injury model. The mice also received miR-122-5p antagonist and mimic via injection to inhibit or overexpress miR-122-5p in the lung tissue, respectively. In an in vitro experiment, we isolated primary mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells and established a cell injury model via lipopolysaccharide treatment. Mice injected with an miR-122-5p antagonist exhibited reduced lung injury, inflammation and oxidative stress, while mice injected with a miR-122-5p mimic exhibited exaggerated lung injury, inflammation and oxidative stress. In an in vitro experiment, we found that the miR-122-5p antagonist suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress. Moreover, miR-122-5p regulated the promoter activity of DUSP4, which negatively regulated ERK1/2 signaling. The use of DUSP4 siRNA counteracted the effects of the miR-122-5p antagonist. Taken together, these results show that miR-122-5p protected against acute lung injury via regulation of DUSP4/ERK signaling in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. MiR-122-5p antagonism may be a promising treatment method for acute lung injury.

[PMID: 31799639] Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been indicated to play an important role in many different diseases. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease which causes a change of morphology and function in articular cartilage and synovium, leading to cartilage degradation. Synovitis is a common pathological feature of OA, owing to the proliferation of synoviocytes. In this research, we want to verify the role of lncRNA ANRIL in osteoarthritis. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of lncRNA ANRIL in normal synoviocytes and osteoarthritis synoviocytes. The cell proliferation in normal synoviocytes and osteoarthritis synoviocytes after transfection with lncRNA-NC or lncRNA-ANRIL were tested. The apoptosis rate and cell cycle in normal synoviocytes and osteoarthritis synoviocytes were detected by the Flow Cytometry analysis. Western blot was used to analyze the possible mechanism that ANRIL regulated the cells' proliferation in osteoarthritis. We indicated that the expression of ANRIL was significantly improved in OAS compared to NS. The expression of ANRIL was decreased and the cell proliferation was reduced in OAS after transfected with siRNA. And the cell cycle was suspended in G0/G1 phase and the cell apoptosis was improved in OAS after transfected with siRNA. Moreover, ANRIL could regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of OAS via miR-122-5p/DUSP4 axis. We suggest that lncRNA ANRIL was closely related to osteoarthritis. ANRIL may be involved in the development and progression of osteoarthritis and become a potential target for diagnosis and treatment in OA.

[PMID: 31258782] <b>Background</b>: Sorafenib appears to increase the survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, but its response rate is seriously limited due to drug resistance. Molecular mechanisms underlying sorafenib resistance are still unknown. Herein, we explored the possible role of miR-1226-3p in sorafenib resistance of HCC. <b>Methods</b>: The miR-1226-3p expression level in HCC cell lines was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Cell viabilities to sorafenib were measured by CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis and proliferation were detected by flow cytometry and EdU proliferation assay. A luciferase reporter of DUSP4 3'-UTR was used for validation as a target gene of miR-1226-3p. Finally, the effects of <i>in vivo</i> antitumor efficacy of miR-1226-3p combined with sorafenib were evaluated by HCC tumor xenografts in nude mice. <b>Results</b>: Bioinformatics analysis from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE56059 suggested that miR-1226-3p expression was downregulated in HCC patients who showed progressive disease (PD) after sorafenib treatment. SK-HEP-1 cells expressed lower levels of miR-1226-3p than HepG2 cells. We confirmed that SK-HEP-1 cells were more resistant to sorafenib compared to HepG2 cells. In addition, miR-1226-3p mimic increased cell apoptosis of SK-HEP-1 cells, whereas miR-1226-3p inhibitor significantly impaired cell apoptosis of HepG2 cells after sorafenib treatment. Moreover, we validated that miR-1226-3p directly targeted dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), and further demonstrated that knockdown of DUSP4 reduced sorafenib resistance by regulating the JNK-Bcl-2 axis. <b>Conclusions</b>: miR-1226-3p promotes sorafenib sensitivity of HCC through downregulation of DUSP4 expression, and targeting miR-1226-3p may be a novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming sorafenib resistance.",10

Diabetes mellitus however, is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, but diabetic patients seldom develop AAA. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Increased aortic wall stress seems to be an etiologic factor in the formation, growth and rupture of AAA in man. The aim of our study was to study the wall stress in the abdominal aorta in diabetic patients compared with healthy controls. 39 patients with diabetes mellitus and 46 age - and sex matched healthy subjects were examined with B-mode ultrasound to determine the lumen diameter (LD) and intima-media thickness (IMT) in the abdominal aorta (AA) and the common carotid artery (CCA). Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was measured non-invasively in the brachial artery. LaPlace law was used to calculate circumferential wall stress. Age, DBP, and LD in the abdominal aorta were not significantly different in the diabetic patients compared to controls. IMT in the AA was larger in the diabetic patients, 0.89+/-0.17 vs 0.73+/-0.11 mm (p<.001). Accordingly aortic wall stress was reduced in the diabetics, 7.8+/-1.7 x 10(5) vs 9.7+/-1.9 x 10(5)dynes/cm(2) (p<.001). Wall stress in the abdominal aorta is reduced in diabetes mellitus. This is mainly due to a thicker aortic wall compared to healthy controls. The reduced aortic wall stress coincides with the fact that epidemiological studies have shown a decreased risk of aneurysm development in diabetic patients.

[PMID: 41187128] The autonomic nervous system (ANS) dynamically regulates the internal environment to maintain homeostasis. The ANS exhibits some forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and plastic changes in neurotransmitter distribution, both of which may contribute to autonomic function. Dysautonomia refers to an abnormality in the function of the ANS, with an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Dysautonomia has been reported in conditions such as stress, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and premature death. In MS, the signs of dysautonomia include elevated plasma norepinephrine levels and increased arterial blood pressure. In this study, we characterized the effect of a high-sucrose diet (HSD) on synaptic plasticity in sympathetic ganglia of the rat by measuring LTP expression in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and analyzing the expression of acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA, as well as their balance of colocalization/segregation in ganglionic nerve terminals. The HSD consists of adding 30% sucrose to drinking water, which is an accepted model of MS. We observed an impairment in LTP expression, along with a decrease in ACh presence and a reduction in its segregation from GABA. These findings suggest the emergence of an inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission and plasticity within the SCG. We propose that dysautonomia associated with MS might involve changes in sympathetic activity, at least at the level of ganglionic cholinergic transmission. These results may help to improve our understanding of autonomic dysfunction in the context of this metabolic disorder.

[PMID: 41186511] Hysteroscopic myomectomy is a common procedure for treating submucosal leiomyomas, but fluid overload and subsequent pulmonary edema are significant complications. This study investigates whether phenylephrine-induced increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) can reduce pulmonary edema and distension fluid absorption in patients undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 44 patients scheduled for hysteroscopic myomectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either phenylephrine infusion to maintain MAP at 100%-120% of the baseline value or normal saline infusion during surgery. The primary outcome was the incidence of pulmonary edema assessed by lung ultrasound (LUS). Secondary outcomes included B-line scores, thoracic fluid content (TFC), distension fluid deficit, use of furosemide, and so on. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed in distention fluid deficit, andΔTFC to predict pulmonary edema. The phenylephrine group showed a significantly lower incidence of pulmonary edema (18.2% vs. 54.6%, RR = 0.33, 95%CI [0.13 to 0.81], P = 0.027) and lower LUS B-line scores (MD = - 4.5, 95%CI [0 to 9], P = 0.016) compared to the control group. Additionally, the phenylephrine group had significantly reduced distension fluid deficit (P = 0.018), lower TFC at the end of operation (P = 0.008), and decreased use of furosemide (P = 0.022). Best cut-off value in diagnosis pulmonary edema were 1900 ml for distention fluid deficit, and 7.1/kΩ for ΔTFC and area under the ROC curve were 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. Phenylephrine administration during hysteroscopic myomectomy effectively reduces pulmonary edema and distension fluid absorption by increasing MAP. This study provides evidence for a new strategy in intraoperative fluid management for hysteroscopic surgeries.

[PMID: 41186208] This study aimed to assess the accuracy of the CONTEC08C automated oscillometric upper-arm sphygmomanometer in adults for clinical use in accordance with the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard. A total of 90 normotensive and hypertensive participants aged 18-75 years were recruited, and 85 were analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the CONTEC08C oscillometric upper-arm sphygmomanometer using the same arm sequential validation method and a standardized protocol. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the differences between the test device and reference blood pressure (BP) measurements was 0.5 ± 3 mmHg for SBP and 0.4 ± 3.5 mmHg for DBP, meeting validation criterion 1. For validation criterion 2, the SD of the averaged differences between the test device and reference BP measurements per subject was 1.81/2.41 mmHg (systolic/diastolic). The CONTEC08C oscillometric upper-arm blood pressure monitor fulfilled the requirements of the ISO 81060-2:2018 standard in adults in the clinical setting and can therefore be recommended for safe clinical use.

[PMID: 41185995] Ang II (angiotensin II) causes hypertension and vascular inflammation both directly and indirectly via cytokines, including TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α). In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), Ang II and TNFα activate Nox1 (NADPH oxidase 1) to produce superoxide. TNFα receptors associate with Nox1 and LRRC8A (leucine-rich repeat containing 8A) anion channels to modulate inflammation and contractility in a RhoA-dependent manner. VSMC-specific LRRC8A knockout mesenteric arteries are protected from TNFα-induced injury, and vasodilation is preserved. We hypothesized that LRRC8A knockout would preserve vascular function and decrease blood pressure (BP) in Ang II-infused mice. Wild-type and knockout mice received Ang II infusions for 14 days. BP was measured by radiotelemetry, and aortic and mesenteric artery function was measured by wire myography. VSMCs were isolated from male wild-type and knockout mice. Systolic BP was not different, but knockout mice had more BP dipping during inactive periods at baseline, and dipping was preserved after Ang II. The function of knockout aortic and mesenteric vessels was less impaired by Ang II, as reflected by less augmented contraction to norepinephrine and serotonin and preserved relaxation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Western blotting revealed increased soluble guanylate cyclase alpha and reduced CPI-17 in hypertensive knockout aortae. Consistent with lower Rho kinase activity, phosphorylation of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) and cofilin was reduced in knockout VSMCs. Ang II caused less proliferation (lower PCNA [proliferating cell nuclear antigen]) and less induction of senescence in knockout vessels. LRRC8A anion channels support VSMC inflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction, which impairs BP dipping in hypertension.

[PMID: 41185804] Context Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an abnormal host response to infection, resulting in multiple organ failure and high mortality rates. Secondary or type five cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) emerges as a consequence of systemic infection, resulting in both cardiac and renal dysfunction. The synergistic impact of inflammation and hemodynamic instability results in an adverse cycle of vital organs damage during which renal impairment further aggravates cardiac dysfunction and vice versa. Objectives The objective of this study is to assess the influence of specified demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters on the hospitalization outcome of patients who fulfilled CRS-5/Sepsis-3/KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) from March 2022 to September 2024 (30 months). Methods The observational study comprised 41 patients treated at Zemun University Clinical Hospital's medical ICU (mICU). The inclusion criteria were a positive blood culture, elevated procalcitonin (Pct) levels, and clinical and laboratory evidence of heart and renal failure in the presence of sepsis. The cohort of patients was divided into two groups (survivors and deaths) based on hospitalization outcomes. Epidemiological (gender, age, duration of hospital stay), clinical (systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), ejection fraction (EF), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT)), and laboratory (white blood cells (WBC) and platelet (Plt) counts, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, Pct, urea, creatinine, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin (Tn)) parameters were examined. The obtained data were analyzed using the statistical package SPSS for Windows 22.0. Results The study cohort had an average age of 70 years (43-84 years), with 22 (54%) female patients. Out of 41 patients, 14 (34%) survived and 27 (66%) died. The values of SBP and APACHE II score, as well as the duration of hospital stay, statistically differed between the two groups (p=0.009, p=0.000, and p=0.000, respectively) and had a significant impact on hospitalization outcome (p=0.007, p=0.000, and p=0.000, respectively). Conclusion According to the findings, patients with sepsis and type five CRS had a significant mortality rate (66%). Low SBP, a higher APACHE II score, and a shorter duration of hospital stay are significant predictors of unfavorable outcomes. Additional research and the development of clinical guidelines are required to improve the prognosis of such patients.

[PMID: 41184674] Robotic surgery demands specialized training to ensure proficiency and patient safety. Deliberate practice using Virtual Reality (VR) robotic simulation platforms provides a safe method for skill acquisition. The first part of our Initial curriculum (IC) consisted of 33 VR drills on the SimNow Simulator, which was refined in 2021 to 19 VR drills using a Simulation-Based Mastery Learning (SBML) approach. This study evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of our refined curriculum (RC). A total of 87 general surgery residents were included. IC was completed by 41 residents, while 46 residents completed the RC. Metrics such as console time, pre- and post-test VR drill scores, and inanimate drill performance were assessed. Statistical analyses included independent or paired t-tests and Mann-Whitney U, or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests for non-parametric data. In the IC, 83% of participants achieved mastery versus 100% in the RC. Mean console training time was significantly reduced from 7 h 6 m (95% CI: 6.20-7.92) in the IC to 5 h 42 m (95% CI: 4.74-6.10) in the RC (p = 0.005), demonstrating enhanced efficiency. For VR drills, the IC median score improved from 62 (126-28) to 353 (366-317) (p < 0.001), with a median time reduction of 847 s (1169-565) (p < 0.001). In the RC, the median test score improved from 65.5 (138.75-37.75) to 344.5 (365.5-291.25) (p < 0.001), with a median time reduction of 999 s (1449.5-548.25) (p < 0.001). Inanimate drill times also improved: the IC median time decreased from 928.5 s (1066-853.5) to 741.5 s (859-613.5) (p < 0.001), while the RC median time decreased from 909.5 s (1037.7-744.7) to 464.5 s (518-413.7) (p < 0.001). Reducing VR drills from 33 to 19 content-aligned drills with new proficiency benchmarks maintained effectiveness while significantly decreasing VR console training time. These findings support the feasibility of implementing this streamlined robotic training curriculum in general surgery residency programs without compromising skill acquisition.

[PMID: 41184626] Liraglutide, an analog of glucagon-like peptide-1, is prescribed for managing weight in obese people. This meta-analysis investigated whether liraglutide was suitable for younger children with obesity, and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of varying treatment durations and dosage regimens. Randomized controlled trials published up to March 20, 2025 were retrieved from in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Seven trials involving 575 patients were included in the analysis. Liraglutide significantly decreased body mass index (BMI) (WMD: -0.57; P = 0.007), BMI z-score (WMD: -0.45; P < 0.00001), body weight (WMD: -0.31; P = 0.0004), HbA1c (WMD: -0.43; P = 0.004), fasting plasma glucose (WMD: -1.23; P = 0.003) and systolic blood pressure (WMD: -0.20; P = 0.03) compared with placebos in obese children and adolescents. Subgroup analyses found that children 6-12 years of age did not have a significantly different BMI z-score (z = 1.76; P = 0.08) and body weight (z = 1.75; P = 0.08) versus adolescents. Fifty-six weeks of liraglutide treatment (z = 4.60; P < 0.00001) significantly reduced the BMI z-score versus the short-term treatment group (<13 weeks) (z = 1.20; P = 0.23). Liraglutide was an effective and safe option for managing overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. Liraglutide was more suitable for adolescents and is endorsed for long-term use. This is the first meta-analysis to explore the suitability of liraglutide for younger children with obesity and to evaluate its efficacy and safety across varying treatment durations and dosage regimens. Earlier meta-analyses did not include children under 12 years, and neither dosage nor treatment duration was specifically addressed. Our result shows liraglutide is an effective and safe option for managing overweight and obesity in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. Liraglutide was more suitable for adolescents and is endorsed for long-term use.

[PMID: 41184435] Previous studies have revealed a link between serum uric acid (SUA) and homocysteine (Hcy) levels, but it is unclear whether such relationship can be mediated by metabolic risk factors. This study evaluated the relationship between SUA and Hcy levels through a mediation analysis, examining the extent to which metabolic risk factors mediate this association. A total of 16,870 participants aged 20-60 years was consecutively enrolled at the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. Data on health behaviours and medical history were collected through self-reported health questionnaires. Laboratory examinations were conducted by trained personnel via standardized methods. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between SUA and Hcy levels. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore the possible impact of metabolic risk factors on the SUA-Hcy relationship. There was a significant dose‒response relationship between higher SUA quartiles and increased hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) risk (P for trend < 0.01). Mediation analysis indicated that the relationship between SUA and HHcy was partially mediated by triglyceride (TG, 10.78%), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, 10.12%), systolic blood pressure (SBP, 7.63%), body mass index (BMI, 6.02%), and total cholesterol (TC, 0.56%); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) negatively mediated this association, accounting for 13.03% of the effect. SUA is positively associated with HHcy risk and potentially mediated by metabolic factors such as HDL-C, TG, DBP, SBP, and BMI.

[PMID: 41184332] Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) progression carries a significant rupture risk, demanding accurate prediction models beyond traditional methods that rely on limited clinical parameters and often overlook complex factor interplay. We aimed to enhance prediction by developing and validating an end-to-end multi-modal deep learning (DL) model that integrates features extracted using ResNet from computed tomography (CT) images, geometric features derived from radiomics based on CT annotations, and clinical features obtained from clinical records. This retrospective study utilized data from 561 AAA patients sourced from Boramae Medical Center and Seoul National University Hospital, including 14,252 annotated CT axial images alongside detailed clinical information. Patients were categorized into rapid or slow progression groups based on an annual growth rate threshold of 2.5 mm/year. The multi-modal DL model that incorporated CT images, clinical features, and geometric features demonstrated superior predictive performance for rapid progression, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.807 and an accuracy of 0.758. This significantly outperformed traditional machine learning models utilizing only clinical data (AUC: 0.716) or only geometric features (AUC: 0.715). The improvement in AUC was statistically significant according to DeLong's test. This study underscores the value of AI-driven, multi-modal approaches for enhancing patient-specific AAA risk stratification, potentially enabling more precise monitoring and optimized timing for clinical interventions.",10
Deltex has no known interactions with eIF3f.,Deltex AND eIF3f AND interaction AND protein,"41187380,41187379,41187377,41187371,41187369,41187365,41187361,41187334,41187332,41187330","[PMID: 41187380] Mutations of the Ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene are generally associated with syndromic tooth agenesis, yet their influence on non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) has not been thoroughly elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of NSTA and to identify pathogenic EDA mutations in two Chinese families using whole-exome sequencing, and explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Two unrelated individuals with NSTA and their families were enrolled in this study, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Whole-exome sequencing was performed, followed by variants detection and filtering to identify pathogenic genes and mutations. The identified genetic mutations were further validated by Sanger sequencing and confirmed to be absent in 300 unrelated healthy individuals. Conservation analysis, three-dimensional (3D) modeling, and electrostatic potential calculations were conducted accordingly. We identified a novel mutation c.827 G>T (p.Arg276Leu) and a previously reported mutation c.1069 C>T (p.Arg357Trp) in the EDA gene, with the latter showing previously unreported phenotypic characteristics. Both mutations are located in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) domain of EDA, which is crucial for binding with ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR). Conservation analysis indicated that these mutations are evolutionarily conserved across various species. In silico predictions and 3D modeling analyses suggested that these mutations may be pathogenic, potentially due to alterations in the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic potential, thereby affecting EDA-EDAR interaction. Our findings broaden the mutation spectrum of EDA gene associated with NSTA by identifying a novel mutation and provide a basis for future genetic counseling.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187377] Foodborne contaminants, such as mycotoxins and microplastics, pose significant threats to human health due to their high toxicity and persistence in the food chain, thus necessitate effective mitigation strategies. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), characterized by high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, safety, and environmental friendliness, offer a promising solution for adsorbing these pollutants. This review systematically explores the roles, binding locations, interaction forces, and molecular mechanisms underlying LAB-contaminant interactions, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetic properties of the adsorption processes. Notably, LAB strains with outstanding adsorption capabilities are spotlighted, along with innovative enhancement strategies: optimized culture conditions, co-culture systems, nanoparticle functionalization, immobilized cells, and combinations with bio-adsorbents. The review further demonstrates the applications of LAB in ensuring safe food production and maintaining biological health. Future directions include multi-omics-driven gene discovery, genetic engineering techniques for precision regulation, and machine learning for adsorption optimization, advancing mechanistic insights and interdisciplinary solution.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187369] Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with limited and often toxic treatment options. This study explores the antileishmanial potential of N-substituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridine derivatives through combined in vitro and in silico approaches. Initially, N-Boc-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine (2a-i) and N-Boc-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine (1a-f) derivatives were synthesized and evaluated against Leishmania amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. infantum, and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Only N-Boc-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine derivatives with substituted nitrogen at position 6 (2b, 2c, 2f, 2g) were active (IC₅₀ < 10 μM). Based on this, a series of N-benzyl-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine analogs (3a-i) was synthesized, with compounds 3c, 3f, and 3g showing improved antipromastigote activity and selectivity índices (SI). Notably, compound 3f demonstrated potent amastigote activities (IC₅₀ between 0.83 and 1.13 μM), comparable to amphotericin B, but with a 250-fold higher SI and low in vivo toxicity (LD₅₀ = 2000 mg/kg in Zophobas morio). Physicochemical and pharmacokinetic predictions using SwissADME and Osiris indicated favorable drug-like properties and oral bioavailability for 3f. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed strong binding affinities to Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase (NDK) (PDB: 5GO1), Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) (PDB: 4WZH), and Sterol 14α-Demethylase (CYP51) (PDB: 3L4D), surpassing reference ligands, with stable complexes, key catalytic site interactions, low RMSD, compact Radius of gyration, and reduced RMSF, supporting their potential as conformationally stable and specific enzyme inhibitors for leishmaniasis treatment. Altogether, these findings strongly highlight the potential of N-substituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridine as promising scaffolds for antileishmanial drug development and highlight compound 3f as a lead candidate for further optimization.

[PMID: 41187365] Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) as one of the most important fields of chemometrics provides useful information in pharmaceutical chemistry, drug design, toxicology, and other related areas. In this study, a QSAR model was developed employing image pixels of molecular structure as descriptors to describe the antibacterial activity of pleuromutilin derivatives. Accordingly, a dataset of 54 Pleuromutilin derivatives was collected from the literature, plotted, and transformed into pixels using MATLAB software to generate the desired model. The data were pre-processed through mean-centering and scaling to optimize pixel selection. The suitable descriptors were then extracted using principal component analysis (PCA) and the final model was built followed by partial least squares (PLS) multivariate calibration. The developed QSAR model was validated and novel compounds with antibacterial properties were suggested. In addition, molecular docking studies were utilized to investigate inhibitory activities of proposed new compounds against ribosomal protein (PDB ID: 3G4S). The findings showed high potential of proposed compounds to form strong interactions with key active site residues, confirming their good antibacterial activity and the validity of constructed QSAR model for drug prediction.

[PMID: 41187361] To explore the mechanism of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa on the accumulation of γ-glutamyl peptides and taste development in Jinhua ham, the influences of R. mucilaginosa on fungal community structure, functional enzyme gene expression, key enzyme activities, γ-glutamyl peptides accumulation and taste attributes were investigated during the dry-ripening. In comparison with Pichia kudriavzevii XS-5 (PK), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa XZY63-3 (RX) and no inoculation (CK), the inoculation with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa EIODSF019 (RE) showed the highest overall acceptance and richness. Metagenomics revealed that RE inoculation inhibited Aspergillus abundance, and the profile of Rhodotorula reached 45.94 % at genus level. The treatment of RE increased the gene abundance of amino acid metabolism pathways; the expression levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase gene in RE were increased by 83.27 % compared with CK, and the activities of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase increased from 214 U/g proteins of CK to 567 U/g proteins of RE. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the total contents of γ-glutamyl peptides increased from 136.40 μg/g of CK to 518.18 μg/g of RE. Partial least squares regression and correlation analysis indicated that γ-Glu-Cys and γ-Glu-Gln were mainly responsible for the improvement of overall acceptance and richness of Jinhua ham with RE inoculation.

[PMID: 41187334] Hexokinase domain containing protein 1 (HKDC1) is a recently discovered fifth human hexokinase isozyme that is significantly upregulated in several disease states, including lung and liver cancers. Cellular studies suggest that HKDC1 is a low activity hexokinase; however, its functional characteristics have remained enigmatic. Here, we describe the kinetic and regulatory features of recombinant human HKDC1, demonstrating it to be a robust hexokinase (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub> = 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) with a unique glucose <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value (0.49 ± 0.07 mM) that differs markedly from all other human hexokinase isozymes. The isolated C-terminal domain of HKDC1 displays kinetic characteristics nearly identical to the full-length enzyme, whereas the N-terminal domain is inactive. Unlike all other 100 kDa vertebrate hexokinases characterized to date, HKDC1 is insensitive to product inhibition by physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate, with apparent inhibition constants above 1 mM. The hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is also insensitive to Dinaciclib, a pan cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that reportedly disrupts the ability of nuclear localized HKDC1 to phosphorylate retinoblastoma-binding protein 5. Conversely, the hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is potently inhibited by a synthetic glucosamine derivative previously developed for hexokinase 1 and 2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 103 ± 6 nM. An HKDC1 variant associated with retinitis pigmentosa, T58M, displays a modest, but statistically significant 2-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub>) compared to the wild-type enzyme. Together, our results provide a detailed functional characterization of recombinant HKDC1 and set the stage for investigating the link between HKDC1 catalysis and human disease.

[PMID: 41187332] The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) compared with anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and its impact on the primary prevention of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Patients with non-valvular AF and high thromboembolic risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc > 2 points) were included. LAAO was compared against the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 11, 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-E, while statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.4.1. A total of 10 studies with 5,779 patients were analyzed (2,916 with LAAO and 2,863 with anticoagulation). LAAO reduced, though without statistical significance, the incidence of ischemic stroke (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09). However, it showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the overall anticoagulant group (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.80; p = 0.0004). LAAO emerges as a viable strategy to reduce mortality in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, particularly when long-term anticoagulation is not feasible. Its superiority over DOACs and comparable profile to VKAs, along with the absence of periodic INR monitoring and relevant drug interactions, make it an option that may optimize adherence and quality of life.

[PMID: 41187330] Oral health is essential for children's overall well-being, yet dental caries remain a significant global health issue. Gamification has gained attention as an innovative approach to improving children's oral health by enhancing engagement and promoting behavior change. Although previous studies have examined different aspects of gamification in pediatric oral health, no review has addressed it as a comprehensive framework encompassing education, behavior change, engagement, and digital platforms. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in pediatric oral health management, focusing on game design elements; intervention platforms; and outcomes such as oral hygiene knowledge, behavior, and engagement. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO), identifying studies from January 1, 2014, to February 9, 2025. The review included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and qualitative studies with measurable outcomes that focused on gamified interventions for children's oral health. A standardized form was used to collect study details, interventions, demographics, outcomes, and risk of bias. Data synthesis was conducted using a narrative approach due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. The synthesis focused on identifying common themes, evaluating intervention effectiveness, and highlighting methodological strengths and limitations. In total, 41 studies were reviewed, and most (n=24, 59%) used digital interventions such as mobile apps, serious games, and augmented reality. Game elements such as rewards, progress tracking, and interactive feedback were commonly used to enhance user engagement and improve health outcomes. The effect of the digital-based interventions was generally positive, with 38% (9/24) of the studies reporting improvements in oral health knowledge and behaviors. In nonexperimental studies, gamified interventions demonstrated substantial improvements in parental engagement and awareness of oral health practices, which translated into better brushing habits and increased preventive dental visits. Digital-based interventions were more effective in fostering long-term behavior change compared to nondigital alternatives. Engagement metrics revealed higher participation rates in gamified interventions, with improved adherence to oral hygiene routines. However, most studies (39/41, 95%) exhibited moderate risk of bias, including self-reported data and potential selection biases. This review synthesized findings from 41 studies on gamification in children's oral health. Gamification, particularly mobile apps and augmented reality, has potential to significantly enhance pediatric oral health management by increasing engagement, improving oral hygiene behaviors, and promoting sustained health behavior change. Future research should explore the long-term effects of these interventions, develop culturally adaptive tools, and integrate gamification with existing public health programs to maximize their impact.

Depletion of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection decreases dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium from the gut.,Th17 cells AND SIV infection AND Salmonella Typhimurium AND gut dissemination,"20543591,18376406,41187080,41186155,41185563,41185363,41185294,41184436,41183489,41183066","[PMID: 20543591] We discuss studies on a subset of CD4T cells, designated Th17, and their role in the pathogenesis of human and simian acquired immune deficiency, caused by infection with HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), respectively. Most of the Th17 cells are lost within 2 weeks from infection at mucosal sites of SIV-infected macaques and are not replenished over time. Comparison of simian pathogenic and nonpathogenic models of SIV infection suggests that Th17 cells contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS. Th17 cells, a recently identified subset of T helper cells, play a major role in both inducing autoimmune disorders and fencing off extracellular pathogens. Several groups have reported that the number of Th17 cells is decreased in the gut of HIV-infected and SIV-infected hosts. The loss of Th17 cells from the mucosal compartment has been associated with the dissemination of Salmonella typhimurium that is normally contained locally by the host immune system. It is believed that microbial translocation sustains immune activation in HIV infection and contributes to AIDS. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to disruption of mucosal integrity, viral spread, and chronic immune activation is of crucial importance for the design of efficient vaccines and therapeutic intervention for HIV.

[PMID: 18376406] Salmonella typhimurium causes a localized enteric infection in immunocompetent individuals, whereas HIV-infected individuals develop a life-threatening bacteremia. Here we show that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in depletion of T helper type 17 (TH17) cells in the ileal mucosa of rhesus macaques, thereby impairing mucosal barrier functions to S. typhimurium dissemination. In SIV-negative macaques, the gene expression profile induced by S. typhimurium in ligated ileal loops was dominated by TH17 responses, including the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-22. TH17 cells were markedly depleted in SIV-infected rhesus macaques, resulting in blunted TH17 responses to S. typhimurium infection and increased bacterial dissemination. IL-17 receptor-deficient mice showed increased systemic dissemination of S. typhimurium from the gut, suggesting that IL-17 deficiency causes defects in mucosal barrier function. We conclude that SIV infection impairs the IL-17 axis, an arm of the mucosal immune response preventing systemic microbial dissemination from the gastrointestinal tract.

[PMID: 41187080] Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP) plays a critical role in host defense against invading pathogens, including <i><i>Listeria</i> monocytogenes (<i>Listeria. monocytogenes</i>)</i>, <i><i>Salmonella typhimurium (<i>S. typhimurium</i>)</i></i>, and <i>Francisella novicida (<i>F. novicida</i>)</i>. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms controlling LAP remain poorly understood. Here, we identify enkurin domain-containing protein 1 (ENKD1) as a key negative regulator of LAP during infection with these pathogens. Macrophages infected with <i><i>L.</i> monocytogenes</i> (10403S), <i>S. typhimurium</i> (ATCC14028), or <i>F. novicida</i> (U112) exhibit significant ENKD1 downregulation. ENKD1-deficient macrophages display enhanced antibacterial activity, characterized by increased LAP, higher reactive oxygen species production, enhanced LC3 lipidation on phagosomes, and improved phagosome-lysosome fusion. In vivo, ENKD1<i>-</i>deficient mice <i>ex</i>hibited improved bacterial clearance in the liver and spleen, with notable survival benefits. Mechanistically, ENKD1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), which mediates degradation of Run domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein (RUBCN) through K48-linked polyubiquitination, thereby dampening RUBCN's role in LAP. Our findings reveal an ENKD1-TRIM21-RUBCN axis that suppresses LAP, providing insights into antibacterial immune regulation and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to enhance host defense against intracellular pathogens.

[PMID: 41186155] Molecular chaperones play a critical role in proteostasis by aiding the folding of newly synthesized proteins and the refolding of misfolded proteins. Cells must match the protein synthesis rate to the protein folding capacity to avoid the accumulation of unfolded proteins that can form toxic aggregates. The Hsp70 chaperone DnaK binds to ribosomes and decreases protein synthesis in the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium when facing cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation, an infection-relevant stress that disrupts proteostasis. DnaK decreases protein synthesis independently of J-domain cochaperones and nucleotide exchange factor GrpE even though J-domain cochaperones and GrpE are required for DnaK's canonical role in protein folding and refolding. DnaK's activity contrasts with that exhibited by the bacteria-specific chaperone trigger factor, which associates with ribosomes and carries out cotranslational protein folding in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-abundant conditions. Under infection-relevant conditions, the master regulator of S. typhimurium virulence and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis PhoP promotes the expression of DnaK, but not of J-domain cochaperones, GrpE, or trigger factor, suggesting that the differential expression of chaperones and cochaperones furthers S. typhimurium pathogenesis. Hsp70 chaperones also associate with ribosomes in eukaryotic cells but instead promote protein synthesis, the opposite effect that DnaK binding to ribosomes has in bacteria. Thus, Hsp70 chaperone activity differs across growth conditions and among organisms.

[PMID: 41185563] Influenza A viruses (IAV) are likely candidates for pandemics. This report summarizes the results of the Swiss national program for surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs by presenting data on their genetic diversity and on transmissions to humans between 2010 and 2022. Challenges and optimization options in the program are discussed. Nasal swabs or lung tissue samples from pigs with influenza-like signs were screened by real-time RT-PCR for swine influenza virus (SIV) genomes and the human seasonal strain A(H1N1)pdm09; positive samples were subtyped for H1, N1, H3 and N2. In parallel, humans with influenza-like symptoms and recent contact with diseased pigs were asked to sample themselves with a nasal swab. Human swabs were tested for IAV, and positive swabs further subtyped to identify potential cross-species transmission between swine and humans. In the pigs, SIV was detected in 375 of 674 farm visits. H1N1 was the only subtype detected in Swiss pigs so far. The human seasonal strain A(H1N1)pdm09 (Hemagglutinin (HA) clade 1A) was detected in seven out of 375 SIV positive farm visits. Phylogenetic analyses from partial HA and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences indicate that the remaining pigs were infected with the Eurasian avian lineage (HA clade 1C), which is predominant in swine in Europe. The Swiss H1N1 strains form distinct phylogenetic clusters within HA clades 1C.2.1 and 1C.2.2 and seem to evolve comparably slowly. Infection of humans with SIV was identified in five cases. Sequence similarity analysis assigned the five viruses to the Eurasian avian lineage (C), clades 1C.2.1 and 1C.2.2. There was no evidence for sustained human-to-human transmission. Continued surveillance of influenza viruses at the swine-human interface is of major importance to enable early detection of new IAV subtypes and changes in the epidemiological situation. The authors consider the publication of data from the surveillance program to be essential in order to raise awareness of the disease among both veterinarians and the general public and to supplement existing information on circulating influenza viruses in Europe.

[PMID: 41185363] Effective air purification is crucial for controlling airborne contamination, especially in food storage environments where microbial cross-contamination can compromise food safety. Conventional filtration methods often suffer from microbial accumulation, leading to decreased efficiency and potential recontamination. This study aimed to develop a polyester-based nonwoven filter doped with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) synthesized using a green method involving banana peel extract. Two embedding methods, padding and in situ synthesis, were optimized for pH and temperature to enhance nanoparticle deposition and antimicrobial activity. The optimal conditions were determined to be pH 12 at 25 °C for in situ synthesis, achieving superior ZnO loading and photocatalytic activity under UVA irradiation. ZnO-doped filters were assembled into the UVLED module in a 512 L aerobiology chamber simulating refrigerator conditions, achieving more than 3-log reduction against aerosolized foodborne pathogens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes. Structural characterization using SEM and FT-IR confirmed uniform nanoparticle distribution and stable embedding within the polyester matrix. The developed ZnO-doped polyester filters provide robust and reusable air purification capabilities, highlighting their potential as sustainable and effective solutions for improving microbial safety in food preservation environments.

[PMID: 41185294] The bacterial contamination and failure of pasteurization are leading threats to the safety of dairy productions. Milk contains a large quantity of fat which supports bacterial growth but its influence on pasteurization efficacy and biofilm formation remains poorly understood. In this study, we first demonstrate that the inactivation of Salmonella during pasteurization is significantly less effective in whole milk compared to skim milk, with the D-value increasing from 0.60 min in skim milk to 0.67 min in whole milk (P = 0.0047). In whole milk, Salmonella biofilms form greater biomass and display a distinct architecture from biofilms in skim milk. Specifically, Salmonella in whole milk was embedded within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), while cells in skim milk biofilms were sparsely distributed. Raman spectroscopy showed that biofilms formed in whole milk possess a distinctly higher lipid content. Therefore, we hypothesized that the thermal tolerance of Salmonella in whole milk was directly linked to its physical interaction with milkfat. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed an increase from 26.1 % to 86.1 % of the fraction of Salmonella co-localizing with milkfat after 12 h of incubation in whole milk. Lipase treatment (200 units/mL) on whole milk reduced biofilm formation and improved the efficacy of thermal inactivation. Our findings demonstrate the milkfat acts as a physical scaffold, facilitating bacterial aggregation and the formation of a protective, lipid-rich biofilm matrix enhancing Salmonella survival during pasteurization. These insights should inform pasteurization strategies of high-fat dairy products to ensure food safety.

[PMID: 41184436] Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) causes approximately 155 000 deaths annually and poses significant risks to both human and animal health. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in NTS is a growing global public health threat. Using a One Health approach, this study investigated NTS in swine, poultry, and wastewater in Gauteng Province, South Africa. From May 2019 to August 2020, 507 samples were collected, including animal faeces (n = 388), hand swabs (n = 104), abattoir and farm run-off (n = 10), and hospital (n = 1) and municipal wastewater (n = 4). Whole genome sequencing of recovered isolates revealed a 2.37% (12/507) NTS prevalence, identifying four serovars: Salmonella Enteritidis sequence type (ST) 11 (n = 3), S. Infantis ST32 (n = 4), S. Irumu ST2026 (n = 2), and multidrug-resistant S. Typhimurium monophasic variant 1,4,[5],12:i:- ST34 (n = 3). The ST34 strains, detected in swine, exhibited ASSuT (ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline) resistance pattern and marked the first detection of ST34 from an animal source in Africa. The strains harboured a novel sopE-phage (AmTI) and SGI-4. Phylogenetic analysis linked these strains to human cases in South Africa and the UK, which could indicate transmission of MDR S. Typhimurium between animals and humans, underscoring the importance of enhanced AMR surveillance using a One Health approach.

[PMID: 41183489] Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium is a leading cause of foodborne outbreaks linked to chickens in the United States. To investigate the genomic landscape of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in this population, 1 048 chicken-associated S. Typhimurium genomes collected nationwide were analyzed. Overall, 84.5% of isolates carried at least one AMR determinant, and 34.3% displayed multidrug resistance (MDR). Sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance were most prevalent (1.03 and 1.01 AMR determinant per isolate, respectively). ARG co-occurrence analysis identified strong associations among tet(A), sul1, sul2, aac(3)-VIa, and aadA1, with blaCMY-2 emerging within an expanding co-resistance cluster. ARG-plasmid replicon association analysis indicated significant positive links between sul2 and tet(A) with IncC and ColRNAI. Machine learning-driven association rule mining demonstrated that integron carriage perfectly predicted MDR, and their absence in both non-AMR and AMR but non-MDR isolates underscores their pivotal role as the defining marker of MDR. We observed a pan-genome pattern with 3 855 core and 9 549 accessory genes, reflecting both genomic conservation and diversity. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis revealed two major clades, with sequence type 19 comprising 99.0% of the isolates. This research provides a comprehensive genomic characterization of chicken-associated S. Typhimurium in the United States, highlighting key AMR mechanisms relevant for food safety and public health.

[PMID: 41183066] The bactericidal lectin RegIIIβ secreted by intestinal epithelial cells, kills the microbiota and enteropathogens but also been suggested to modulate bacterial physiology and host interactions. However, it remains to be determined whether RegIIIβ plays roles beyond its bactericidal effects. The present study revealed that RegIIIβ binds to the enteropathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in the gut, thereby increasing the locomotion speed of this bacterium through maintenance of the membrane potential. This led to enhanced invasion by S. Typhimurium into epithelial cells. Finally, RegIIIβ facilitated the gut colonization levels of S. Typhimurium and enteropathy in the early stages of gastrointestinal infection. In conclusion, S. Typhimurium has become tolerant to RegIIIβ in the evolutionary process, during which the pathogen has simultaneously acquired the ability to exploit this antimicrobial to enhance flagellar-based locomotion for successful gastrointestinal infection. Our findings provide novel insight into the roles of RegIIIβ in gastrointestinal infection caused by S. Typhimurium.",10
Diabetes remission occurs more in people treated with conventional therapy than in people treated with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery.,diabetes remission AND conventional therapy AND laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding AND bariatric surgery,"20059345,19726018,19171726,18212316,16249543,41187196,41187181,41187097,41187072,41187067","[PMID: 20059345] Several gastrointestinal (GI) operations that were designed to promote weight loss can powerfully ameliorate type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although T2DM is traditionally viewed as a chronic, relentless disease in which delay of end-organ complications is the major treatment goal, GI surgery offers a novel endpoint: complete disease remission. Ample data confirm the excellent safety and efficacy of conventional bariatric operations-especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding-to treat T2DM in severely obese patients. Use of experimental procedures as well as conventional bariatric operations is increasingly being explored in less obese diabetic patients, with generally favorable results, although further assessment of risk:benefit profiles is needed. Mounting evidence indicates that certain operations involving intestinal diversions improve glucose homeostasis through varied mechanisms beyond reduced food intake and body weight, for example by modulating gut hormones. Research to elucidate such mechanisms should facilitate the design of novel pharmacotherapeutics and dedicated antidiabetes GI manipulations. Here we review evidence regarding the use and study of GI surgery to treat T2DM, focusing on available published reports as well as results from the Diabetes Surgery Summit (DSS) in Rome and the World Congress on Interventional Therapies for T2DM in New York City.

[PMID: 19726018] To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for obesity. Seventeen electronic databases were searched [MEDLINE; EMBASE; PreMedline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; The Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Systematic Reviews Database, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, DARE, NHS EED and HTA databases; Web of Knowledge Science Citation Index (SCI); Web of Knowledge ISI Proceedings; PsycInfo; CRD databases; BIOSIS; and databases listing ongoing clinical trials] from inception to August 2008. Bibliographies of related papers were assessed and experts were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished references. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were applied to the full text using a standard form. Interventions investigated were open and laparoscopic bariatric surgical procedures in widespread current use compared with one another and with non-surgical interventions. Population comprised adult patients with body mass index (BMI) > or = 30 and young obese people. Main outcomes were at least one of the following after at least 12 months follow-up: measures of weight change; quality of life (QoL); perioperative and postoperative mortality and morbidity; change in obesity-related comorbidities; cost-effectiveness. Studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review for comparisons of Surgery versus Surgery were RCTs. For comparisons of Surgery versus Non-surgical procedures eligible studies were RCTs, controlled clinical trials and prospective cohort studies (with a control cohort). Studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review of cost-effectiveness were full cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-utility analyses, cost-benefit analyses and cost-consequence analyses. One reviewer performed data extraction, which was checked by two reviewers independently. Two reviewers independently applied quality assessment criteria and differences in opinion were resolved at each stage. Studies were synthesised through a narrative review with full tabulation of the results of all included studies. In the economic model the analysis was developed for three patient populations, those with BMI > or = 40; BMI > or = 30 and < 40 with Type 2 diabetes at baseline; and BMI > or = 30 and < 35. Models were applied with assumptions on costs and comorbidity. A total of 5386 references were identified of which 26 were included in the clinical effectiveness review: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies compared surgery with non-surgical interventions and 20 RCTs compared different surgical procedures. Bariatric surgery was a more effective intervention for weight loss than non-surgical options. In one large cohort study weight loss was still apparent 10 years after surgery, whereas patients receiving conventional treatment had gained weight. Some measures of QoL improved after surgery, but not others. After surgery statistically fewer people had metabolic syndrome and there was higher remission of Type 2 diabetes than in non-surgical groups. In one large cohort study the incidence of three out of six comorbidities assessed 10 years after surgery was significantly reduced compared with conventional therapy. Gastric bypass (GBP) was more effective for weight loss than vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and adjustable gastric banding (AGB). Laparoscopic isolated sleeve gastrectomy (LISG) was more effective than AGB in one study. GBP and banded GBP led to similar weight loss and results for GBP versus LISG and VBG versus AGB were equivocal. All comparisons of open versus laparoscopic surgeries found similar weight losses in each group. Comorbidities after surgery improved in all groups, but with no significant differences between different surgical interventions. Adverse event reporting varied; mortality ranged from none to 10%. Adverse events from conventional therapy included intolerance to medication, acute cholecystitis and gastrointestinal problems. Major adverse events following surgery, some necessitating reoperation, included anastomosis leakage, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, band slippage and band erosion. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective in comparison to non-surgical treatment in the reviewed published estimates of cost-effectiveness. However, these estimates are likely to be unreliable and not generalisable because of methodological shortcomings and the modelling assumptions made. Therefore a new economic model was developed. Surgical management was more costly than non-surgical management in each of the three patient populations analysed, but gave improved outcomes. For morbid obesity, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (base case) ranged between 2000 pounds and 4000 pounds per QALY gained. They remained within the range regarded as cost-effective from an NHS decision-making perspective when assumptions for deterministic sensitivity analysis were changed. For BMI > or = 30 and 40, ICERs were 18,930 pounds at two years and 1397 pounds at 20 years, and for BMI > or = 30 and < 35, ICERs were 60,754 pounds at two years and 12,763 pounds at 20 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses produced ICERs which were generally within the range considered cost-effective, particularly at the long twenty year time horizons, although for the BMI 30-35 group some ICERs were above the acceptable range. Bariatric surgery appears to be a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for moderately to severely obese people compared with non-surgical interventions. Uncertainties remain and further research is required to provide detailed data on patient QoL; impact of surgeon experience on outcome; late complications leading to reoperation; duration of comorbidity remission; resource use. Good-quality RCTs will provide evidence on bariatric surgery for young people and for adults with class I or class II obesity. New research must report on the resolution and/or development of comorbidities such as Type 2 diabetes and hypertension so that the potential benefits of early intervention can be assessed.

[PMID: 19171726] To determine the within-trial cost-efficacy of surgical therapy relative to conventional therapy for achieving remission of recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes in class I and II obese patients. Efficacy results were derived from a 2-year randomized controlled trial. A health sector perspective was adopted, and within-trial intervention costs included gastric banding surgery, mitigation of complications, outpatient medical consultations, medical investigations, pathology, weight loss therapies, and medication. Resource use was measured based on data drawn from a trial database and patient medical records and valued based on private hospital costs and government schedules in 2006 Australian dollars (AUD). An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken. Mean 2-year intervention costs per patient were 13,400 AUD for surgical therapy and 3,400 AUD for conventional therapy, with laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) surgery accounting for 85% of the difference. Outpatient medical consultation costs were three times higher for surgical patients, whereas medication costs were 1.5 times higher for conventional patients. The cost differences were primarily in the first 6 months of the trial. Relative to conventional therapy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for surgical therapy was 16,600 AUD per case of diabetes remitted (currency exchange: 1 AUD = 0.74 USD). Surgical therapy appears to be a cost-effective option for managing type 2 diabetes in class I and II obese patients.

[PMID: 18212316] Observational studies suggest that surgically induced loss of weight may be effective therapy for type 2 diabetes. To determine if surgically induced weight loss results in better glycemic control and less need for diabetes medications than conventional approaches to weight loss and diabetes control. Unblinded randomized controlled trial conducted from December 2002 through December 2006 at the University Obesity Research Center in Australia, with general community recruitment to established treatment programs. Participants were 60 obese patients (BMI >30 and <40) with recently diagnosed (<2 years) type 2 diabetes. Conventional diabetes therapy with a focus on weight loss by lifestyle change vs laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with conventional diabetes care. Remission of type 2 diabetes (fasting glucose level <126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L] and glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] value <6.2% while taking no glycemic therapy). Secondary measures included weight and components of the metabolic syndrome. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Of the 60 patients enrolled, 55 (92%) completed the 2-year follow-up. Remission of type 2 diabetes was achieved by 22 (73%) in the surgical group and 4 (13%) in the conventional-therapy group. Relative risk of remission for the surgical group was 5.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-14.0). Surgical and conventional-therapy groups lost a mean (SD) of 20.7% (8.6%) and 1.7% (5.2%) of weight, respectively, at 2 years (P < .001). Remission of type 2 diabetes was related to weight loss (R2 = 0.46, P < .001) and lower baseline HbA1c levels (combined R2 = 0.52, P < .001). There were no serious complications in either group. Participants randomized to surgical therapy were more likely to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes through greater weight loss. These results need to be confirmed in a larger, more diverse population and have long-term efficacy assessed. actr.org Identifier: ACTRN012605000159651.

[PMID: 16249543] Lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes in obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and conventional diet (No-LAGB) in the prevention (primary intervention study; 56 vs. 29 patients) and remission (secondary intervention study; 17 vs. 20 patients) of type 2 diabetes and hypertension in grade 3 obesity in a 4-year study. The subjects (n = 122; age 48.5 +/- 1.05 years; BMI 45.7 +/- 0.67 kg/m2) underwent a diagnostic workup, including psychological and psychiatric assessments, in preparation for the LAGB procedure. Of the 122 subjects, 73 had the surgery (LAGB group). The control group (No-LAGB group) consisted of the 49 subjects who refused the surgery but agreed to be followed up; 6 of these subjects dropped out by the 2nd year of the study, so that the final number of patients was 73 and 43 in the LAGB and No-LAGB groups, respectively. All patients had a yearly visit and oral glucose tolerance test. From baseline to the end of the 4-year follow-up, BMI decreased from 45.9 +/- 0.89 at baseline to 37.7 +/- 0.71 kg/m2 in the LAGB group and remained steady in the No-LAGB group (from 45.2 +/- 1.04 to 46.5 +/- 1.37 kg/m2), with no significant differences between the primary and secondary intervention groups. In the primary intervention study, five of the No-LAGB subjects (17.2%) and none of the LAGB subjects (0.0%; P = 0.0001) progressed to type 2 diabetes; in the secondary intervention study, type 2 diabetes remitted in one No-LAGB patient (4.0%) and seven LAGB patients (45.0%; P = 0.0052). Hypertension occurred in 11 No-LAGB patients (25.6%) and 1 LAGB patient (1.4%; P = 0.0001) and remitted in 1 No-LAGB (2.3%) and 15 LAGB patients (20.5%; P = 0.0001). A study of body mass composition revealed a significant reduction of fat mass and a transitory, but not significant, decrease of fat-free mass in LAGB patients. In morbid obesity, sustained and long-lasting weight loss obtained through LAGB prevents the occurrence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and decreases the prevalence of these disorders.

[PMID: 41187196] The safety of single-port totally extraperitoneal (STEP) inguinal hernia repair compared to conventional totally extraperitoneal (CTEP) has been supported by various randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, the optimal method remains unclear because of variations in the location and length of the incision as well as different uses of the single-port device. We standardized STEP using the glove method with a straight umbilical incision that maintained the wound profile within the confines of the umbilicus for better cosmetic satisfaction and port operative pain reduction. The incision length was limited to 1-1.5 cm, extending no further than the umbilicus. The STEP is performed utilizing the glove method using Alexis of XXS size. To minimize forceps interference, the surgeon dissected the spermatic cord into two distinct phases. As the mesh was inserted within the pneumoperitoneum, it was deployed safely and securely. In addition, we present the surgical outcomes at our institution for an early career surgeon. A total of 25 unilateral inguinal hernia STEP procedures were performed between April and October 2023. The median operative time was 68 minutes, and the procedure was performed safely with no complications requiring treatment. In conclusion, STEP using the glove method with a total intraumbilical incision can be safely performed by an early career surgeon.

[PMID: 41187181] Parrot fever, caused by Chlamydia psittaci, is a zoonotic disease typically treated with tetracyclines. Omadacycline, a novel aminomethyl tetracycline, has limited reports on its efficacy in severe Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia in the literature. We present a case of a patient with severe Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia showing symptoms of chills, high fever, shock, hepatic and renal insufficiency, and acute respiratory failure with copious yellow watery sputum. Chlamydia psittaci was confirmed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Despite initial treatment with moxifloxacin and doxycycline, the patient did not improve and was subsequently discharged after receiving omadacycline. Our findings highlight the potential of mNGS for rapid diagnosis of Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia and suggest omadacycline as a potential therapeutic option for severe cases that do not respond to conventional treatment.

[PMID: 41187097] To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline. Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities. This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.

[PMID: 41187072] Inflammation is a vital response to injury or infection but can lead to diseases if chronic. Natural remedies like plant extracts present potential alternatives to synthetic drugs, offering efficacy with fewer side effects. This study explores the anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties of the aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera (AEMO) using various animal models. AEMO was evaluated in xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, wound healing, and cotton pellet granuloma models. In the carrageenan model, AEMO demonstrated significant dose-dependent reductions in paw edema (P < .001), with the 350 mg/kg dose achieving 94.4% inhibition, comparable to diclofenac. Similarly, in the cotton pellet model, AEMO significantly reduced granuloma weight at higher doses. The xylene model confirmed AEMO's efficacy, with doses of 175 mg/kg and 350 mg/kg showing reductions in ear edema comparable to diclofenac. In the wound healing model, AEMO accelerated wound closure in a dose-dependent manner, with the 60% AEMO group achieving complete healing by Day 10. Biochemical and hematological analyses showed reductions in inflammatory markers such as ALP, C-reactive protein, and WBC, supporting the anti-inflammatory potential of AEMO. These findings suggest that AEMO exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties, making it a promising natural alternative to conventional treatments like diclofenac. Further research is warranted to explore its potential clinical applications.

[PMID: 41187067] ConspectusTailored magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have emerged as powerful tools in biomedical imaging, offering enhanced sensitivity, specificity, spatial resolution, and multifunctionality. Their unique physicochemical properties also open promising avenues for therapeutic applications. Continued innovation in MNP design is critical to fully exploit advanced imaging platforms─including high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic particle imaging (MPI), and multimodal imaging systems─for early diagnosis and precision therapy. However, conventional strategies centered on tuning particle size, shape, composition, and crystallinity offer only limited control over intrinsic microscopic parameters such as magnetic moment orientation, defect structure, and electronic activity, which fundamentally govern imaging performance. This limitation has created a persistent bottleneck in the development of high-performance MNPs. Assembly driven chemical design offers a multiscale design paradigm that spans atomic, interfacial, and nanoscale levels. By inducing emergent collective behaviors not present in individual building blocks, this strategy significantly broadens the design space for optimizing MNP functionality.In this Account, we summarize our recent advances in the assembly driven chemical design of MNPs and their biomedical applications. At the atomic scale, controlled atomic rearrangements, defect engineering, and surface atom segregation are harnessed to fine-tune magnetic moment alignment, magnetic susceptibility, water exchange kinetics, and catalytic activity. At the interfacial level, the assembly of core-shell and organic-inorganic hybrid structures modulates exchange coupling interactions, enabling integrated diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. At the nanoscale, ligand-mediated MNP assembly imparts stimuli responsiveness and facilitates the integration of multimodal imaging functions. These multiscale design strategies collectively establish robust structure-activity relationships and allow precise tailoring of MNPs for specific biomedical imaging modalities and therapeutic outcomes.We then highlight key breakthroughs enabled by these MNP assemblies. In advanced magnetic imaging, they overcome longstanding limitations in sensitivity and resolution, achieving an ultralow transverse-to-longitudinal relaxivity ratio and enhanced <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>-weighted contrast under high-field MRI, as well as submillimeter spatial resolution in MPI. These performance gains extend the imaging frontier to previously undetectable targets, such as isolated tumor cells as small as ∼0.16 mm, and enable real-time molecular imaging of neuronal signaling in vivo, paving the way for early diagnosis and imaging-guided therapy of malignancies and neurological diseases. Beyond imaging, atomic-scale reconfiguration enables MNPs to structurally mimic the active site architecture of metabolic enzymes such as xanthine oxidoreductase, thereby enabling tumor-selective metabolic therapy.Together, these findings underscore the transformative potential of assembly driven MNP design in next-generation biomedical imaging and precision medicine. We conclude by outlining future directions for constructing life-inspired, multiscale ""transformative magnetic artificial molecules,"" to enable precise sensing and regulation of complex biological activities. Ultimately, assembly driven chemistry offers a robust and versatile framework for the rational development of high-performance MNPs, accelerating their clinical translation and inspiring new therapeutic innovations.",10
Diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome experience decreased short-term and long-term risk for bleeding events.,diabetic patients AND acute coronary syndrome AND bleeding risk AND scientific articles,"40869614,40317019,40268181,39915368,39907871,39650149,39466211,39444052,39102002,39038086","[PMID: 40869614] <b>Background:</b> Reduced-dose prasugrel is widely used in East Asia for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but real-world data in diverse Asian populations are limited. This study evaluated its effectiveness and safety in Taiwanese patients. <b>Methods:</b> The PROMISE-TW Registry was a multicenter, retrospective study including 1167 patients with ACS or chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) treated with reduced-dose prasugrel (20 mg loading, 3.75 mg maintenance) across 13 hospitals in Taiwan from 2018 to 2022.

[PMID: 40317019] Stress-induced hyperglycemia (SIH) is a physiological response to acute or chronic stress characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. It is prevalent in both patients with and without diabetes, particularly those with acute or critical illnesses. The development of SIH is characterized by complex interactions among catecholamines, cortisol, and inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, resulting in increased hepatic glucose production and insulin resistance. While mild to moderate SIH may provide a protective mechanism during stress, prolonged or excessive hyperglycemia can exacerbate inflammation and oxidative stress, contributing to adverse outcomes in conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cerebrovascular diseases. The stress-hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), defined as the ratio of admission glucose to estimated mean glucose (derived from glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]), has emerged as a valuable tool for quantifying stress hyperglycemia. Unlike absolute glucose levels, the SHR accounts for background hyperglycemia and provides a more accurate indicator of the relative glucose elevation associated with critical illness. Extensive research has demonstrated a U-shaped or J-shaped relationship of the SHR with disease outcomes, indicating that both low and high SHRs are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The SHR has shown significant predictive value in cardiovascular diseases (e.g., acute coronary syndrome, heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases (e.g., acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage), and infectious diseases (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia). It also plays a role in other conditions, such as acute pancreatitis and certain cancers. The ease of calculating the SHR from widely available admission glucose and HbA1c tests makes it a practical and valuable prognostic marker in clinical settings. This review examines the relationship between the SHR and critical illnesses, highlighting its mechanisms and predictive value across various diseases.

[PMID: 40268181] Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or aspirin resistance are exposed to recurrent atherothrombotic events after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Aspirin once-daily can allow the recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase activity before the next intake in these patients. Twice-daily administration provides more stable inhibition of platelet aggregation and may improve prognosis in these patients. To demonstrate the superiority of twice-daily aspirin compared to once daily in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with DM or aspirin resistance after ACS. The ANDAMAN trial is a randomized, multicenter study including patients (aged ≥18 years) with DM or with aspirin resistance defined as: (1) index event occurring under aspirin; (2) body mass index ≥27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); (3) increased waist circumference (≥88 cm for women or ≥ 102 cm for men). The patients will be recruited in 39 centers after an ACS (with or without ST elevation) with at least one significant coronary stenosis and will be randomized before hospital discharge between twice-daily vs once daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg bid vs od). The primary composite endpoint will be the occurrence of MACE including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, urgent coronary revascularization or acute arterial thrombotic event during a follow-up of 18 months. To achieve a 20% reduction in the relative risk of MACE in the twice-daily aspirin group, a total of 2,574 patients will be included in the trial. The main secondary endpoint will be major bleeding (type 3-5 following BARC classification). The trial will evaluate the prognostic impact of twice-daily aspirin for ACS patients with DM or aspirin resistance and may change the way aspirin is administered to these patients.

[PMID: 39915368] In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), personalised medicine is key to the secondary prevention of ischaemic and bleeding events. To provide an extensive overview of the quality of secondary prevention and of personalised medicine, a consortium in the southeastern region of the Netherlands has created a PCI registry: the South-East Netherlands Heart Registry (Zuid-Oost Nederland Hart Registratie, ZON-HR). To visualise and improve personalised secondary prevention post-PCI, focussing on key elements such as antiplatelet treatment, cholesterol management and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. A prospective multicentre registry of all consecutive patients undergoing PCI at 4 participating PCI centres and 3 referral centres. Interventional procedures and concomitant pharmaceutical treatment are performed in accordance with the guidelines. The ZON-HR promotes risk stratification after PCI using a simplified protocol for a personalised antiplatelet strategy. Demographics, laboratory values, baseline procedural characteristics and pharmaceutical treatment data are collected. Outcomes include thromboembolic and bleeding complications and medication changes. Data are pseudonymised, and a clinical event committee will review 20% of the adverse events (randomly selected). This registry represents the entire PCI population and visualises gaps in secondary prevention. Weaknesses are the collection of outcomes and medication changes using mostly patient-reported outcomes. The ZON-HR is a comprehensive PCI registry that provides baseline and follow-up data of a large PCI cohort in the southeastern region of the Netherlands. The ZON-HR aims to improve secondary prevention after PCI and augment personalised treatment that focusses on key elements of secondary prevention.

[PMID: 39907871] Spironolactone has been reported to increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients. We aimed to validate this perspective in a population of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with high bleeding risk (PCI-HBR). We prospectively included a total of 1616 PCI-HBR patients who were treated at West China Hospital of Sichuan University from May 2022 to July 2024. These patients were divided into a spironolactone treatment group (n = 301) and a non-spironolactone treatment group (n = 1315). A propensity score matching was performed at a 1:4 ratio, and Cox regression analysis was conducted on the matched data. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to evaluate the direct correlation between spironolactone use and gastrointestinal bleeding. And the subgroup analysis is used to assess the robustness of the results. In this study, after propensity score matching, a total of 927 patients were included in the outcome analysis, with 259 in the spironolactone group and 668 in the non-spironolactone group. Throughout the follow-up period, 14 (5.4%) and 42 (6.3%) patients experienced BARC 2-5 gastrointestinal bleeding events in the spironolactone and non-spironolactone groups, respectively, while 6 (2.3%) and 24 (3.6%) patients experienced BARC 3-5 gastrointestinal bleeding. The incidence of BARC 2-5 gastrointestinal bleeding was comparable between the groups (14/259 [5.4%] vs. 42/668 [6.3%]; HR 0.88 [0.48-1.62], p = 0.689), as was the incidence of BARC 3-5 gastrointestinal bleeding (6/259 [2.3%] vs. 24/668 [3.6%]; HR 0.69 [0.28-1.68], p = 0.410). No statistically significant interactions were found between spironolactone use and clinical variables such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease concerning the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. In summary, our prospective cohort study, which used propensity score matching, represents the first comprehensive investigation of spironolactone usage in PCI-HBR patients. Our results underscore that cardiologists need not routinely consider the risk of spironolactone-induced bleeding when making decisions about its use in patients. Larger randomized trials or analyses from existing randomized trials on spironolactone are warranted to draw definitive conclusions about the potential association between spironolactone and bleeding.

[PMID: 39650149] Diabetes mellitus (DM) promotes atherosclerosis, leading to increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Diabetics represent a challenging subset of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a subset characterized by higher rates of recurrent ischemic events compared with non-diabetics. These events are caused by both patient-related accelerated atherosclerotic disease progression and worse stent-related adverse clinical outcomes translating into a higher risk for repeat revascularization. In addition, DM is paradoxically associated with an increased risk of major bleeding following PCI or an ACS. Secondary prevention therapies following PCI or an ACS in diabetic patients are therefore of paramount importance. This mini review focuses on the currently available evidence regarding short- and long-term secondary prevention treatments for diabetic patients undergoing PCI or who have experienced an ACS.

[PMID: 39466211] Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces the risk for clinical events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), compared with angiographic guidance. However, the benefits of IVUS guidance in high-risk patients with diabetes with ACS is uncertain. The aim of this prespecified stratified subgroup analysis from the IVUS-ACS randomized trial was to determine the effectiveness of IVUS-guided PCI vs angiography-guided PCI in patients with diabetes with ACS. From August 20, 2019, to October 27, 2022, 1,105 patients with diabetes with ACS were randomized, including 554 patients in the IVUS-guided group and 551 in the angiography-guided group. The primary endpoint was the rate of target vessel failure (TVF) at 1 year, defined as the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically driven target vessel revascularization. At 1-year follow-up, TVF occurred in 20 patients in the IVUS guidance group and in 46 patients in the angiographic guidance group (Kaplan-Meier rates 3.6% vs 8.3%; HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.27-0.81; P = 0.007), driven by a reduction in clinically driven target vessel revascularization (0.9% vs 3.8%; P = 0.003). IVUS-guided PCI also reduced the risk for TVF without procedural myocardial infarction (2.0% vs 6.7%; HR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.15-0.57; P < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10-0.93; P = 0.037). There were no significant differences in the rates of stent thrombosis or major bleeding between the groups. In the large-scale IVUS-ACS trial, IVUS-guided PCI improved 1-year clinical outcomes in high-risk patients with diabetes with ACS.

[PMID: 39444052] Safety of aspirin-free strategy immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes was unknown. We conducted the prespecified subgroup analysis on diabetes in the STOPDAPT-3 trial, which randomly compared prasugrel (3.75 mg/day) monotherapy (2984 patients) to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with prasugrel and aspirin (2982 patients) in patients with acute coronary syndrome or high bleeding risk. The co-primary endpoints were major bleeding events (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5) and cardiovascular events (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, definite stent thrombosis, or stroke) at 1 month. Of 5966 study patients, there were 2715 patients (45.5%) with diabetes. Patients with diabetes more often had chronic coronary syndrome, heart failure or cardiogenic shock, and comorbidities than those without. Patients with diabetes compared to those without had higher incidences of major bleeding and cardiovascular events. Regardless of diabetes, the effect of no-aspirin relative to DAPT was not different for the co-primary bleeding (diabetes: 5.05% vs. 5.47%; HR, 0.92; 95%CI, 0.66-1.28 and non-diabetes: 3.99% vs. 4.07%; HR, 0.98; 95%CI, 0.69-1.38; P for interaction = 0.81) and cardiovascular (diabetes: 5.54% vs. 5.15%; HR, 1.08; 95%CI, 0.78-1.49 and non-diabetes: 2.95% vs. 2.47%; HR, 1.20; 95%CI, 0.79-1.82; P for interaction = 0.70) endpoints. The incidences of subacute definite or probable stent thrombosis and any coronary revascularization were higher in the no-aspirin group than in the DAPT group regardless of diabetes. The effects of an aspirin-free prasugrel monotherapy (3.75 mg/day) relative to DAPT for major bleeding and cardiovascular events were not different regardless of diabetes.

[PMID: 39102002] Evidence supporting pre-hospital heparin administration in patients with suspected non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) is lacking. We aim to evaluate if pre-hospital heparin administration by emergency medical service improves clinical outcome in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS. Patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) presenting to the emergency department were prospectively enrolled from 2013 to 2021, excluding those with ST segment elevation MI. Patients with and without prehospital heparin administration were compared using propensity score matching. To assess the association between pre-hospital heparin loading, 30-day and 1-year mortality, Kaplan-Meier estimations and Cox regression models were used. Among 1,234 patients, median age was 69 years, 755 (61.2%) were male, 867 (70.5%) with known hypertension, 177 (14.4%) had diabetes, 280 (23.1%) were current smokers, and 444 (36.0%) had a history of CAD. Compared to patients without pre-hospital heparin administration, heparin pre-treated patients were more often active smokers (26.5% vs. 20.8%). After propensity matching, 475 patients with vs. without pre-hospital heparin administration were compared, with no significant difference in 30-day mortality (no-heparin 1.3% vs. heparin 0.4%) and 1-year mortality (no-heparin 7.2% vs. heparin 5.5%, adjusted HR 0.98, CI 0.95-1.01, p = 0.22). Bleeding events occurred at a low frequency (< 2%) and did not differ between groups. In this study, pre-hospital heparin administration was not associated with improved clinical outcome in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS. These findings question pre-hospital heparin therapy in this patient population and might potentially warrant a more restricted utilization pending in-hospital risk assessment.

[PMID: 39038086] For almost two decades, 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been the only class I recommendation on DAPT in American and European guidelines, which has resulted in 12-month durations of DAPT therapy being the most frequently implemented in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) across the globe. Twelve-month DAPT was initially grounded in the results of the CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events) trial, which, by design, studied DAPT versus no DAPT rather than the optimal DAPT duration. The average DAPT duration in this study was 9 months, not 12 months. Subsequent ACS studies, which were not designed to assess DAPT duration, rather its composition (aspirin with prasugrel or ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel) were further interpreted as supportive evidence for 12-month DAPT duration. In these studies, the median DAPT duration was 9 or 15 months for ticagrelor and prasugrel, respectively. Several subsequent studies questioned the 12-month regimen and suggested that DAPT duration should either be fewer than 12 months in patients at high bleeding risk or more than 12 months in patients at high ischemic risk who can safely tolerate the treatment. Bleeding, rather than ischemic risk assessment, has emerged as a treatment modifier for maximizing the net clinical benefit of DAPT, due to excessive bleeding and no clear benefit of prolonged treatment regimens in high bleeding risk patients. Multiple DAPT de-escalation treatment strategies, including switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel, reducing the dose of prasugrel or ticagrelor, and shortening DAPT duration while maintaining monotherapy with ticagrelor, have been consistently shown to reduce bleeding without increasing fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular or cerebral ischemic risks compared with 12-month DAPT. However, 12-month DAPT remains the only class-I DAPT recommendation for patients with ACS despite the lack of prospectively established evidence, leading to unnecessary and potentially harmful overtreatment in many patients. It is time for clinical practice and guideline recommendations to be updated to reflect the totality of the evidence regarding the optimal DAPT duration in ACS.",10
Differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells is skewed upon activation of insulin signaling.,progenitor cells AND differentiation AND myeloid cells AND insulin signaling,"41078332,39849611,38761374,36481320,36475519,35568132,35048602,35011604,34831271,34585777","[PMID: 41078332] Recent advancements in therapeutics have extended lifespan and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients, particularly with severe phenotypes. However, most patients fail to achieve normal motor function. Although structural bone defects and increased fracture susceptibility have been reported in both SMA patients and mouse models, the role of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein in bone homeostasis and therapeutic targets remains incompletely understood. To investigate the function of SMN in bone metabolism, a mild SMA mouse model and Smn1 conditional knockout mice in the myeloid lineage and mature osteoclasts were utilized. Bone architecture was assessed using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histological staining, and immunohistochemistry. RNA sequencing was performed to explore molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal defects. Primary bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were differentiated into osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively, and co-cultured to evaluate SMN-dependent regulation of osteoblast-osteoclast interactions. The therapeutic potential of exogenous osteoprotegerin (OPG) administration was further assessed. SMA mice exhibited significant bone mass reduction, characterized by impaired osteogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis. However, in vitro experiments revealed suppressed osteoclast differentiation in BMMs from SMA mice, which was inconsistent with in vivo findings. Co-culture studies demonstrated that osteoclast hyperactivity in SMA mice resulted from decreased osteoblast-derived OPG, induced by local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) deficiency. Mechanistically, SMN depletion led to IGF1 downregulation, thereby suppressing PI3K-Akt signaling, reducing OPG expression, and ultimately disrupting osteoblast-osteoclast coupling. Administration of exogenous OPG effectively mitigated osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity, indirectly promoting osteoblast function and partially restoring bone formation. These findings reveal that SMN protein loss caused IGF1 deficiency that inhibited the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, leading to downregulation of OPG expression and disrupted osteoblast-osteoclast coupling. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting OPG in SMA to alleviate skeletal complications and improve patient outcomes.

[PMID: 39849611] Orthodontic relapse, the undesired deviation of teeth from their corrected positions, remains a significant challenge in clinical orthodontics. Incomplete periodontal bone remodeling has been identified as a key factor in this process. Despite decades of research, currently there are no effective strategies to prevent relapse. We isolated and identified dental pulp stem cell-derived intracellular vesicles (DPSC-IV) from human dental pulp tissue. To investigate its effect, DPSC-IV was added to osteoblast or osteoclast differentiation medium. During the orthodontic retention period, DPSC-IV was administrated to rats by subgingival injection. Relapse distance and relapse rate were calculated to evaluate DPSC-IV's ability to prevent relapse. Additionally, Western blot analysis were used to examine DPSC-IV's inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation. DPSC-IV significantly promoted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited osteoclast differentiation. Application of DPSC-IV during retention resulted in a significant reduction in both relapse distance and relapse rate, with improved periodontal structure and decreased osteoclast activity. This effect was mediated by the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and could be reversed by the PI3K activator insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). This study highlights the potential of DPSC-IV as a novel preventive approach against orthodontic relapse, offering a novel strategy for maintaining long-term orthodontic stability.

[PMID: 38761374] Phagocytic macrophages are crucial for innate immunity and tissue homeostasis. Most tissue-resident macrophages develop from embryonic precursors that populate every organ before birth to lifelong self-renew. However, the mechanisms for versatile macrophage differentiation remain unknown. Here, we use in vivo genetic and cell biological analysis of the Drosophila larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland that produces macrophages. We show that the developmentally regulated transient activation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD)-mediated DNA strand breaks in intermediate progenitors is essential for macrophage differentiation. Insulin receptor-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling regulates the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1)/c-Jun kinase (JNK) axis to control sublethal levels of caspase activation, causing DNA strand breaks during macrophage development. Furthermore, caspase activity is also required for embryonic-origin macrophage development and efficient phagocytosis. Our study provides insights into developmental signaling and CAD-mediated DNA strand breaks associated with multifunctional and heterogeneous macrophage differentiation.

[PMID: 36481320] Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome caused by defects in the repair of DNA inter-strand crosslinks and manifests as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. FA also causes defects in mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) function, but how different FA gene mutations alter function remains understudied. We compared the growth, differentiation and transcript profile of a single MSC isolate from an asymptomatic patient with FA with a FANCG nonsense mutation who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 10 years prior to that from a representative healthy donor (HD). We show that FANCG<sup>-/-</sup> MSCs exhibit rapid onset of growth cessation, skewed bi-lineage differentiation in favor of adipogenesis and increased cellular oxidate stress consistent with an aging-like phenotype. Transcript profiling identified pathways related to cell growth, senescence, cellular stress responses and DNA replication/repair as over-represented in FANCG<sup>-/-</sup> MSC, and real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed these MSCs expressed reduced levels of transcripts implicated in cell growth (TWIST1, FGFR2v7-8) and osteogenesis (TWIST1, RUNX2) and increased levels of transcripts regulating adipogenesis (GPR116) and insulin signaling. They also expressed reduced levels of mRNAs implicated in HSC self-maintenance and homing (KITLG, HGF, GDNF, PGF, CFB, IL-1B and CSF1) and elevated levels of those implicated in myelodysplasia (IL-6, GDF15). Together, these findings demonstrate how inactivation of FANCG impacts MSC behavior, which parallels observed defects in osteogenesis, HSC depletion and leukemic blast formation seen in patients with FA.

[PMID: 36475519] The co-stimulatory CD40-CD40L dyad plays an important role in chronic inflammatory diseases associated with aging. Although CD40 is mainly expressed by immune cells, CD40 is also present on adipocytes. We aimed to delineate the role of adipocyte CD40 in the aging hematopoietic system and evaluated the effects of adipocyte CD40 deficiency on cardiometabolic diseases. Adult adipocyte CD40-deficient mice (AdiCD40KO) mice had a decrease in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (Lin-Sca+cKit+, LSK) and common lymphoid progenitors, which was associated with increased bone marrow adiposity and T-cell activation, along with elevated plasma corticosterone levels, a phenotype that became more pronounced with age. Atherosclerotic AdiCD40koApoE-/- (CD40AKO) mice also displayed changes in the LSK population, showing increased myeloid and lymphoid multipotent progenitors, and augmented corticosterone levels. Increased T-cell activation could be observed in bone marrow, spleen, and adipose tissue, while the numbers of B cells were decreased. Although atherosclerosis was reduced in CD40AKO mice, plaques contained more activated T cells and larger necrotic cores. Analysis of peripheral adipose tissue in a diet-induced model of obesity revealed that obese AdiCD40KO mice had increased T-cell activation in adipose tissue and lymphoid organs, but decreased weight gain and improved insulin sensitivity, along with increased fat oxidation. In conclusion, adipocyte CD40 plays an important role in maintaining immune cell homeostasis in bone marrow during aging and chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly of the lymphoid populations. Although adipocyte CD40 deficiency reduces atherosclerosis burden and ameliorates diet-induced obesity, the accompanying T-cell activation may eventually aggravate cardiometabolic diseases.

[PMID: 35568132] Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) belong to a group of clonal diseases of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by aberrant proliferation of mature myeloid lineages. The constitutive activation of the JAK2/STAT signaling pathway is now well established to play a central role in MPN pathogenesis; however, accumulating evidence now indicates that the IGF1R-mediated signaling pathway contributes to the maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Studies using inhibitors of IGF1-mediated signaling have reported cytotoxic effects in cellular and murine models of MPN, but no consensus has been reached regarding the potency and efficacy of inhibitors of the IGF1R-related pathway in this context. In the present study, we compared the potency and efficacy of three inhibitors of IGF1R-related pathways in a JAK2<sup>V617F</sup>-driven cellular model. These inhibitors (NT157, OSI-906, and NVP-AEW54) present antineoplastic activity with similar efficacy in Ba/F3 JAK2<sup>V617F</sup> cells, with NT157 showing the greatest potency. Both the induction of apoptosis and reduction in cell proliferation were associated with the observed reduction in cell viability. Downregulation of JAK2/STAT signaling was an advantageous off-target effect of all three inhibitors. These preclinical studies reinforce the potential of the IGF1R-related pathway as a therapeutic target in MPN.

[PMID: 35048602] To study the role of M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-exo) in osteogenic differentiation and Hedgehog signaling pathway of mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) under <i>in vitro</i> high-glucose and high-insulin conditions. RAW 264.7 cells were induced toward M2 macrophage polarization and then M2-exo were extracted and identified. Immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect the internalization of M2-exo by BMSCs. BMSCs were divided into the normal control group (Control group), the high-glucose and high-insulin group (HGI group), and the HGI with M2-exo intervention group (HGI+M2e group). BMSCs in the Control group were cultured in osteogenic inductive medium with 5.5 mmol/L glucose, but no insulin or M2-exo. BMSCs in the HGI group were cultured in osteogenic inductive medium with 25 mmol/L glucose and 174 nmol/L insulin. BMSCs in the HGI+M2e group were cultured in the same medium as that of the HGI group, with the additional treatment of 6, 30, 60 μg/mL M2-exo, respectively. After osteogenic induction for 7 days and 14 days, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarin red staining were performed respectively to assess the osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs from different groups. In addition, BMSCs in the Control group, HGI group, and HGI+M2e group treated with 30 μg/mL M2-exo were examined with qPCR after osteogenic induction for 14 days and Western blot after osteogenic induction for 21 days to assess the osteogenesis and the expression of Hedgehog pathway-related genes and proteins. M2 macrophage polarization was induced successfully, with highly positive expression of CD206, the M2 polarization surface marker. The M2-exo had the typical structure of round or oval-shaped bilayered-membrane vesicles. The diameter distribution of M2-exo ranged from 50 to 125 nm (accounting for 99.14% of all M2-exo). M2-exo samples showed positive expression of exosomal markers CD9, CD63 and CD81 proteins. Immunofluorescence staining showed that M2-exo were taken up and internalized by BMSCs. After osteogenic induction for 7 days, the ALP activity of BMSCs in the HGI group was lower than that of the Control group. After interventions of 6 μg/mL, 30 μg/mL, and 60 μg/mL M2-exo, the ALP activity of the HGI+M2-exo group was significantly increased compared with that of the HGI group ( <i>P</i><0.05). After osteogenic induction for 14 days, the number of mineralized nodules in the HGI group was lower than that in the Control group, and after intervention, only the HGI+M2e group treated with 30 μg/mL M2-exo showed higher level of mineralization than that in the HGI group ( <i>P</i><0.05). qPCR analysis revealed that the expression levels of the osteogenesis-related genes, including <i>Runx</i>2, <i>Alp</i> and <i>Ocn</i>, and Hedgehog pathway-related genes, including <i>Gli</i>1, <i>Smo</i> and <i>Ptch</i>1, were downregulated in the HGI group, all being lower than those of the Control group to varying degrees, while 30 μg/mL M2-exo treatment could promote the up-regulation of these genes, showing significant difference in comparison with their expression levels in the HGI group ( <i>P</i><0.05). In addition, Western blot analysis showed that the expression of the osteogenesis-related proteins, including RUNX2 and COL1A1, and GLI1, the Hedgehog signaling pathway protein, was down-regulated in the HGI group, while the expression of COL1A1 and GLI1 was up-regulated after 30 μg/mL M2-exo treatment, showing significant difference when compared with that of the HGI group ( <i>P</i><0.05). High glucose and high insulin had inhibitory effect on the osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs. After intervention with M2-exo, the Hedgehog signaling pathway in BMSCs was activated and the osteogenic differentiation potential was enhanced, suggesting that M2-exo might have therapeutic potentials for the treatment of diabetic bone disease.

[PMID: 35011604] Low-grade chronic inflammation and reduced differentiation capacity are hallmarks of hypertrophic adipose tissue (AT) and key contributors of insulin resistance. We identified PPARGΔ5 as a dominant-negative splicing isoform overexpressed in the AT of obese/diabetic patients able to impair adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ activity in hypertrophic adipocytes. Herein, we investigate the impact of macrophage-secreted pro-inflammatory factors on <i>PPARG</i> splicing, focusing on PPARGΔ5. We report that the epididymal AT of LPS-treated mice displays increased PpargΔ5/cPparg <i>ratio</i> and reduced expression of <i>Pparg</i>-regulated genes. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory factors secreted from murine and human pro-inflammatory macrophages enhance the PPARGΔ5/cPPARG <i>ratio</i> in exposed adipogenic precursors. TNFα is identified herein as factor able to alter <i>PPARG</i> splicing-increasing PPARGΔ5/cPPARG <i>ratio</i>-through PI3K/Akt signaling and SRp40 splicing factor. In line with in vitro data, TNFA expression is higher in the SAT of obese (vs. lean) patients and positively correlates with PPARGΔ5 levels. In conclusion, our results indicate that inflammatory factors secreted by metabolically-activated macrophages are potent <i>stimuli</i> that modulate the expression and splicing of <i>PPARG</i>. The resulting imbalance between canonical and dominant negative isoforms may crucially contribute to impair PPARγ activity in hypertrophic AT, exacerbating the defective adipogenic capacity of precursor cells.

[PMID: 34831271] Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is an evolutionarily conserved and multifunctional protein that drives inflammation in disease. Gal-3's role in the central nervous system has been less studied than in the immune system. However, recent studies show it exacerbates Alzheimer's disease and is upregulated in a large variety of brain injuries, while loss of Gal-3 function can diminish symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Several novel molecular pathways for Gal-3 were recently uncovered. It is a natural ligand for TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells), TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4), and IR (insulin receptor). Gal-3 regulates a number of pathways including stimulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and modulating Wnt signalling in a context-dependent manner. Gal-3 typically acts in pathology but is now known to affect subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the healthy brain. Despite its myriad interactors, Gal-3 has surprisingly specific and important functions in regulating SVZ neurogenesis in disease. Gal-1, a similar lectin often co-expressed with Gal-3, also has profound effects on brain pathology and adult neurogenesis. Remarkably, Gal-3's carbohydrate recognition domain bears structural similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein necessary for cell entry. Gal-3 can be targeted pharmacologically and is a valid target for several diseases involving brain inflammation. The wealth of molecular pathways now known further suggest its modulation could be therapeutically useful.

[PMID: 34585777] The risk of osteoporosis is increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy has markedly improved the outcomes of RA patients but does not improve osteoporosis in some reports. This could be a combined result of disease severity and other therapeutic agents, such as glucocorticoids that accelerate osteoporosis progression. We evaluated the effects of anti-TNF therapy on osteoporosis in an animal model of RA and explored the possible mechanisms involved. Six-week-old TNF transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice with early stage erosive arthritis were treated with TNF antibody (Ab) or control immunoglobulin (IgG) weekly for 4 weeks. We found that TNF Ab completely blocked the development of erosive arthritis in TNF-Tg mice, but only slightly increased vertebral bone mass, associated with reduction in parameters of both bone resorption and formation. Similarly, TNF Ab slightly increased trabecular bone mass in tibias of 8-month-old TNF-Tg mice with advanced erosive arthritis. Interestingly, TNFα increased osteoblast differentiation from mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) containing large number of macrophages but not from pure mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). TNFα-polarized macrophages (TPMs) did not express iNos and Arginase 1, typical markers of inflammatory and resident macrophages. Interestingly, TPMs stimulated osteoblast differentiation, unlike resident and inflammatory macrophages polarized by IL-4 and interferon-λ, respectively. RNA-seq analysis indicated that TPMs produced several anabolic factors, including Jagged1 and insulin like 6 (INSL6). Importantly, inhibition of either Jagged1 or INSL6 blocked TNFα-induced osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, INSL6 Ab significantly decreased the expansion of TNF-induced MPCs in BMSCs, and anti-TNF Ab reduced INSL6 expression by macrophages in vitro and in TNF-Tg mice in vivo. We conclude that TPMs produce INSL6 to stimulate bone formation and anti-TNF Ab blocks not only enhanced bone resorption but also the anabolic effect of TPMs on bone, limiting its effect to increase bone mass in this model of RA. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).",10

This multicenter prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06263192) recruited all non-infertile women undergoing ds-IUI from June 2020 to December 2022 in three different fertility clinics in Spain and Chile. Indications for ds-IUI included severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, female partner, or single status. Clinical pregnancy rates were compared between women with AMH ≥ 1.1 and < 1.1 ng/mL. The main outcome measure was the cumulative clinical pregnancy rate after up to 4 ds-IUI cycles. A total of 458 ds-IUI cycles were performed among 245 patients, of whom 108 (44.08%) achieved clinical pregnancy within 4 cycles, 60.2% of these occurring in the first attempt and 84.2% after two attempts. We found no significant differences in AMH levels or other parameters (such as age, BMI, FSH, AFC) between women who became pregnant and those who did not. Cumulative pregnancy rates and logistic regression analysis revealed that AMH ≥ 1.1 ng/mL was not predictive of ds-IUI success. While a high positive correlation was observed between AFC and AMH (r = 0.67, p < 0.001), ROC curve analyses indicated that neither of these ovarian reserve markers accurately forecasts cumulative ds-IUI outcomes in non-infertile women. The findings of this multicenter study suggest that AMH is not a reliable predictor of pregnancy in non-infertile women undergoing ds-IUI. Even women with low AMH levels can achieve successful pregnancy outcomes, supporting the notion that diminished ovarian reserve should not restrict access to ds-IUI treatments in eligible non-infertile women.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187125] Previous reports have noted associations between infertility in women and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in later life. However, reports conflict regarding the associations between infertility and CVD risk factors. Using data from a population-based cohort of Black and White women, we examined the association between longitudinal assessments of CVD risk factors and infertility. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a prospective cohort of Black and White women who have undergone repeated assessment of CVD risk factors beginning at study baseline (1985-1986). Risk factors included cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid levels, glucose, and C-reactive protein. At approximately 40 years of age, an ancillary study assessed histories of infertility. We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link model to examine associations between infertility (dependent variable) and repeated CVD risk factors (independent variables), with adjustment for age, race, center, and education level in 1107 women. Cigarette use and higher levels of BMI, glucose, and triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) were associated with infertility after adjustment for age, race, and education. Cigarette use had the strongest associations with self-reported infertility in multivariable models (odds ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.64, 2.14). Women with infertility histories have adverse CVD risk factors across the reproductive lifespan, but cigarette use is the primary CVD risk factor for women's self-reported infertility.

[PMID: 41187103] In recent years, the incidence of male infertility has increased to approximately 10%, with a continued upward trend. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying male infertility and developing effective treatment strategies have become essential areas of focus. Mitochondria are regulated by a complex quality control system including mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy and biogenesis, which not only maintains mitochondrial structural and functional integrity, but also supports the stability of testicular tissue and the intracellular environment necessary for male fertility. Several studies have demonstrated that dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy is closely associated with a decline in male fertility. Disruptions caused by excessive external stimuli or gene mutations can impair these processes, resulting in oxidative damage, apoptosis, inflammation, and ferroptosis. These pathological changes ultimately damage testicular cells and tissues. Consequently, this review will focus on the two key mechanisms: mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Furthermore, mitochondrial biogenesis-responsible for producing new mitochondria and regulating the number of mitochondria-also plays an important role in maintaining male fertility. Related studies have shown that mitochondrial biogenesis dysfunction can trigger a cascade of pathological events that lead to testicular tissue damage. In summary, this review systematically examines the roles of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in regulating male fertility. It provides an in-depth analysis of the pathological mechanisms by which dysfunction in these processes leads to male infertility. Additionally, this review summarizes current therapeutic agents targeting mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, aiming to identify potential strategies for the clinical treatment of male infertility.

[PMID: 41186868] Intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) in sperm cells plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including motility, capacitation, and fertilization. While previous studies have shown a positive correlation between sperm pH<sub>i</sub> and fertilization success in normozoospermic patients undergoing fertility treatments, its role in non-normozoospermic individuals is unclear. This study investigates the relationship between sperm pH<sub>i</sub> and fertilization outcomes in patients undergoing assisted reproduction techniques: in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Qualitative sperm pH<sub>i</sub> evaluation was performed using time-lapse flow cytometry, and both basal pH<sub>i</sub> and pH<sub>i</sub> response capacity (delta pH<sub>i</sub>) were assessed in sperm samples from patients diagnosed with teratozoospermia, asthenoteratozoospermia, or hypoteratozoospermia. Our results revealed significant differences in pH<sub>i</sub> values among diagnostic groups and specific correlation patterns according to the ART used. In ICSI cycles, higher basal pHi values and reduced delta pH<sub>i</sub> were significantly associated with higher fertilization rates in patients with teratozoospermia, while in IVF, the correlations were more variable. These findings suggest that measuring sperm pH<sub>i</sub> could potentially serve as a valuable tool for predicting fertilization success and guiding treatment decisions during assisted reproduction techniques (ART), contributing to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying male infertility.

[PMID: 41186687] X-ray hysterosalpingography (HSG) and hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) are both commonly utilized for fallopian tube examination and can improve pregnancy. This study compared the effects of X-ray HSG and HyCoSy on pregnancy and adverse events in infertile patients. This prospective, multicenter, cohort study enrolled 96 infertile patients who received X-ray HSG (n = 64) or HyCoSy (n = 32). The clinical pregnancy rate, cumulative clinical pregnancy rate, and adverse events were evaluated in the X-ray HSG and HyCoSy cohorts. The baseline pregnancy duration was longer in the X-ray HSG cohort than in the HyCoSy cohort [median (interquartile range (IQR)]: 18.0 (12.0-25.0) months vs. 12.0 (12.0-22.0) months, P = 0.039). The clinical pregnancy rate was greater in the X-ray HSG cohort than in the HyCoSy cohort (37.5% vs. 15.6%, P = 0.028). The cumulative clinical pregnancy rate was also greater in the X-ray HSG cohort than in the HyCoSy cohort (P = 0.040). After adjustment by Cox proportional hazard regression models, examination (X-ray HSG vs. HyCoSy) (hazard ratio: 3.441, P = 0.032) was independently associated with increased clinical pregnancy in infertile patients. In terms of adverse events, although the incidence of intraoperative abdominal pain was not different between the X-ray HSG and HyCoSy cohorts (90.6% vs. 100.0%, P = 0.174), the intraoperative pain visual analog scale score was lower in the X-ray HSG cohort than in the HyCoSy cohort (median (IQR): 2.0 (1.0-6.0) vs. 4.0 (2.3-6.0), P = 0.024). No difference was found in other intraoperative or postoperative adverse events between the two cohorts (all P > 0.050). Compared with those receiving HyCoSy, infertile patients receiving X-ray HSG are more likely to become pregnant and have less intraoperative pain.

[PMID: 41186685] To compare the efficacy of ultrasound-guided alcohol sclerotherapy versus laparoscopic cystectomy for the management of ovarian endometriomas, focusing on complications, recurrence, pain relief, and healthcare costs. We conducted a multicentre, randomized clinical trial across 20 centers in Spain. A total of 167 women aged 18-40 years with ovarian endometriomas (35-100 mm) were recruited between June 2018 and June 2022. Participants were randomized to receive either ultrasound-guided aspiration with ethanol sclerotherapy or standard laparoscopic cystectomy. Complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and six months after treatment. Recurrence was defined as the reappearance of a cystic lesion at the treated site and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. The primary analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach and included 158 patients (sclerotherapy: n = 84; cystectomy: n = 74). The per-protocol analysis included 92 patients (sclerotherapy: n = 57; cystectomy: n = 37). Direct hospital costs, complication rates, recurrence, and pain relief were compared between groups. Intention-to-treat analyses show that complications were low in both groups (12%), most of which were Grade I-II, although 4.1% were Grade III in the surgery group. The cost of sclerotherapy was significantly lower (€472 vs. €2128, p < 0.001). In per-protocol analyses, the cyst recurrence or reappearance was similar between the two groups, with rates of 25.7% (9 of 35) in the surgery group and 22.8% (13 of 57) in the sclerotherapy group (p = 0.16). Pain was improved or completely resolved in 49 of 55 cases (89.1%) in the sclerotherapy group and in 21 of 32 cases (65.7%) in the laparoscopic surgery group (p = 0.05). Ultrasound-guided alcohol sclerotherapy is a safe, cost-effective alternative to laparoscopic cystectomy for the treatment of endometriomas, with comparable recurrence rates and pain relief. https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=NCT03571776 .

[PMID: 41186627] Radiation-induced damage to nucleic acid and other important cellular constituents could likely cause cancer. The present study has analyzed mutated genes with dysregulated expression signatures due to radiation. We have predicted biomarkers specific to hormone-sensitive cancers (HSCs) namely breast cancer (BC), prostate cancer (PC), ovarian cancer (OC), and endometrial cancer (EC). The study has also attempted to prospect the pathways associated with HSCs and radiation exposure through network analysis and functional enrichment analysis. An overlap of important cell cycle pathways, DNA binding, and transcription activity pathways were found in comparison with HSCs and the radiation hallmark pathways. Hub genes TNF, STAT3, CTNNB1, and MYC in BC; IL1B, CTNNB1, ESR1, and SRC in PC; CTNNB1, BRCA1, JUN, and KRAS in OC; PIK3CA, PTEN, and ESR1 in EC were found as hypoxic signatures due to radiation. Further, the expression survival analysis found MYC and STAT3 in BC, CTNNB1 in PC, JUN, and BRCA1 in OC, and ESR1 in EC were significantly dysregulated and further mutational profiling validated MYC with 18%, STAT3 with 2.6%, and all other genes with 4% mutation. Thus, these genes are proposed as radiation-sensitive diagnostic biomarkers in HSCs.

[PMID: 41186349] Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most fatal malignant tumors of the female reproductive system, and its high recurrence rate in advanced stages and drug resistance severely limit the efficacy of current treatment methods. The molecular mechanisms of drug resistance are complex and remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have attempted to enhance treatment sensitivity by co-delivering antitumor drugs with inhibitors of drug resistance-associated factors. However, these approaches often suffer from inadequate therapeutic efficacy and poor precision due to the inability to precisely control the sequential release of the two agents. To address this, this study designed and constructed a core-shell hydrogel microsphere (MSs) system with both sequential release and magnetothermal synergy functions to effectively intervene in drug-resistant OC. In this system, the shell layer is loaded with the DYRK1B inhibitor AZ191, which is released preferentially to disrupt drug-resistant signaling pathways and sensitize tumor cells. Subsequently, the core layer releases cisplatin to achieve sustained killing of tumor cells. In addition, magnetic nanoparticles embedded in the core can be heated to 42-46 °C under an alternating magnetic field, inducing thermosensitive apoptosis and enhancing cisplatin efficacy. This approach holds promise as a non-invasive alternative to traditional hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). <i>In vitro</i> drug release experiments demonstrated that AZ191 exhibited rapid release within the first three hours with a cumulative release of approximately 26%, whereas cisplatin showed minimal early release (∼5%) followed by a markedly accelerated release. <i>In vitro</i> antitumor studies confirmed that the combined chemo-hyperthermia treatment using the core-shell MSs produced the most effective inhibitory effect on drug-resistant OC cells, reducing cell viability to 21% after 48 h, significantly outperforming either chemotherapy or hyperthermia alone. This strategy enables a ""resistance-reversal first, precision-killing later"" treatment model, offering a novel and effective solution for the treatment of drug-resistant OC.

[PMID: 41185971] Evaluate the adjuvant effects of oral nutritional supplements including vitamins, coenzyme Q10, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on fertility in patients with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). We conducted a generalized explore of 9 databases established as of September 1, 2024. Mainly studing and analyzing outcomes including serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, anti Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, antral follicle count (AFC), retrieved oocytes, and clinical pregnancy rate with the methodology of a systematic review and meta-analysis. The inclusion quality of each experiment was evaluated through the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). The meta-analysis consisted of 16 studies with 2773 participants. A review of existing evidence suggested that oral nutritional supplements, including vitamins, coenzyme Q10, and DHEA, could significantly lower FSH levels (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI [-0.94, -0.40], <i>p</i> < 0.0001), rise AMH levels (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI [0.02, 0.69], <i>p</i> = 0.04), AFC counts (MD = 0.99, 95% CI [0.28, 1.69], <i>p</i> = 0.006), retrieved oocyte counts (MD = 0.88, 95% CI [0.54, 1.23], <i>p</i> < 0.0001), and clinical pregnancy rate (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = [1.35, 2.13], <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Oral nutritional supplements for more than 2 months have a better effect on lowering FSH levels, raising AMH levels, and oocyte numbers (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In addition, we found that the use of coenzyme Q10 alone was more effective than the use of DHEA alone through subgroup analysis. There was a remarkable correlation (<i>p</i> < 0.05) between the use of both nutritional supplements and the decrease of FSH, as well as the increase of AMH, AFC, and oocytes retrieved. We used sensitivity analysis to conclude that our summary results are robust. Oral nutritional supplements, including vitamins, coenzyme Q10, and DHEA may be a simple and relatively low-risk treatment option to assist in improving fertility in women with DOR.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly recognised as a common complication in this population, yet its relationship with NEC remains under-characterised. We sought to evaluate the incidence of AKI in infants with NEC and examine its association with NEC severity (using Bell staging) in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).  A retrospective 1:2 case-control study was conducted in a single tertiary NICU between October 2018 and October 2023. Forty-nine preterm infants diagnosed with NEC were matched to 100 controls based on birth weight, gestational age, and gender. AKI was defined using modified neonatal KDIGO criteria, incorporating both serum creatinine and urine output.  AKI was identified in 25 of 149 infants (16.8%), with an incidence among those with NEC of 30.6% compared to controls (10%). NEC exposure was associated with increased odds of AKI in our cohort when controlling for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), birth weight, gentamicin and ibuprofen receipt, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 3.6 (95% CI 1.3-10.2, p = 0.0129). Among NEC cases, AKI onset occurred a median of two days after diagnosis. No association was found between Bell stage and AKI incidence, albeit with a small sample size. Mortality in the NEC-AKI group was 60%, compared to 20.6% in NEC infants without AKI.  NEC is associated with increased risk of AKI in preterm infants, when controlling for birth weight, gestational age PDA, ibuprofen and gentamicin exposure. Bell stage was not associated with AKI incidence, in our cohort. These findings support the consideration of early kidney function surveillance in NEC to inform risk stratification and improve outcomes.   • NEC is a leading cause of morbidity in preterm infants, often triggering systemic inflammation and multiorgan dysfunction. AKI is common in neonates and associated with poor outcomes, but its relationship with NEC is not well defined.  What is New: •  In our cohort, NEC is associated with increased risk of AKI in preterm infants, when controlling for birth weight, gestational age, PDA, ibuprofen, and gentamicin exposure. NEC-associated AKI is linked to higher mortality. Consideration for routine surveillance for AKI in infants with NEC warrants further study.

[PMID: 40753254] Surgical intervention could improve the prognosis of infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), but it's also an independent risk factor for severe complications and death. This study aimed to establish a nomogram to predict the prognosis of infants with surgical NEC. A total of 189 infants with surgical NEC were enrolled from January 2013 to May 2024. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors. Then, a nomogram was constructed based on the risk factors. This study demonstrated that gestational age, patent ductus arteriosus, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and serum chlorine ion within 24 h before surgery, and pH within 24 h after surgery were independent risk factors to predict the prognosis of infants with surgical NEC. A nomogram was created utilizing the five predictors and showed excellent discriminative ability, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.842 [95% CI:0.772-0.912]. The concordance index for training and validation groups were 0.842 and 0.870, respectively. The present study identified five independent predictors of poor prognosis in infants with surgical NEC and used them to establish a nomogram model, helping pediatricians identify poor prognosis in surgical NEC infants early and providing important clinical reference information.

[PMID: 40702444] Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common major congenital anomalies, accounting for approximately one-third of all birth defects. They significantly contribute to morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. This study provides insights into the prevalence, characteristics, and management challenges of CHDs in The Gambia, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis, risk factor identification, and improved cardiac care infrastructure. To determine the prevalence, management strategies, and outcomes of CHDs in children at Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital from January 2020 to December 2022. This retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study reviewed medical records of pediatric patients admitted to Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital, the main referral center in The Gambia and the teaching hospital for the University of The Gambia Medical School. Patient data from January 2020 to December 2022 were analyzed. A total of 89 patients were included, with 57.3% (n = 51) females and 42.7% (n = 38) males. The median age was 1.4 years. The most common ethnic group was Mandinka, followed by Fula. Diagnosis was confirmed by using 2D trans-thoracic echocardiography, which was performed on most of the patients (84.3%) in addition to clinical features and chest X-ray. The most prevalent CHD was ventricular septal defect (VSD) (39.3%), followed by atrial septal defect (ASD) (20.2%), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (16.9%), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (10.1%) were also not uncommon. 15.7% of cases were unclassified. The most commonly associated clinical condition among these children with congenital heart disease was Down syndrome (18.0%), predominantly observed in children born to mothers aged over 35 years. This finding underscores the known association between advanced maternal age and chromosomal abnormalities. Maternal diabetes (2.2%) and osteogenesis imperfecta (2.2%) were also noted as less frequent but relevant associated risk factors, highlighting the multifactorial nature of congenital heart disease. Two (2.2%) had a positive family history of congenital heart disease. However, in 65(73%) of cases, there were no associated conditions or family history of CHD. The most frequently used medication in the treatment of these children was furosemide, and heart failure was the most common complication. Surgical interventions were rare: only 2.2% of these children underwent defect closure and 2.2% had pulmonary artery banding, while 95.5% of them did not receive any form of surgical treatment. Seventy-three (82.0%) were discharged and followed up in the clinic, while 6 (6.7%) died. VSD was the most common congenital heart disease observed in this study, with a median age at diagnosis of 1.4 years (95% Confidence Interval: within 12 to 60 months). Down syndrome with maternal age > 35 years was the most frequent associated condition, and heart failure was the leading complication and primary cause of death. While both pharmacological and surgical treatment mode were used, surgical intervention for treatment of these defects remains unavailable in The Gambia, highlighting the urgent need to develop local paediatric cardiac surgery services.

[PMID: 40451810] Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a prevalent congenital cardiac anomaly in neonates. It is characterized by substantial hemodynamic alterations owing to large shunt volumes and is referred to as hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA). hsPDA incidence is notably elevated in preterm infants, who are consequently at increased risk of severe organ complications and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of early echocardiographic parameters combined with platelet indices for predicting the persistence of hsPDA at 14 days postnatally. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 120 very-low-birth-weight infants admitted to Zhongshan People's Hospital between May 2020 and August 2023, dividing them into the hsPDA (n = 46) and non-hsPDA (n = 74) groups based on echocardiography and clinical outcomes at 14 days. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified the PDA diameter and left atrium-to-aorta ratio (LA/AO) as independent risk factors for persistent hsPDA, whereas the platelet distribution width (PDW) index emerged as a protective factor. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) values for the parameters of PDA diameter (0.7769, with a cut-off value of 2.81), LA/AO ratio (0.8964, with a cut-off value of 1.465), and PDW (0.7521, with a cut-off value of 15.58) were calculated. Meanwhile, the combination of these three parameters achieved the highest diagnostic efficiency (AUC = 0.9222). In summary, echocardiographic parameters, particularly the PDA diameter and LA/AO ratio, in conjunction with the PDW index, are effective predictors of persistent hsPDA in preterm infants. These findings offer valuable insights for the early clinical diagnosis of this condition.

[PMID: 40128776] This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and differences between neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD)-related neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and those with non-CHD-related neonatal NEC. This retrospective study included patients with CHD who met Bell's staging diagnostic criteria and were hospitalized between 2014 and 2023 in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. These patients comprised the CHD-related NEC group (CHD-NEC group). Meanwhile, the control group included randomly matched non-CHD-related NEC children (nCHD-NEC group) admitted to the neonatal department of the Second People's Hospital in Kashi Prefecture according to the 1:2 matching principle. Patients' basic information, adverse clinical events before NEC onset as well as NEC severity and treatment were recorded. The CHD-NEC group comprised 60 cases, whereas the nCHD-NEC group comprised 120 cases. Compared with the nCHD-NEC group, the CHD-NEC group had an older gestational age (38.71 [37.89, 39.67] weeks vs. 30.65 [29.68, 32.29] weeks, p < 0.001); a heavier birth weight (3.2 [2.69, 3.67] kg vs. 1.39 [1.1, 1.59] kg, p < 0.001); and higher proportions of patent ductus arteriosus (73.3% vs. 26.7%, p < 0.001), shock (81.7% vs. 36.7%, p < 0.001), and mechanical ventilation requirement (91.7% vs. 51.7%, p < 0.001). At disease onset, the CHD-NEC group had a higher vasoactive drug score (16.75 [7.26, 23.63] vs. 0 [0, 10], p < 0.001) but lower values for the proportion of infants who were small for gestational age (15% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.045), incidence of premature rupture of membranes (3.3% vs. 26.7%, p = 0.002), incidence of early onset sepsis (6.7% vs. 23.3%, p = 0.038), and incidence of late onset sepsis (46.7% vs. 70%, p = 0.036) than the nCHD-NEC group. Among children who required abdominal surgery, the CHD-NEC group tended to have more colon involvement (6.6% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.063), but no significant difference in mortality was noted between the two groups. Children with CHD-NEC and nCHD-NEC have significantly different clinical characteristics. CHD-NEC is mainly observed in full-term infants with appropriate weight for gestational age, and perioperative intestinal ischemia may be the main pathophysiology. Conversely, nCHD-NEC is mainly noted in preterm infants, possibly related to immature intestinal development and infection. Large prospective clinical research is warranted to explore the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, indicator monitoring, and treatment plan for children with NEC.

[PMID: 40098026] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) frequently occurs in preterm infants, causing significantly impaired lung function and increased mortality rates. Studies on plasma protein levels can facilitate early detection of BPD, enabling prompt intervention and a decrease in mortality. We conducted a prospective observational study involving proteomic sequencing of plasma samples from 19 preterm infants. Our analysis included principal component analysis, volcano plots, heatmap analysis, enrichment analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Infants with BPD were characterized by increased levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP), X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 6 (XRCC6), GLI pathogenesis-related 1 (GLIPR1), Golgi membrane Protein 1(GOLM1), immunoglobulin kappa variable (IGKV1-5), and immunoglobulin kappa variable 1-33 (IGKV1-33) in cord blood. Additionally, gene pathway analysis revealed a significant correlation between the pathways associated with these genes and BPD, particularly pathways involved in the immune system, innate immune system, neutrophil degranulation, prion diseases, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and the MAPK signaling. The proteins amine oxidase copper containing 3 (AOC3) and H4 clustered histone 6 (H4C6) were diagnostically significant. Additionally, H4C6 was negatively correlated with intraventricular haemorrhage and patent ductus arteriosus, and positively correlated with antenatal steroid administration. AOC3 was also positively correlated with antenatal steroid use. Our findings suggest that the development of BPD is associated with changes in the plasma proteome of preterm infants. Specifically, the levels of AOC3 and H4C6 in the bloodstream could serve as biomarkers for the early detection of BPD in preterm infants. Furthermore, we found that GOLM1, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein, XRCC6, and the contribution of neutrophil degranulation may play a crucial role in the development of therapies for BPD.

[PMID: 40055075] Identifying clinical risk factors that may forecast the development of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in very and extremely premature infants can assist clinicians in implementing early interventions to reduce long-term morbidity and mortality rates. A cohort study of enrolled preterm neonates born before the gestational age (GA) of 32 weeks was performed between May 2018 and January 2022. Clinical parameters and comorbidities were gathered retrospectively from medical records and compared among different BPD severity levels based on the diagnostic definition of the 2019 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development criteria. Random forest models were used to rank the importance of clinical variables independently for severe BPD development. A total of 134 preterm infants were enrolled and then divided into three groups based on their BPD severity. Unlike infants with no or mild BPD, the GA, birth weight, and Apgar score at 5 min were considerably lower in preterm infants with severe BPD (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of preterm infants born before GA 28 weeks revealed that only birth weight was significantly lower in those with severe BPD (P = 0.001). Furthermore, sepsis rates were significantly higher in extremely preterm infants with severe BPD (P < 0.001). Using random forest analysis, sepsis, birth weight, and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) appeared to have the highest importance for severe BPD in extremely premature infants. Lower birth weight, sepsis, and the presence of PDA all play important roles in the development of severe BPD in extremely preterm infants.

[PMID: 39948605] Persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA) has challenged neonatologists for more than 40 years. Controversies persist about the management of PDA in extremely preterm infants. PDA is associated with morbidities, but no therapeutic strategy has resulted in an improved neonatal outcome. Acetaminophen appears to be a promising alternative with possibly fewer adverse effects. The primary objective is to determine whether a prophylactic pharmacological intervention with acetaminophen may increase the survival without severe morbidity at postmenstrual age of 36 weeks. TREOCAPA phase III is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled superiority trial, two arms in a 1:1 ratio performed in 43 NICUs of 14 European countries, evaluating whether the intervention increases the survival without severe morbidity by 10%, from 50% in control arm to 60% in treatment arm, until the age of 36 postmenstrual weeks. To detect this difference, 794 patients were required using a group sequential design. Recruitment has been closed, with 803 patients enrolled. Patients eligible for inclusion are preterm infants with a gestational age between 23 and 28 weeks. In the acetaminophen group, 20 mg/kg loading dose within 12 h after birth, followed by 7.5 mg/kg quarter in die (QID) for 5 days, will be administered to the 27-28 weeks gestational age group, and 25 mg/kg loading dose then 10 mg/kg QID will be administered to the 23-26 weeks gestational age group. The severe morbidities include severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD grade 3) according to NIH consensus, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) of Bell's stage II or III, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade III-IV according to Papile classification, or cystic leukomalacia. Whatever the results, the conclusions of this study should be informative for the neonatal scientific community. The results will either confirm the benefit of treatment in increasing survival without severe morbidity, or indicate a worsening of outcomes with prophylactic acetaminophen treatment, or show no difference in the primary outcome. In the latter case, ultrasonographic assessments of ductus arteriosus status on day 7 may help explain the absence of a difference. This could indicate that acetaminophen is ineffective in promoting ductal closure or that early closure of the ductus arteriosus is inconsequential if, despite more frequent closures, there is no associated improvement in outcomes. Ethical approval of the trial has been performed in each of the 14 countries after approval, at the European level, by the Voluntary Harmonization Procedure committee on 04/07/2020. Results will be disseminated through articles in peer-reviewed journals. European Clinical Trials Database: EudraCT Number: 2019-004297-26. gov: NCT04459117, registered on July 7, 2020.

[PMID: 39840159] Background Maternal diabetes mellitus (DM) is a known risk factor for congenital heart diseases (CHDs), which are of significant concern to infants born to diabetic mothers. Compared to newborns born to non-diabetic mothers, infants born to diabetic mothers had a higher overall risk of developing congenital malformations. This association has a complex pathophysiology that includes genetic predispositions, metabolic abnormalities, and environmental factors during key stages of fetal development. By developing screening strategies for neonates born to diabetic mothers, it will be imperative to reduce preventable neonatal mortality by healthcare providers. Purpose The primary objective of this study was to explore the spectrum of congenital heart defects (infants of diabetic mothers, IDMs). Methods This exploratory study was conducted at the maternity and children's hospital in AlAhsa, Saudi Arabia, from 2022 to 2023. The study included 401 neonates delivered at our institution. Within the first seven days of life, an expert pediatric cardiologist from the same institute performed echocardiography on all patients. Results A total of 401 infants born to diabetic mothers were selected, with 293 meeting the inclusion criteria. In total, 144 (49.1%) were boys and 149 (50.9%) were girls. Nearly more than half of mothers (189, 64.5%) had gestational diabetes, while 104 (35.5%) had pre-gestational diabetes. Out of 293 infants born to diabetic mothers, 200 (68.3%) had various CHDs, while the remaining 93 (31.7%) were found to be normal after echocardiography. The most commonly reported CHD is patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (71.5%), followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (36.5%) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (11%), and only one patient has a complex congenital heart disease. Conclusion More than half of the infants born to diabetic mothers had congenital heart defects, according to the current study, which examined the various types of congenital heart diseases in neonates of diabetic mothers. It thus emphasizes the necessity of a thorough evaluation and the strong recommendation for an early diagnosis of CHD in this high-risk group. In our population, prenatal CHD screening programs need to be developed.

[PMID: 39592675] Echocardiography is the gold standard of diagnosis and evaluation of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a common condition among preterm infants that can cause hemodynamic abnormalities and increased mortality rates, but this technique requires a skilled specialist and is not always available. Meanwhile, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is also known to exhibit signs of PDA and is a routine imaging modality in neonatal intensive care units. In this study, we aim to find and objectively define CXR image features that are associated with PDA by training and visually analyzing a deep learning model. We first collected 4617 echocardiograms from neonatal intensive care unit patients and 17,448 CXR images that were taken 4 days before to 3 days after the echocardiograms were obtained. We trained a deep learning model to predict the presence of severe PDA using the CXR images, and then visualized the model using GradCAM++ to identify the regions of the CXR images important for the model's prediction. The visualization results showed that the model focused on the regions around the upper thorax, lower left heart, and lower right lung. Based on these results, we hypothesized and evaluated three radiographic features of PDA: cardiothoracic ratio, upper heart width to maximum heart width ratio, and upper heart width to thorax width ratio. We then trained an XGBoost model to predict the presence of severe PDA using these radiographic features combined with clinical features. The model achieved an AUC of 0.74, with a high specificity of 0.94. Our study suggests that the proposed radiographic features of CXR images can be used as an auxiliary tool to predict the presence of PDA in preterm infants. This can be useful for the early detection of PDA in neonatal intensive care units in cases where echocardiography is not available.",10

In this study, lungs and nasal cavities of age-matched female and male K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were collected for dissecting sex-specific differences in pathology after infection of SARS-CoV-2 614 G, Delta, or Omicron variant. Overall, Delta infection induced the most severe inflammation and pathology in nasal cavity and lung followed by the 614 G, then Omicron variant. Sex differences in host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were variant-specific. Delta-infected males showed increased pulmonary infiltration of CD163+ ""M2"" macrophages, Ly6G+ neutrophils, and NKR-P1C + NK cells during early onset of infection, and elevated lung inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-6, and IP-10 than Delta-infected females. Conversely, females had increased lung CD4 + T cell recruitment after Omicron infection and significantly elevated lung MCP-1 secretion after Delta infection than males. Lung spatial transcriptomics data revealed that Delta-infected females had enriched gene pathways related to humoral immune response and interferon signaling, while males had enriched pathways associated with extracellular matrix production, chemokine signaling, and cell chemotaxis. Taken together, this study highlights the complex infection dynamics with respect to individual SARS-CoV-2 variants and underscores the importance of sex as a confounding factor for COVID-19 pathology.

[PMID: 39381601] Primary atopic disorders (PAD) are monogenic disorders caused by pathogenic gene variants encoding proteins that are key for the maintenance of a healthy skin barrier and a well-functioning immune system. Physicians face the challenge to find single, extremely rare PAD patients/families among the millions of individuals with common allergic diseases. We describe case scenarios with signature PAD. We review the literature and deduct specific clinical red flags for PAD detection. They include a positive family history and/or signs of pathological susceptibility to infections, immunodysregulation, or syndromic disease. Results of conventional laboratory and most immunological lab studies are not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of PAD. In the past, multistep narrowing of differential diagnoses by various immunological and other laboratory tests led to testing of single genes or gene panel analyses, which was a time-consuming and often unsuccessful approach. The implementation of whole-genomic analyses in the routine diagnostics has led to a paradigm shift. Upfront genome-wide analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS) will shorten the time to diagnosis, save patients from unnecessary investigations, and reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose a rational, clinical landmark-based approach for deciding which cases pass the filter for carrying out early WGS. WGS result interpretation requires a great deal of caution regarding the causal relationship of variants in PAD phenotypes and absence of proof by adequate functional tests. In case of negative WGS results, a re-iteration attitude with re-analyses of the data (using the latest data base annotation)) may eventually lead to PAD diagnosis. PAD, like many other rare genetic diseases, will only be successfully managed, if physicians from different clinical specialties and geneticists interact regularly in multidisciplinary conferences.

[PMID: 39052740] While inflammatory and immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in peripheral blood are extensively described, responses at the upper respiratory mucosal site of initial infection are relatively poorly defined. We sought to identify mucosal cytokine/chemokine signatures that distinguished coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity categories, and relate these to disease progression and peripheral inflammation. We measured 35 cytokines and chemokines in nasal samples from 274 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Analysis considered the timing of sampling during disease, as either the early (0-5 days after symptom onset) or late (6-20 days after symptom onset) phase. Patients that survived severe COVID-19 showed interferon (IFN)-dominated mucosal immune responses (IFN-γ, CXCL10, and CXCL13) early in infection. These early mucosal responses were absent in patients who would progress to fatal disease despite equivalent SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Mucosal inflammation in later disease was dominated by interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-10, IFN-γ, and IL-12p70, which scaled with severity but did not differentiate patients who would survive or succumb to disease. Cytokines and chemokines in the mucosa showed distinctions from responses evident in the peripheral blood, particularly during fatal disease. Defective early mucosal antiviral responses anticipate fatal COVID-19 but are not associated with viral load. Early mucosal immune responses may define the trajectory of severe COVID-19.

[PMID: 38568894] The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants as a result of continued host-virus interaction and viral genome mutations. These variants have been associated with varying levels of transmissibility and disease severity. We investigated the phenotypic profiles of six SARS-CoV-2 variants (WT, D614G, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron) in Calu-3 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line. In our model demonstrated that all variants, except for Omicron, had higher efficiency in virus entry compared to the wild-type. The Delta variant had the greatest phenotypic advantage in terms of early infection kinetics and marked syncytia formation, which could facilitate cell-to-cell spreading, while the Omicron variant displayed slower replication and fewer syncytia formation. We also identified the Delta variant as the strongest inducer of inflammatory biomarkers, including pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (IP-10/CXCL10, TNF-α, and IL-6), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1RA), and growth factors (FGF-2 and VEGF-A), while these inflammatory mediators were not significantly elevated with Omicron infection. These findings are consistent with the observations that there was a generally more pronounced inflammatory response and angiogenesis activity within the lungs of COVID-19 patients as well as more severe symptoms and higher mortality rate during the Delta wave, as compared to less severe symptoms and lower mortality observed during the current Omicron wave in Thailand. Our findings suggest that early infectivity kinetics, enhanced syncytia formation, and specific inflammatory mediator production may serve as predictive indicators for the virulence potential of future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

[PMID: 37724524] We enrolled healthy subjects that received 2 to 4 injections of mRNA-based vaccination to prevent COVID-19 months to a year from the last vaccine boost, and we found numerous SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific regulatory T cell (Treg) that developed T cell memory as effector memory T cells (T<sub>EM</sub>) and central memory T cells (T<sub>CM</sub>). CD4+ CD25<sup>high</sup> Treg expressed the chemokine receptor CCR6 in a considerable percentage, suggesting T cell homing to the vascular endothelium, lung and gut epithelial cells and brain. Treg phenotype was different than peripherally-induced Treg (pTreg) that revert from pro-inflammatory T cells under repeated stimulatory conditions, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific Treg differentiated from naïve T cells in tissues where the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins were synthetized. Twenty two of 22 subjects studied responded to vaccination developing a spike-specific CD4+ T helper (Th)1 response, and 20 of 22 developing a spike-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) response. However, in vaccine recipients the expansion of spike-specific pro-inflammatory T cells was less significant than the expansion of spike-specific Treg. Effector (T<sub>EM</sub>) and central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>) Treg were numerous as early as after two vaccine doses, with no significant differences following additional vaccine boosts. In co-culture experiments under stimulatory conditions, Treg regulated naïve T cell differentiation toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype and suppressed interferon (IFN)γ production by SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + Th1 cells.

[PMID: 37304302] Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) can suppress intractable inflammation, such as that in rheumatoid arthritis, and is used for treating more than 10,000 rheumatoid arthritis patients annually in Europe. Several recent clinical trials have reported that LDRT can effectively reduce the severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other cases of viral pneumonia. However, the therapeutic mechanism of LDRT remains unelucidated. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying immunological alterations in influenza pneumonia after LDRT. Mice were irradiated to the whole lung 1 day post-infection. The changes in levels of inflammatory mediators (cytokines and chemokines) and immune cell populations in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF), lungs, and serum were examined. LDRT-treated mice displayed markedly increased survival rates and reduced lung edema and airway and vascular inflammation in the lung; however, the viral titers in the lungs were unaffected. Levels of primary inflammatory cytokines were reduced after LDRT, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) levels increased significantly on day 1 following LDRT. Levels of chemokines increased from day 3 following LDRT. Additionally, M2 macrophage polarization or recruitment was increased following LDRT. We found that LDRT-induced TGF-β reduced the levels of cytokines and polarized M2 cells and blocked immune cell infiltration, including neutrophils, in BALF. LDRT-induced early TGF-β production was shown to be a key regulator involved in broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity in virus-infected lungs. Therefore, LDRT or TGF-β may be an alternative therapy for viral pneumonia.

[PMID: 36414219] Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may present as a multi-organ disease with a hyperinflammatory and prothrombotic response (immunothrombosis) in addition to upper and lower airway involvement. Previous data showed that complement activation plays a role in immunothrombosis mainly in severe forms. The study aimed to investigate whether complement involvement is present in the early phases of the disease and can be predictive of a negative outcome. We enrolled 97 symptomatic patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 presenting to the emergency room. The patients with mild symptoms/lung involvement at CT-scan were discharged and the remaining were hospitalized. All the patients were evaluated after a 4-week follow-up and classified as mild (n. 54), moderate (n. 17) or severe COVID-19 (n. 26). Blood samples collected before starting any anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive therapy were assessed for soluble C5b-9 (sC5b-9) and C5a plasma levels by ELISA, and for the following serum mediators by ELLA: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFNγ, IFNα, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-17A, VEGFR2, BLyS. Additional routine laboratory parameters were measured (fibrin fragment D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen). Fifty age and sex-matched healthy controls were also evaluated. SC5b-9 and C5a plasma levels were significantly increased in the hospitalized patients (moderate and severe) in comparison with the non-hospitalized mild group. SC5b9 and C5a plasma levels were predictive of the disease severity evaluated one month later. IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, IL-10 and complement split products were higher in moderate/severe versus non-hospitalized mild COVID-19 patients and healthy controls but with a huge heterogeneity. SC5b-9 and C5a plasma levels correlated positively with CRP, ferritin values and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Complement can be activated in the very early phases of the disease, even in mild non-hospitalized patients. Complement activation can be observed even when pro-inflammatory cytokines are not increased, and predicts a negative outcome.

[PMID: 36106692] SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus, causing the global pandemic of respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The type I interferon (IFN) pathway is of particular importance for anti-viral defense and recent studies identified that type I IFNs drive early inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, facilitating viral entry by intranasal recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) transduction of hACE2 in wildtype (WT) and type I IFN receptor-1 deficient (Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> ) mice, to study the role of type I IFN signalling and innate immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that type I IFN signalling is essential for inducing anti-viral effector responses to SARS-CoV-2, control of virus replication, and to prevent enhanced disease. Furthermore, hACE2-Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> mice had increased gene expression of the chemokine Cxcl1 and airway infiltration of neutrophils as well as reduced and delayed production of monocyte-recruiting chemokine CCL2. hACE2-Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed altered recruitment of inflammatory myeloid cells to the lung upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a shift from Ly6C<sup>+</sup> to Ly6C<sup>-</sup> expressing cells. Together, our findings suggest that type I IFN signalling deficiency results in a dysregulated innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[PMID: 35261923] Dysregulation of antiviral immunity has been implicated in the progression of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection into severe cases of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Imbalances in the inflammatory response drive the overabundant production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The low molecular weight fraction of 5% human serum albumin commercial preparation (AMP5A) is a novel biologic drug currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of osteoarthritis and the hyperinflammatory response associated with COVID-19. This study aims to elucidate AMP5A effects following the activation of immune cells with agonists of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and/or 8, which detect ssRNA viral sequences. CXCL10 ELISAs were used to evaluate the dynamics of myeloid cells activated with CL075 and CL307, agonists of TLR7/8 and TLR7, respectively. In addition, enrichment analysis of gene sets generated by ELISA arrays was utilized to gain insight into the biologic processes underlying the identified differentially expressed cytokine profiles. Finally, relative potency (REP) was employed to confirm the involvement of mechanisms of action paramount to AMP5A activity. AMP5A inhibits the release of CXCL10 from both CL075- and CL307-activated PMA-differentiated THP-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, AMP5A suppresses a distinct set of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and CXCL10) associated with COVID-19 and pro-inflammatory NF-κB activation. REP experiments using antagonists specific for the immunomodulatory transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor, also indicate that these pathways are involved in the ability of AMP5A to inhibit CXCL10 release. Due to the biphasic course of COVID-19, therapeutic approaches that augment antiviral immunity may be more beneficial early in infection, whereas later interventions should focus on inflammation suppression. In this study, we show that AMP5A inhibits TLR 7/8 signaling in myeloid cells, resulting in a decrease in inflammatory mediators associated with hyperinflammation and autoimmunity. Furthermore, data demonstrating that AMP5A activates immunomodulatory transcription factors found to be protective in lung disease is provided. These findings suggest that the modes and mechanisms of action of AMP5A are well suited to treat conditions involving dysregulated TLR 7/8 activation.

[PMID: 35062301] Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infection brings a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes, from a mild cold to severe bronchiolitis or even acute interstitial pneumonia. Among the known factors influencing this clinical diversity, genetic background has often been mentioned. In parallel, recent evidence has also pointed out that an early infectious experience affects heterologous infections severity. Here, we analyzed the importance of these two host-related factors in shaping the immune response in pneumoviral disease. We show that a prior gammaherpesvirus infection improves, in a genetic background-dependent manner, the immune system response against a subsequent lethal dose of pneumovirus primary infection notably by inducing a systematic expansion of the CD8<sup>+</sup> bystander cell pool and by modifying the resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) phenotype to induce immediate cyto/chemokinic responses upon pneumovirus exposure, thereby drastically attenuating the host inflammatory response without affecting viral replication. Moreover, we show that these AMs present similar rapid and increased production of neutrophil chemokines both in front of pneumoviral or bacterial challenge, confirming recent studies attributing a critical antibacterial role of primed AMs. These results corroborate other recent studies suggesting that the innate immunity cells are themselves capable of memory, a capacity hitherto reserved for acquired immunity.",10

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides cause-specific mortality estimates measured in counts, rates, and years of life lost (YLLs). GBD 2023 aimed to enhance our understanding of the relationship between age and cause of death by quantifying the probability of dying before age 70 years (70q0) and the mean age at death by cause and sex. This study enables comparisons of the impact of causes of death over time, offering a deeper understanding of how these causes affect global populations. GBD 2023 produced estimates for 292 causes of death disaggregated by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2023. We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric. Findings are reported as counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2023 include a correction for the misclassification of deaths due to COVID-19, updates to the method used to estimate COVID-19, and updates to the CODEm modelling framework. This analysis used 55 761 data sources, including vital registration and verbal autopsy data as well as data from surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. For GBD 2023, there were 312 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 3 country-years of surveillance data, 51 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 144 country-years of other data types that were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic caused shifts in long-standing rankings of the leading causes of global deaths: it ranked as the number one age-standardised cause of death at Level 3 of the GBD cause classification hierarchy in 2021. By 2023, COVID-19 dropped to the 20th place among the leading global causes, returning the rankings of the leading two causes to those typical across the time series (ie, ischaemic heart disease and stroke). While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause. Compared to 1990, there has been a considerable reduction in total YLLs in many vaccine-preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. In addition, this study quantified the mean age at death for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and found noticeable variation by sex and location. The global all-cause mean age at death increased from 46·8 years (95% UI 46·6-47·0) in 1990 to 63·4 years (63·1-63·7) in 2023. For males, mean age increased from 45·4 years (45·1-45·7) to 61·2 years (60·7-61·6), and for females it increased from 48·5 years (48·1-48·8) to 65·9 years (65·5-66·3), from 1990 to 2023. The highest all-cause mean age at death in 2023 was found in the high-income super-region, where the mean age for females reached 80·9 years (80·9-81·0) and for males 74·8 years (74·8-74·9). By comparison, the lowest all-cause mean age at death occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was 38·0 years (37·5-38·4) for females and 35·6 years (35·2-35·9) for males in 2023. Lastly, our study found that all-cause 70q0 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, although with large variability between them. For females, we found that 70q0 notably increased from drug use disorders and conflict and terrorism. Leading causes that increased 70q0 for males also included drug use disorders, as well as diabetes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there was an increase in 70q0 for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Additionally, the mean age at death from NCDs was lower than the expected mean age at death for this super-region. By comparison, there was an increase in 70q0 for drug use disorders in the high-income super-region, which also had an observed mean age at death lower than the expected value. We examined global mortality patterns over the past three decades, highlighting-with enhanced estimation methods-the impacts of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to broader trends such as increasing NCDs in low-income regions that reflect ongoing shifts in the global epidemiological transition. This study also delves into premature mortality patterns, exploring the interplay between age and causes of death and deepening our understanding of where targeted resources could be applied to further reduce preventable sources of mortality. We provide essential insights into global and regional health disparities, identifying locations in need of targeted interventions to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases. There is an ever-present need for strengthened health-care systems that are resilient to future pandemics and the shifting burden of disease, particularly among ageing populations in regions with high mortality rates. Robust estimates of causes of death are increasingly essential to inform health priorities and guide efforts toward achieving global health equity. The need for global collaboration to reduce preventable mortality is more important than ever, as shifting burdens of disease are affecting all nations, albeit at different paces and scales.

[PMID: 41092927] Comprehensive, comparable, and timely estimates of demographic metrics-including life expectancy and age-specific mortality-are essential for evaluating, understanding, and addressing trends in population health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of timely and all-cause mortality estimates for being able to respond to changing trends in health outcomes, showing a strong need for demographic analysis tools that can produce all-cause mortality estimates more rapidly with more readily available all-age vital registration (VR) data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is an ongoing research effort that quantifies human health by estimating a range of epidemiological quantities of interest across time, age, sex, location, cause, and risk. This study-part of the latest GBD release, GBD 2023-aims to provide new and updated estimates of all-cause mortality and life expectancy for 1950 to 2023 using a novel statistical model that accounts for complex correlation structures in demographic data across age and time. We used 24 025 data sources from VR, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources to estimate all-cause mortality for males, females, and all sexes combined across 25 age groups in 204 countries and territories as well as 660 subnational units in 20 countries and territories, for the years 1950-2023. For the first time, we used complete birth history data for ages 5-14 years, age-specific sibling history data for ages 15-49 years, and age-specific mortality data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. We developed a single statistical model that incorporates both parametric and non-parametric methods, referred to as OneMod, to produce estimates of all-cause mortality for each age-sex-location group. OneMod includes two main steps: a detailed regression analysis with a generalised linear modelling tool that accounts for age-specific covariate effects such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a population attributable fraction (PAF) for all risk factors combined; and a non-parametric analysis of residuals using a multivariate kernel regression model that smooths across age and time to adaptably follow trends in the data without overfitting. We calibrated asymptotic uncertainty estimates using Pearson residuals to produce 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) and corresponding 1000 draws. Life expectancy was calculated from age-specific mortality rates with standard demographic methods. For each measure, 95% UIs were calculated with the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. In 2023, 60·1 million (95% UI 59·0-61·1) deaths occurred globally, of which 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) were in children younger than 5 years. Due to considerable population growth and ageing since 1950, the number of annual deaths globally increased by 35·2% (32·2-38·4) over the 1950-2023 study period, during which the global age-standardised all-cause mortality rate declined by 66·6% (65·8-67·3). Trends in age-specific mortality rates between 2011 and 2023 varied by age group and location, with the largest decline in under-5 mortality occurring in east Asia (67·7% decrease); the largest increases in mortality for those aged 5-14 years, 25-29 years, and 30-39 years occurring in high-income North America (11·5%, 31·7%, and 49·9%, respectively); and the largest increases in mortality for those aged 15-19 years and 20-24 years occurring in Eastern Europe (53·9% and 40·1%, respectively). We also identified higher than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 5-14 years (87·3% higher in GBD 2023 than GBD 2021 on average across countries and territories over the 1950-2021 period) and for females aged 15-29 years (61·2% higher), as well as lower than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 50 years and older (13·2% lower), reflecting advances in our modelling approach. Global life expectancy followed three distinct trends over the study period. First, between 1950 and 2019, there were considerable improvements, from 51·2 (50·6-51·7) years for females and 47·9 (47·4-48·4) years for males in 1950 to 76·3 (76·2-76·4) years for females and 71·4 (71·3-71·5) years for males in 2019. Second, this period was followed by a decrease in life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to 74·7 (74·6-74·8) years for females and 69·3 (69·2-69·4) years for males in 2021. Finally, the world experienced a period of post-pandemic recovery in 2022 and 2023, wherein life expectancy generally returned to pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2023 (76·3 [76·0-76·6] years for females and 71·5 [71·2-71·8] years for males). 194 (95·1%) of 204 countries and territories experienced at least partial post-pandemic recovery in age-standardised mortality rates by 2023, with 61·8% (126 of 204) recovering to or falling below pre-pandemic levels. There were several mortality trajectories during and following the pandemic across countries and territories. Long-term mortality trends also varied considerably between age groups and locations, demonstrating the diverse landscape of health outcomes globally. This analysis identified several key differences in mortality trends from previous estimates, including higher rates of adolescent mortality, higher rates of young adult mortality in females, and lower rates of mortality in older age groups in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also highlight stark differences across countries and territories in the timing and scale of changes in all-cause mortality trends during and following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-23). Our estimates of evolving trends in mortality and life expectancy across locations, ages, sexes, and SDI levels in recent years as well as over the entire 1950-2023 study period provide crucial information for governments, policy makers, and the public to ensure that health-care systems, economies, and societies are prepared to address the world's health needs, particularly in populations with higher rates of mortality than previously known. The estimates from this study provide a robust framework for GBD and a valuable foundation for policy development, implementation, and evaluation around the world. Gates Foundation.

[PMID: 41015051] Cancer is a leading cause of death globally. Accurate cancer burden information is crucial for policy planning, but many countries do not have up-to-date cancer surveillance data. To inform global cancer-control efforts, we used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 framework to generate and analyse estimates of cancer burden for 47 cancer types or groupings by age, sex, and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023, cancer burden attributable to selected risk factors from 1990 to 2023, and forecasted cancer burden up to 2050. Cancer estimation in GBD 2023 used data from population-based cancer registration systems, vital registration systems, and verbal autopsies. Cancer mortality was estimated using ensemble models, with incidence informed by mortality estimates and mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). Prevalence estimates were generated from modelled survival estimates, then multiplied by disability weights to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the GBD standard life expectancy at the age of death. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We used the GBD 2023 comparative risk assessment framework to estimate cancer burden attributable to 44 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risk factors. To forecast cancer burden from 2024 to 2050, we used the GBD 2023 forecasting framework, which included forecasts of relevant risk factor exposures and used Socio-demographic Index as a covariate for forecasting the proportion of each cancer not affected by these risk factors. Progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4 aim to reduce non-communicable disease mortality by a third between 2015 and 2030 was estimated for cancer. In 2023, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, there were 18·5 million (95% uncertainty interval 16·4 to 20·7) incident cases of cancer and 10·4 million (9·65 to 10·9) deaths, contributing to 271 million (255 to 285) DALYs globally. Of these, 57·9% (56·1 to 59·8) of incident cases and 65·8% (64·3 to 67·6) of cancer deaths occurred in low-income to upper-middle-income countries based on World Bank income group classifications. Cancer was the second leading cause of deaths globally in 2023 after cardiovascular diseases. There were 4·33 million (3·85 to 4·78) risk-attributable cancer deaths globally in 2023, comprising 41·7% (37·8 to 45·4) of all cancer deaths. Risk-attributable cancer deaths increased by 72·3% (57·1 to 86·8) from 1990 to 2023, whereas overall global cancer deaths increased by 74·3% (62·2 to 86·2) over the same period. The reference forecasts (the most likely future) estimate that in 2050 there will be 30·5 million (22·9 to 38·9) cases and 18·6 million (15·6 to 21·5) deaths from cancer globally, 60·7% (41·9 to 80·6) and 74·5% (50·1 to 104·2) increases from 2024, respectively. These forecasted increases in deaths are greater in low-income and middle-income countries (90·6% [61·0 to 127·0]) compared with high-income countries (42·8% [28·3 to 58·6]). Most of these increases are likely due to demographic changes, as age-standardised death rates are forecast to change by -5·6% (-12·8 to 4·6) between 2024 and 2050 globally. Between 2015 and 2030, the probability of dying due to cancer between the ages of 30 years and 70 years was forecasted to have a relative decrease of 6·5% (3·2 to 10·3). Cancer is a major contributor to global disease burden, with increasing numbers of cases and deaths forecasted up to 2050 and a disproportionate growth in burden in countries with scarce resources. The decline in age-standardised mortality rates from cancer is encouraging but insufficient to meet the SDG target set for 2030. Effectively and sustainably addressing cancer burden globally will require comprehensive national and international efforts that consider health systems and context in the development and implementation of cancer-control strategies across the continuum of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

[PMID: 40998204] Previous studies investigating the health benefits of green space primarily focused on its quantity, while individual accessibility has been insufficiently considered. This study aimed to investigate the associations between green space within accessible isochrones and mortality and the effect modification by regional urbanicity. Using a nationally representative survey of 47,086 participants with prospective death records according to ICD-10 codes (up to December 2017) and high spatial-resolution remote sensing data, this cohort study investigated the associations of green space (characterized using green land cover proportion and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]) within 15-min walking and cycling isochrones with all-cause and cause-specific (cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer) mortality. We also explored the associations across regions with different levels of urbanicity-related built environment factors using interaction models. Green space within 15-min walking and cycling isochrones was associated with lower risks of mortality. For instance, a 10 % increase in green land cover proportion within 15-min isochrones was associated with 5 % (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.95, 95 % CI: 0.90, 1.00 for walking) and 12 % (HR = 0.88, 95 % CI: 0.81, 0.96 for cycling) reductions in all-cause mortality risk. Stronger protective effects of green space on mortality were found in areas with higher nighttime light index (NLI), population density, road density, and impervious land cover proportion (P for interaction <0.05). Similar effect modification by urbanicity-related built environment factors was also found for associations of green space with cardiovascular disease mortality. Accessible green space within 15-min walking and cycling regions was associated with lower mortality risks, especially in regions with higher urbanicity levels. The findings underscore the importance of considering both the accessibility of green space and regional urbanicity in land planning to maximize the health benefits of green space.

[PMID: 40935639] The incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer remain on the rise, creating an urgent need for screening among high-risk populations and early prevention. This study aims to explore the association and interaction between multidimensional lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and the incidence of lung cancer, and to provide scientific evidence for screening high-risk populations and preventing lung cancer. Healthy lifestyle score was constructed using information on smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet and sleep obtained through a questionnaire survey. Socioeconomic status was evaluated based on information on education, employment, and family income, and genetic testing data were used to assess the risk of genetic variation. A proportional hazards assumption test was conducted, and the Cox proportional hazards model was applied to analyze the associations between healthy lifestyle scores, socioeconomic status, and lung cancer, as well as the interactions among various factors, after adjusting for the risk of genetic variation, age, gender, diabetes, hypertension and the living environment score. A total of 245,538 samples that entered the cohort from March, 2006 to October, 2010 were included and followed up until December 31, 2022. The participants were divided into the case group (n=1472) and the control group (n=244,066). The analysis results showed that after adjusting for covariates, there was still an association between the healthy lifestyle score, socioeconomic status, and the incidence of lung cancer: compared with participants with a high healthy lifestyle score, the risk of lung cancer in participants with medium and low healthy lifestyle scores was significantly increased, with hazard ratios (HR) of 2.12 (95%CI: 1.86-2.41) and 3.36 (95%CI: 2.82-3.99) respectively; compared with participants with high socioeconomic status, the risk of lung cancer in participants with medium and low socioeconomic status was significantly increased, with HR of 1.29 (95%CI: 1.13-1.48) and 1.67 (95%CI: 1.46-1.90) respectively. Moreover, there were interactions between smoking status and socioeconomic status (Pfor interaction=0.05), as well as the other four lifestyle factors (Pfor interaction=0.02). This study identified the association between multidimensional lifestyle factors and socioeconomic status with the incidence of lung cancer, as well as interactions between smoking and socioeconomic status and four other lifestyle factors, providing a scientific basis for screening and prevention in high-risk populations for lung cancer.

[PMID: 40885932] Although studies have demonstrated that both lifestyles and subjective well-being (SWB) are associated with mortality risk, the joint effects of a healthy lifestyle and SWB on the risk of mortality are unclear. This study aimed to explore the combined impact of lifestyles and SWB on total mortality among the older Chinese population. Data were obtained from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey conducted from 2002 to 2018. A total of 13,282 participants aged ≥ 65 years were included. SWB was measured by an eight-item tool covering life satisfaction, optimism, conscientiousness, anxiety, loneliness, personal control, feeling useless, and happiness. A total healthy lifestyle score was calculated by summing across five lifestyle factors (smoking, drinking, exercise, dietary diversity and body mass index), ranging from 0 to 5, and was categorized into the following groups: healthy (4-5 points), intermediate (2-3 points) and unhealthy (0-1 point). Cox proportional regression analyses were carried out adjusting for demographic characteristics and other potential confounders. In total, 8549 (64.4%) deaths were reported during the follow-up period. Compared with the higher healthy lifestyle score, the hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality for the intermediate and unhealthy lifestyle scores were 1.11 (1.04-1.17) and 1.17 (1.09-1.26), respectively, independent of SWB. A similar relationship between SWB and total mortality was observed, independent of lifestyle factors. The participants who had worse SWB experienced a 1.19 (1.14-1.25) higher risk of total mortality in comparison with those who had better SWB after adjusting for lifestyles. Combinations of unhealthy lifestyle scores and poor SWB were associated with an increased risk of total mortality, and the highest risk was found among participants with a healthy lifestyle score of 0-1 and worse SWB (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.28-1.55). A stronger risk of total mortality was found when worse SWB and unhealthy lifestyle occurred together, suggesting that a comprehensive approach to healthy lifestyle and SWB might be a potential strategy to improve longevity.

[PMID: 40613666] Frailty predicts increased cancer recurrence and mortality among older cancer survivors. Qigong has been shown to improve physical and mental well-being, as well as inflammation, which are closely linked with frailty in the cancer population. This study aims to evaluate the effect of qigong on frailty among older cancer survivors. An assessor-blind multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Post-treatment cancer survivors aged 65+ screened as pre-frail or frail based on the Fried frailty phenotype were recruited and randomised to an intervention (16-week qigong Baduanjin) or an active control group (16-week light flexibility exercise). The primary outcome was the reversal of frailty status. The secondary outcomes included physical frailty severity, multidimensional frailty severity, physical performance, psychological well-being and quality of life. Analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. Two hundred twenty-six older cancer survivors were randomised, 113 to the qigong group and 113 to the light flexibility exercise group. At 16 weeks, the difference in the rates of frailty reversal in the qigong group (28.7%) and the light flexibility exercise group (22.5%) was insignificant (adjusted odds ratio = 1.39, 95% CI, 0.65 to 2.95). While both groups had significant improvement in physical frailty severity, physical performance, psychological well-being and quality of life, only the qigong group had significant improvement in multidimensional frailty severity. The group × time interaction was not significant. Qigong was not superior to an active control in its effect on improving frailty in older cancer survivors. Researchers should include routine care as control and examine the underlying mechanisms driving the change in frailty.

[PMID: 40509832] To explore the prospective association between physical activity level and mortality risk in Chinese adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Based on the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) who had COPD at the baseline survey, this study employed the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the prospective associations between the overall physical activity, different intensities (low-level, moderate-to-vigorous-level), and types (occupational, non-occupational) of physical activity level and the risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality, such as vascular diseases, cancer, and respiratory diseases. Based on the quintiles of physical activity level, participants were divided into five groups (Q1-Q5), with the lowest quintile group (Q1) as the reference group. Hazard ratio (<i>HR</i>) and 95% confidence interval (95%<i>CI</i>) were calculated for the remaining. In our study, we also performed sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including age, gender, self-rated health status, severity of COPD, <i>etc</i>. Among 33 588 COPD patients at the baseline survey, 8 314 (22.2%) deaths were documented during an average follow-up of (11.1±3.1) years. Negative linear associations between the overall physical activity level and mortality risk from all-cause, vascular, and respiratory diseases were observed (<i>P</i> trend for linear correlation being < 0.001, 0.002, < 0.001). Compared with the lowest quintile group of total physical activity (Q1), the hazard ratios (<i>HR</i>) and 95% confidence intervals (<i>CI</i>) for all-cause mortality, vascular disease mortality, and respiratory disease mortality in the highest quintile group (Q5) were 0.77 (0.70, 0.85), 0.77 (0.65, 0.91), and 0.58 (0.48, 0.71), respectively. The low-level and moderate-to-vigorous-level physical activity were negatively associated with all-cause mortality in the COPD patients (<i>P</i> trend for linear correlation: 0.002, < 0.001, respectively). Compared with the lowest quintile group of low-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (Q1), the <i>HRs</i> (95%<i>CI</i>) for all-cause mortality in the highest quintile group (Q5) were 0.89 (0.82, 0.97) and 0.79 (0.72, 0.87), respectively. The occupational and non-occupational physical activity were also found to have a linear inverse association with all-cause mortality risk among the COPD patients (<i>P</i> trend < 0.001 and 0.015, respectively). Compared with the lowest quintile group of occupational and non-occupational physical activity (Q1), the <i>HR</i> (95%<i>CI</i>) for all-cause mortality in the highest quintile group (Q5) were 0.69 (0.61, 0.78) and 0.91 (0.84, 0.98), respectively. The associations between overall physical activity and all-cause mortality risk were stronger for patients aged 60 and above, female, and who reported poor health status (<i>P</i> for interaction: 0.028, 0.012, 0.010). The protective effect of total physical activity was also applicable to the COPD patients of varying severity. Physical activity could reduce the mortality risk in a dose-response relationship among COPD patients, regardless of its intensity and type, especially among individuals aged 60 and above, females, and those with poor self-report health status.

[PMID: 40505553] The impact of healthy lifestyles on epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and mortality in middle-aged/ senior populations remains unclear. This study investigates associations between lifestyle factors, EAA biomarkers, and mortality risk. The 2532 adults of 50 years or older that registered in NHANES between 1999-2002.This study evaluated compares first- to third-generation epigenetic clocks (HannumAge, HorvathAge, PhenoAge, GrimAge2, DunedinPoAm) in predicting mortality risk associations between five lifestyle domains (diet, abdominal adiposity, physical activity, smoking, alcohol) and EAA were analyzed via multivariable regression, with mediation models testing EAA's role in lifestyle-mortality relationships. Survival curves results identified DunedinPoAm, GrimAge2AA, and PhenoAgeAA as robust biomarkers of accelerated biological aging, independent of chronological age. In multivariable linear regression models, full adherence to healthy behaviors reduced GrimAge2AA by β = -5.55 years, PhenoAgeAA by β = -2.64 years, and DunedinPoAm by β = -0.06 SD, with smoking cessation demonstrating the strongest GrimAge2AA attenuation (10.17 years). Stratified analyses revealed pronounced benefits: cancer patients adhering to healthy diets (β = -0.04 SD, P for interaction = 0.01) and hypertensive individuals reducing smoking (β = -0.05 SD, P for interaction = 0.04) showed significant EAA mitigation. The sensitivity analysis is consistent with the original results. Mediation analyses indicated GrimAge2AA accounted for 63.58% of lifestyle-survival associations, DunedinPoAm (44.63%) and PhenoAgeAA (28.45%). These findings suggest that comprehensive adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors is associated with reduced epigenetic aging, supporting their potential utility as targets for mortality risk mitigation. And emphasize the utility of epigenetic clocks in precision gerontology.

[PMID: 39843619] Adults living with overweight or obesity do not represent a single homogenous group in terms of mortality and disease risks. The aim of our study was to evaluate how the associations of adulthood overweight and obesity with mortality and incident disease are modified by (i.e., differ according to) self-reported childhood body weight categories. The sample comprised 191,181 men and 242,806 women aged 40-69 years (in 2006-2010) in the UK Biobank. The outcomes were all-cause mortality, incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and incident obesity-related cancer. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate how the associations with the outcomes of adulthood weight status (normal weight, overweight, obesity) differed according to perceived body weight at age 10 years (about average, thinner, plumper). To triangulate results using an approach that better accounts for confounding, analyses were repeated using previously developed and validated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for childhood body weight and adulthood BMI, categorised into three-tier variables using the same proportions as in the observational variables. In both sexes, adulthood obesity was associated with higher hazards of all outcomes. However, the associations of obesity with all-cause mortality and incident CVD were stronger in adults who reported being thinner at 10 years. For example, obesity was associated with a 1.28 (1.21, 1.35) times higher hazard of all-cause mortality in men who reported being an average weight child, but among men who reported being a thinner child this estimate was 1.63 (1.53, 1.75). The ratio between these two estimates was 1.28 (1.17, 1.40). There was also some evidence that the associations of obesity with all-cause mortality and incident CVD were stronger in adults who reported being plumper at 10 years. In genetic analyses, however, there was no evidence that the association of obesity (according to the adult PRS) with mortality or incident CVD differed according to childhood body size (according to the child PRS). For incident obesity-related cancer, the evidence for effect modification was limited and inconsistent between the observational and genetic analyses.

In this paper we evaluated associations between long-term fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) exposure and incident depression and anxiety in a large, diverse cohort and investigated effect modification by race/ethnicity, insurance status, and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status. We used data from the All of Us Research Program (2018-2022) to analyze two cohorts (n > 100,000 each) to identify incident cases of depression and anxiety. We assigned annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations based on residential zip-codes and used Cox proportional hazards models with natural cubic splines to estimate associations, adjusting for individual and community-level covariates. For a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the hazard ratio (HR) was 2.14 (95 % CI: 1.41, 3.24) for anxiety and 1.66 (95 % CI: 1.02, 2.70) for depression. Comparing highest to lowest PM<sub>2.5</sub> quartile, the HR was 1.10 (95 % CI: 1.03-1.19) for anxiety and 1.45 (95 % CI: 1.33-1.57) for depression. Depression risks were elevated even at PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels below the EPA standard of 9.0 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, while anxiety risks increased only at higher concentrations. Black participants showed approximately twice the risk of both outcomes compared to other racial groups, which may reflect the cumulative impacts of systemic racism in the United States, including residential segregation, limited healthcare access, and chronic stress. Results emphasize the need for targeted interventions in communities facing multiple structural disadvantages.

[PMID: 40485934] Fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) air pollution is associated with increased internalizing symptoms (e.g. depressive and anxiety symptoms), particularly during adolescence-a critical period for the emergence of anxiety disorders and vulnerability to neurotoxicants. Preclinical studies suggest that inflammation, including cytokines, reactive proteins, and lipid mediators, may explain the link between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and psychiatric risk. However, growing evidence suggests that these relationships may differ by sex, with females potentially more vulnerable to the effects of air pollution on psychiatric symptoms, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study examined the relationships among recent (past-month) PM2.5 exposure, peripheral inflammatory markers, and anxiety and depressive symptoms in 78 adolescents (M ± SD = 13.3 ± 2.3 years, 48.7% female) from the Detroit, MI area. Higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were significantly associated with elevated levels of inflammatory lipid mediators: PGE2, 12(S)-HETE, 12(S)-HEPE, and 15(S)-HETE. A significant PM<sub>2.5</sub>-by-sex interaction was observed for IL-6, with higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure associated with higher IL-6 concentrations in females but not males. Additionally, higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were significantly associated with greater total anxiety, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms, but only in females. Higher IL-8 concentrations were associated with greater depressive symptoms, and a significant TNF-α-by-sex interaction was observed for total and social anxiety symptoms, with higher TNF-α concentrations linked to greater symptoms in females but not males. These findings suggest that PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure is associated with inflammation and anxiety symptoms in adolescence, with notable sex differences. As a modifiable risk factor, reducing outdoor air pollution exposure may help mitigate psychiatric symptoms in youth.

[PMID: 38805229] Growing evidence associates air pollution exposure with various psychiatric disorders. However, the importance of early-life (eg, prenatal) air pollution exposure to mental health during youth is poorly understood, and few longitudinal studies have investigated the association of noise pollution with youth mental health. To examine the longitudinal associations of air and noise pollution exposure in pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence with psychotic experiences, depression, and anxiety in youths from ages 13 to 24 years. This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort founded in 1991 through 1993 in Southwest England, United Kingdom. The cohort includes over 14 000 infants with due dates between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, who were subsequently followed up into adulthood. Data were analyzed October 29, 2021, to March 11, 2024. A novel linkage (completed in 2020) was performed to link high-resolution (100 m2) estimates of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter under 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and noise pollution to home addresses from pregnancy to 12 years of age. Psychotic experiences, depression, and anxiety were measured at ages 13, 18, and 24 years. Logistic regression models controlled for key individual-, family-, and area-level confounders. This cohort study included 9065 participants who had any mental health data, of whom (with sample size varying by parameter) 51.4% (4657 of 9051) were female, 19.5% (1544 of 7910) reported psychotic experiences, 11.4% (947 of 8344) reported depression, and 9.7% (811 of 8398) reported anxiety. Mean (SD) age at follow-up was 24.5 (0.8) years. After covariate adjustment, IQR increases (0.72 μg/m3) in PM2.5 levels during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.11 [95% CI, 1.04-1.19]; P = .002) and during childhood (AOR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.00-1.10]; P = .04) were associated with elevated odds for psychotic experiences. Pregnancy PM2.5 exposure was also associated with depression (AOR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.02-1.18]; P = .01). Higher noise pollution exposure in childhood (AOR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.03-1.38]; P = .02) and adolescence (AOR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.02-1.45]; P = .03) was associated with elevated odds for anxiety. In this longitudinal cohort study, early-life air and noise pollution exposure were prospectively associated with 3 common mental health problems from adolescence to young adulthood. There was a degree of specificity in terms of pollutant-timing-outcome associations. Interventions to reduce air and noise pollution exposure (eg, clean air zones) could potentially improve population mental health. Replication using quasi-experimental designs is now needed to shed further light on the underlying causes of these associations.

[PMID: 32097814] Recent studies indicate that exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) is associated with cognitive delay, depression, anxiety, autism, and neurodegenerative diseases; however, the role of PM in the etiology of these outcomes is not well-understood. Therefore, there is a need for controlled animal studies to better elucidate the causes and mechanisms by which PM impacts these health outcomes. We assessed the effects of gestational and early life exposure to traffic-related PM on social- and anxiety-related behaviors, cognition, inflammatory markers, and neural integrity in juvenile male rats. Gestating and lactating rats were exposed to PM from a Boston (MA, USA) traffic tunnel for 5 h/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks (3 weeks gestation, 3 weeks lactation). The target exposure concentration for the fine fraction of nebulized PM, measured as PM2.5, was 200 μg/m<sup>3</sup>. To assess anxiety and cognitive function, F1 male juveniles underwent elevated platform, cricket predation, nest building, social behavior and marble burying tests at 32-60 days of age. Upon completion of behavioral testing, multiple cytokines and growth factors were measured in these animals and their brains were analyzed with diffusion tensor MRI to assess neural integrity. PM exposure had no effect on litter size or weight, or offspring growth; however, F1 litters developmentally exposed to PM exhibited significantly increased anxiety (p = 0.04), decreased cognition reflected in poorer nest-organization (p = 0.04), and decreased social play and allogrooming (p = 0.003). MRI analysis of ex vivo brains revealed decreased structural integrity of neural tissues in the anterior cingulate and hippocampus in F1 juveniles exposed to PM (p < 0.01, p = 0.03, respectively). F1 juvenile males exposed to PM also exhibited significantly decreased plasma levels of both IL-18 (p = 0.03) and VEGF (p = 0.04), and these changes were inversely correlated with anxiety-related behavior. Chronic exposure of rat dams and their offspring to traffic-related PM during gestation and lactation decreases social behavior, increases anxiety, impairs cognition, decreases levels of inflammatory and growth factors (which are correlated with behavioral changes), and disrupts neural integrity in the juvenile male offspring. Our findings add evidence that exposure to traffic-related air pollution during gestation and lactation is involved in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder and other disorders which include social and cognitive deficits and/or increased anxiety.

[PMID: 31460967] Exposure to high levels of fine particle air pollution (PM2.5) is associated with adolescent pathophysiology. It is unclear, however, if PM2.5 is associated with physiology within psychosocial contexts, such as social stress, and whether some adolescents are particularly vulnerable to PM2.5-related adverse effects. This study examined the association between PM2.5 and autonomic reactivity to social stress in adolescents and tested whether symptoms of anxiety and depression moderated this association. Adolescents from Northern California (N = 144) participated in a modified Trier Social Stress Test while providing high-frequency heart rate variability and skin conductance level data. PM2.5 data were recorded from CalEnviroScreen. Adolescents reported on their own symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Youth Self-Report, which has been used in prior studies and has good psychometric properties (Cronbach's α in this sample was .86). Adolescents residing in neighborhoods characterized by higher concentrations of PM2.5 demonstrated greater autonomic reactivity (i.e., indexed by lower heart rate variability and higher skin conductance level) (β = .27; b = .44, p = .001, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.68) in response to social stress; this association was not accounted for by socioeconomic factors. In addition, adolescents who reported more severe anxiety and depression symptoms showed the strongest association between PM2.5 and autonomic reactivity to social stress (β = .53; b = .86, p < .001, 95% CI = 0.48 to 1.23). Exposure to PM2.5 may heighten adolescent physiological reactivity to social stressors. Moreover, adolescents who experience anxiety and depression may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of PM2.5 on stress reactivity.

[PMID: 25810495] To determine whether higher past exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with prevalent high symptoms of anxiety. Observational cohort study. Nurses' Health Study. 71,271 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study residing throughout the contiguous United States who had valid estimates on exposure to particulate matter for at least one exposure period of interest and data on anxiety symptoms. Meaningfully high symptoms of anxiety, defined as a score of 6 points or greater on the phobic anxiety subscale of the Crown-Crisp index, administered in 2004. The 71,271 eligible women were aged between 57 and 85 years (mean 70 years) at the time of assessment of anxiety symptoms, with a prevalence of high anxiety symptoms of 15%. Exposure to particulate matter was characterized using estimated average exposure to particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) and 2.5 to 10 μm in diameter (PM2.5-10) in the one month, three months, six months, one year, and 15 years prior to assessment of anxiety symptoms, and residential distance to the nearest major road two years prior to assessment. Significantly increased odds of high anxiety symptoms were observed with higher exposure to PM2.5 for multiple averaging periods (for example, odds ratio per 10 µg/m(3) increase in prior one month average PM2.5: 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.19; in prior 12 month average PM2.5: 1.15, 1.06 to 1.26). Models including multiple exposure windows suggested short term averaging periods were more relevant than long term averaging periods. There was no association between anxiety and exposure to PM2.5-10. Residential proximity to major roads was not related to anxiety symptoms in a dose dependent manner. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was associated with high symptoms of anxiety, with more recent exposures potentially more relevant than more distant exposures. Research evaluating whether reductions in exposure to ambient PM2.5 would reduce the population level burden of clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety is warranted.

[PMID: 41187385] First-generation Latinx immigrant youth face risks for experiencing unique immigration-related traumas, which could exacerbate their mental health. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of forced immigration-related family separation on the association between traditional adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) among Latinx immigrant youth from the Northern Triangle (NT; El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Primary surveys assessing forced immigration-related family separation, ACEs, and mental health were administered to a sample of NT immigrant youth (N = 172). Multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the study aim. In main effects analysis, forced immigration-related family separation was significantly associated with depression (B = 2.11, CI = [0.11, 4.11], p = .039) and PTSD (B = 4.01, CI = [0.63, 7.40], p = .021) symptoms. ACEs were significantly associated with depression (B = 1.34, CI = [0.86, 1.81], p < .001), anxiety (B = 1.05, CI = [0.63, 1.47], p < .001), and PTSD (B = 2.17, CI = [1.37, 2.97], p < .001) symptoms. In moderation effects analysis, the association of ACEs on depression (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.18, -0.25], p = .014), anxiety (B = -1.00, CI = [-1.86, -0.13], p = .024), and PTSD (B = -2.23, CI = [-3.84, -0.62], p = .007) symptoms was significantly attenuated among youth who experienced forced immigration-related family separation. Study findings may underscore the need to consider the inclusivity of immigration-related trauma in ACE assessment tools.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.",10

Among the various susceptibility genes, the gene of apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE</i>) is probably the most important. It may be present in three allelic forms, termed ε2, ε3 and ε4, and the most common genotype is the ε3/ε3. Recently, it has been observed that subjects with the ε4/ε4 genotype may show near-full penetrance of AD biology (pathology and biomarkers), leading to the suggestion that ε4 homozygosity may represent a distinct genetic type of AD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ε4 homozygosity or heterozygosity in the presence or absence of the AD biomarker profile in patients with cognitive disorders in the Greek population. A total of 274 patients were included in the study. They underwent <i>APOE</i> genotyping and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profiling. The presence of ε4 was associated with a lower age of symptom onset and decreased amyloid biomarkers (irrespective to AD or non-AD profiles), and predicted the presence of an AD profile by a positive predictive value approaching 100%. In conclusion, the ε4 allele has a significant effect on the risk and clinical parameters of cognitive impairment and AD in the Greek population, while the ε4/ε4 genotype may be highly indicative of the (co)existence of AD in cognitively impaired patients.

[PMID: 40273528] Recent research suggests that hippocampal-cerebellar (Hp-CB) functional connectivity may be altered early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD), given the early accumulation of AD pathology in the hippocampi and emerging evidence of cerebellar changes in early AD. This study analyzed the role of AD genetic risk (via APOE ε4 carrier status) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology (ratio of phosphorylated tau (p-tau<sub>181</sub>) to amyloid beta (Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>)) on the relationship between age and functional Hp-CB resting state fMRI connectivity in 161 cognitively unimpaired older adults (M age =67.3; SD =9.0; 37 % APOE ε4 +). In multiple regression analyses with Hp-CB connectivity as the outcome, there were significant interactions between age and APOE ε4 status, and between age and CSF AD biomarkers. Older age was associated with greater Hp-CB connectivity in APOE ε4 non-carriers and participants with less abnormal CSF AD biomarkers. In contrast, Hp-CB connectivity was marginally lower with older age in ε4 carriers and those with more abnormal AD biomarkers. Furthermore, greater Hp-CB connectivity was associated with better episodic memory performance across all groups. These findings suggest that age-related increases in Hp-CB connectivity among APOE ε4 non-carriers and those with low AD biomarker levels reflect age-related changes that are largely unrelated to AD, while age-related decreases in Hp-CB connectivity in APOE ε4 carriers may reflect AD-related alterations. These findings also highlight the importance of cerebellar contributions to cognitive performance among older adults and suggest that Hp-CB connectivity may be altered in preclinical AD.

[PMID: 40261309] BackgroundSubjective cognitive decline represents an early stage of mild cognitive impairment, with the Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI) serving to subjectively evaluate the decline in daily living activities associated with this minor cognitive decline.ObjectiveTo examine how CFI scores change with apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE4) carriage, objective cognitive decline, and dementia prevention intervention. We aimed to assess CFI's usefulness in the early dementia risk identification.MethodsThis study involved 196 older adults with normal cognition in a randomized controlled intervention trial. CFI was assessed every six months from baseline to 18 months, using the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC) to measure cognitive decline. We employed a mixed model for repeated measures to compare the CFI scores at 18 months in the ApoE4, ADCS-PACC, and allocation groups.ResultsCFI scores increased in ApoE4 carriers and decreased in the intervention group, with significant differences observed in the CFI score changes at 18 months between carriers and non-carriers and among the allocation groups (p = 0.002, p = 0.026, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in the CFI score change among ADCS-PACC groups (p = 0101).ConclusionsWe observed CFI scores worsening over time in individuals with ApoE4 and showing a tendency to deteriorate over time in those with objective cognitive decline. These findings suggest that the CFI may be able to identify high-risk individuals for dementia at an early stage. Furthermore, the improvement in the CFI score is considered a significant finding when considering future measures for subjective cognitive decline.

[PMID: 40239317] The APOE gene, particularly its ε4 allele, is a significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and influences amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and cognitive decline. This study explores the relationship between APOEε4 genotype, plasma levels of soluble ADAM10 (sADAM10), and cognitive performance in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults and those with AD dementia. It is a cross-sectional analysis that included 85 participants assessed for cognitive function, APOE genotype, and plasma sADAM10 levels. ADAM10, a key enzyme in the non-amyloidogenic pathway of Aβ precursor protein (APP) processing, has emerged as a promising biomarker due to its altered levels in AD patients. Our findings revealed significantly higher plasma sADAM10 levels in AD participants compared to CU individuals, with APOEε4 carriers exhibiting a nearly twofold increase in sADAM10 levels. A negative correlation was observed between plasma sADAM10 concentrations and cognitive performance, independent of APOEε4 status. Notably, the study highlights the potential of sADAM10 as a blood-based biomarker, emphasizing its relevance in APOEε4-mediated AD pathology. Importantly, most studies exploring ADAM10 and APOE interactions have been conducted in high-income countries, limiting the generalizability of their findings to diverse populations. This study is the first to be conducted in a Global South country, offering critical insights into underrepresented populations and underscoring the need for more inclusive research in AD. Future research should include larger cohorts and longitudinal designs to validate these findings and explore targeted interventions leveraging sADAM10 activity in the context of APOEε4-associated AD progression.

[PMID: 40220152] Cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficits, cognitive decline, and brain structural changes have been reported in older adults with and without apolipoprotein E-e4 (APOE4)-related risk for dementia. However, it remains unclear whether brain structural changes mediate the effects of hypoperfusion on cognitive impairment in APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. We studied 166 (60-89 years) APOE4 carriers (ε3/ε4 or ε4/ε4) and APOE3 homozygotes (e3/e3) with and without cognitive impairment by clinical dementia rating (CDR) and neuropsychological testing. Pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling-MRI assessed regional CBF, and T1-anatomical and diffusion-MRI assessed structural integrity. Mediation analyses examined relationships among grey matter CBF, grey matter volume, and white matter integrity in regions underlying impairment in distinct cognitive ability domains. APOE4 carriers with global/memory impairment (CDR 0.5) exhibited decreased CBF in the posterior cingulate, decreased grey matter volume in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and posterior cingulate, and decreased white matter integrity in the cingulum relative to APOE4 carriers with no impairment (CDR 0). Mediation analysis in APOE4 carriers indicated decreased posterior cingulate CBF effects on global/memory impairment were mediated by decreased cingulum integrity. In the combined APOE4 and APOE3 carriers sample, there were direct effects of frontal and inferior parietal CBF and superior longitudinal fasciculus integrity on attention/executive impairment. There were also direct effects of left inferior frontal CBF on language impairment. Findings suggest links between hypoperfusion and brain structural integrity underlying global/memory impairment in APOE4 carriers. Independent CBF relationships with structural integrity are also identified across genotypes and impairment domains.

[PMID: 40214756] Epidemiological studies indicate that type 2 diabetes increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in cerebral metabolism have been proposed as a potential mechanism underlying this association. A better understanding of these metabolic changes may elucidate potential pathways linking type 2 diabetes to Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the current exploratory study was to investigate whether cerebral metabolism, including glucose and fatty acid uptake as well as cerebral blood flow, is altered in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with both overweight individuals and lean control individuals. This exploratory study included 38 participants (ten with type 2 diabetes, 13 overweight individuals and 15 lean control individuals). Brain metabolism was assessed using multiple imaging techniques: [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-6-thiaheptadecanoic acid positron emission tomography for glucose and fatty acid uptake; arterial spin-labelling MRI for cerebral perfusion; and <sup>1</sup>H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy for specific metabolites. Neurodegeneration markers were evaluated from lumbar puncture samples. Group comparisons were assessed using one-way ANOVA and unpaired t tests, and correlations were assessed with linear regression. Individuals with type 2 diabetes exhibited lower cerebral glucose uptake compared with both lean and overweight groups (p<0.01). Cerebral perfusion was reduced in both participants with type 2 diabetes and overweight participants relative to lean control participants (p<0.01). Both glucose uptake and perfusion correlated negatively with HOMA-IR, insulin and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (p<0.001-p<0.05). White matter fatty acid uptake was elevated in the diabetes group compared with the lean group (p<0.05). Post hoc analyses revealed that lean APOE-ε4 carriers had increased fatty acid uptake in the entire brain relative to lean non-carriers. Among non-carriers of APOE-ε4, those with type 2 diabetes showed higher fatty acid uptake than lean control individuals (p<0.01-p<0.05), and this uptake correlated positively with HOMA-IR, insulin and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (p<0.05). Type 2 diabetes was associated with decreased cerebral perfusion and glucose uptake but increased fatty acid uptake in white matter. The elevated fatty acid uptake observed both in individuals with type 2 diabetes and in APOE-ε4 carriers suggests a common metabolic dysfunction for these Alzheimer's disease risk factors and suggests that targeting cerebral metabolic dysfunction, particularly fatty acid metabolism, could be a potential strategy for reducing the risk for neurodegeneration in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

[PMID: 40112813] The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest genetic risk modifier for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the APOE4 allele increasing risk and APOE2 decreasing it compared with the common APOE3 allele. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the temporal cortex from APOE2 carriers, APOE3 homozygotes, and APOE4 carriers, we found that AD-associated transcriptomic changes were highly APOE genotype dependent. Comparing AD with controls, APOE2 carriers showed upregulated synaptic and myelination-related pathways, preserving synapses and myelination at the protein level. Conversely, these pathways were downregulated in APOE3 homozygotes, resulting in reduced synaptic and myelination proteins. In APOE4 carriers, excitatory neurons displayed reduced synaptic pathways similar to APOE3, but oligodendrocytes showed upregulated myelination pathways like APOE2. However, their synaptic and myelination protein levels remained unchanged or increased. APOE4 carriers also showed increased pro-inflammatory signatures in microglia but reduced responses to amyloid-β pathology. These findings reveal APOE genotype-specific molecular alterations in AD across cell types.

[PMID: 40079311] Our previous preclinical study demonstrated that <i>APOE4</i>-targeted replacement mice exhibit more severe cerebral hypoperfusion and cognitive impairment than <i>APOE3</i>-targeted replacement mice with carotid artery stenosis due to neurovascular dysfunction. Therefore, we clinically investigate whether <i>APOE4</i> contributes to cerebral hemodynamic and cognitive impairment in subjects with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis or occlusion. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2022. In a primary analysis, 91 subjects (114 affected cerebral hemispheres) with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis or occlusion who underwent neuropsychological examinations and <sup>15</sup>O-gas positron emission tomography were included to examine associations of <i>APOE4</i> with cognitive impairment and cerebral hemodynamic impairment. A sensitivity analysis was performed with 161 subjects (201 affected cerebral hemispheres) who underwent <sup>15</sup>O-gas positron emission tomography scan. In the primary analysis, 20 (22.0%) subjects were <i>APOE4</i> carriers. <i>APOE4</i> was an independent risk factor of lower cerebral blood flow in the anterior circulation territory (β=-0.058 [95% CI, -0.098 to -0.018], <i>P</i>=0.005) and short-term memory impairment in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (β=1.16 [95% CI, 0.009-2.30], <i>P</i>=0.048) in a multivariable linear regression analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, 31 (19.3%) subjects carried <i>APOE4</i>, which was an independent risk factor of lower cerebral blood flow (β=-0.048 [95% CI, -0.079 to -0.012], <i>P</i>=0.003) in the anterior circulation territory. <i>APOE4</i> may confer an increased risk of decreased cerebral blood flow accompanied by memory impairment in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis or occlusion consistent with our experimental study. <i>APOE</i> genotyping in such subjects may be useful for early detection of disease severity.

[PMID: 39725857] The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane protein found in microglia within the brain, and its soluble form (sTREM2) has been shown to reduce amyloid deposition. Whether elevated TREM2-mediated microglial activity decreases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess whether high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of sTREM2 attenuate the risk of APOE ε4-associated amyloid pathology. We included 877 cognitively intact subjects from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study, including APOE ε4 carriers (n = 136) and non-carriers (n = 741). The linear regression was used to examine the interaction effect between CSF sTREM2 levels and APOE ε4 status on CSF Aβ42 levels. Additionally, subgroup analyses stratified by sex and age were conducted. Our main finding was that higher concentrations of CSF sTREM2 attenuated the effect of APOE ε4 carriage (i.e., the sTREM2 × APOE ε4 interaction) on amyloid deposition (β = -2.701e-05, p = 0.023). Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of interaction was still significant only in male (p = 0.041) and mid-life (p = 0.013) subgroups. Our study suggested that in cognitively intact individuals, changes in sTREM2 levels are associated with biomarkers of AD, and higher concentrations of CSF sTREM2 attenuated the risk of APOE ε4-related amyloid pathology. The identified role of the sTREM2 × APOE ε4 interaction in amyloid pathology offers new insights into potential strategies for AD prevention in APOE ε4 carriers.

[PMID: 39276310] Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) plays an important role responding to monomeric C-reactive protein (mCRP) via binding to CD31 leading to cerebrovascular damage and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using phosphor-proteomic profiling, we found altered cytoskeleton proteins in the microvasculature of AD brains, including increased levels of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) and the actin-related protein, LIMA1. To address the hypothesis that cytoskeletal changes serve as early pathological signatures linked with CD31 in brain endothelia in ApoE4 carriers, ApoE4 knock-in mice intraperitoneal injected with mCRP revealed that mCRP increased the expressions of phosphorylated CD31 (pCD31) and LIMA1, and facilitate the binding of pCD31 to LIMA1. mCRP combined with recombinant APOE4 protein decreased interaction of CD31 and VE-Cadherin at adherens junctions (AJs), along with altered the expression of various actin cytoskeleton proteins, causing microvasculature damage. Notably, the APOE2 protein attenuated these changes. Overall, our study demonstrates that ApoE4 responds to mCRP to disrupt the endothelial AJs which link with the actin cytoskeleton and this pathway could play a key role in the barrier dysfunction leading to AD risk.",10
Female carriers of the Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele have shorter lifetime exposure to estrogen due to a decreased reproductive period.,APOE4 AND Estrogen Exposure AND Reproductive Lifespan AND Female Carriers,"41187125,41186780,41186742,41185434,41185093,41184827,41184483,41183275,41183252,41183219","[PMID: 41187125] Previous reports have noted associations between infertility in women and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in later life. However, reports conflict regarding the associations between infertility and CVD risk factors. Using data from a population-based cohort of Black and White women, we examined the association between longitudinal assessments of CVD risk factors and infertility. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a prospective cohort of Black and White women who have undergone repeated assessment of CVD risk factors beginning at study baseline (1985-1986). Risk factors included cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid levels, glucose, and C-reactive protein. At approximately 40 years of age, an ancillary study assessed histories of infertility. We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link model to examine associations between infertility (dependent variable) and repeated CVD risk factors (independent variables), with adjustment for age, race, center, and education level in 1107 women. Cigarette use and higher levels of BMI, glucose, and triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) were associated with infertility after adjustment for age, race, and education. Cigarette use had the strongest associations with self-reported infertility in multivariable models (odds ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.64, 2.14). Women with infertility histories have adverse CVD risk factors across the reproductive lifespan, but cigarette use is the primary CVD risk factor for women's self-reported infertility.

[PMID: 41186780] The widespread use of pesticides such as deltamethrin (a pyrethroid) and acetamiprid (a neonicotinoid) has sparked concerns regarding their effects on human health, particularly their potential role in carcinogenesis. This study investigated the cytotoxic, molecular, and functional effects of these pesticides, individually and in combination, on the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line. This model was chosen to specifically investigate estrogen recpetor (ER)-independent mechanisms due to its expression of targets such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER); however, it does not reflect normal mammary cell responses. Cytotoxicity was assessed via XTT assays, migration was analyzed using wound-healing assays, and gene expression changes in AhR, PPARγ, and Caspase-3 were measured using RT-qPCR. Molecular docking was performed to predict pesticide-protein interactions, and in silico toxicity assessments using ProTox-II supplemented the in vitro results by predicting toxicity profiles relevant to public health. Both pesticides exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity, and their combination produced an additive effect on cell viability. Importantly, suppression of cell migration and downregulation of AhR and PPARγ expression reflected toxic stress responses at high pesticide concentrations, rather than therapeutic or anti-cancer potential. While apoptosis-related gene expression (Caspase-3) was increased, this effect did not reach statistical significance. Molecular docking supported strong interactions with key pathways related to xenobiotic metabolism and apoptosis. These findings emphasize that, at high and non-environmentally relevant concentrations, deltamethrin and acetamiprid induce additive cytotoxic effects and disrupt molecular processes in a mechanistic cancer model. The results highlight the need for further investigation using normal cell systems and environmentally relevant exposures to clarify real-world risk and biological mechanisms, and should not be interpreted as evidence of therapeutic activity. This study underscores the mechanistic relevance of pesticide exposure in environmental toxicology rather than any potential therapeutic application.

[PMID: 41186742] Pathological examination, the current gold standard for differentiating eyelid basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC), is invasive, time-consuming, and often inaccessible in primary care hospitals. Therefore, a non-invasive, early differential diagnostic method for eyelid BCC and SGC is needed to reduce diagnostic delays and improve accuracy, which holds significant clinical value, especially for Asian populations. Using 199 eyelid BCC and 171 eyelid SGC photographic images from Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (2016-2022), we developed a ResNet50-based deep learning model. The model's performance was evaluated using classification accuracy and the F1 score and was compared with that of four ophthalmologists (three junior and one senior). To assess its clinical utility, we further evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ophthalmologists with and without the model's assistance. The developed model achieved a differential diagnosis accuracy of 0.892 (95% CI 0.821-0.937), with a sensitivity of 0.863 (95% CI 0.743-0.932) and a specificity of 0.917 (95% CI 0.819-0.964), outperforming all four ophthalmologists (junior: 0.703 (95% CI 0.612-0.780), 0.757 (95% CI 0.669-0.827), 0.811 (95% CI 0.729-0.873); senior: 0.874 (95% CI 0.799-0.923)). With the model's assistance, diagnostic accuracy improved by 14.1%, 16.6%, and 2.2% for junior ophthalmologists and by 1.0% for the senior ophthalmologist. The developed model accurately differentiates eyelid BCC and SGC and effectively improves diagnostic performance, particularly for junior ophthalmologists. It may facilitate timely and appropriate treatment planning in clinical settings for eyelid BCC and SGC patients.

[PMID: 41185434] As more women with HIV survive into older age, the menopausal transition has emerged as a critical yet underexplored determinant in HIV pathogenesis. Declining exposure to estrogens during menopause alters innate and adaptive immunity, driving inflammation, comorbidities, and viral persistence. Estrogen influences both innate and adaptive immune responses. Estradiol enhances plasmacytoid dendritic cell type I interferon (IFN) production through Toll-like Receptor 7 (TLR7), promotes natural killer (NK) cell activity, and tempers monocyte/macrophage activation. Menopause reverses these effects, contributing to elevated inflammatory mediators. On the adaptive side, estrogen loss increases T-cell activation and exhaustion, impairs B-cell responses, and removes estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated suppression of HIV transcription. Together, these shifts may promote stabilization or expansion of the HIV reservoir in perimenopausal women with HIV, in contrast to the gradual decay often observed in men on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Estrogen depletion during menopause reshapes immunity in women with HIV, fueling chronic inflammation, comorbidity risk, and HIV reservoir persistence. Integrating reproductive aging into HIV cure and comorbidity research, and testing hormone-based and anti-inflammatory interventions, will be essential to improve health outcomes for aging women with HIV.

[PMID: 41185093] Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the apoE4 isoform (C112R) represents the strongest genetic risk factor. We combined binding-site mapping and discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations to elucidate isoform-specific apoE-Aβ interactions. Computational peptide-array analysis identified Aβ-binding hotspots in the apoE4 N-terminal domain (NTD) around R112, conferring greater Aβ-binding propensity than apoE3. DMD simulations showed that apoE4 NTD is less stable and more solvent-exposed, resulting in stronger Aβ binding, especially near the mutation site. Upon binding apoE NTDs, Aβ exhibited an increased β-sheet content, suggesting a lowered fibril nucleation barrier. Incorporating these insights into a recently established thermodynamic-kinetic framework of amyloid aggregation rationalizes apoE's biphasic effect on Aβ aggregation: apoE retards Aβ fibrillization at low Aβ-concentrations via monomer sequestration but accelerates the process at high concentrations by facilitating nucleation. Our findings offer mechanistic insight into the APOE genotype-dependent modulation of Aβ aggregation and may inform genotype-specific therapeutic strategies for AD.

[PMID: 41184827] Psychiatric disorders are increasingly conceptualised within a neurodevelopmental framework, in which genetic liability interacts with environmental exposures across the lifespan to shape brain and behavioural trajectories. Deviations in these trajectories may confer vulnerability or resilience to later psychopathology. Longitudinal cohorts spanning critical developmental windows are required to map these pathways and their associated risk and protective factors. The PAthways to Resilience And Mental health (PARAM) project is a multi-site longitudinal cohort in India, enrolling approximately 9,000 participants from the antenatal period to 30 years of age. PARAM extends the Consortium on the Vulnerability to Externalizing Disorders and Addictions (cVEDA) cohort, which recruited more than 9,000 individuals aged 6-23 years, by adding intensive follow-up from the fetal period to early childhood. Eight sites across India participate, with five recontacting their original cVEDA participants for repeated assessments. Repeated measures include questionnaires on development, temperament, and mental health; family medical and psychiatric history; assessments of environmental exposures such as adverse experiences, diet, maternal stress, toxic exposures, and screen use; and satellite-derived indicators of urbanisation and air pollution over time. Detailed examinations comprise anthropometry and body composition, neurocognitive testing, neurophysiological measures including heart rate variability and body sway, neuroimaging with 3T MRI and fNIRS, and biospecimen collection (blood, buccal swabs, hair, nails, urine, stool) for genomic, toxicological, and metabolic assays. Data are stored in a harmonised digital archive linked to a barcoded biorepository. Follow-up employs a closed cohort design for children younger than two years and an accelerated longitudinal design for older participants. Planned analyses include mixed-effects and generalized additive models for trajectories, multi-site imaging harmonisation and normative modelling, multivariate integration of multi-omic and imaging features, and predictive modelling with nested cross-validation and external validation where feasible. Missing data and attrition will be addressed using multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting. PARAM will offer insights into population-based developmental trajectories, identify modifiable risk and protective factors, and support predictive models for psychopathology. The findings are expected to inform precision interventions and public health strategies, while contributing a socio-culturally diverse resource to global mental health research.

[PMID: 41184483] Female reproductive aging is accompanied by a sharp increase in egg aneuploidy rates. Premature loss of chromosome cohesion proteins and early separation of chromosomes are thought to cause high aneuploidy rates during maternal aging. However, because cohesion loss occurs gradually throughout a woman's reproductive lifespan, and because cytoskeletal defects alone can lead to chromosomal abnormalities, the main causes of the rapid rise in aneuploidy at older reproductive ages are still unclear. In this study, we created a versatile and tunable cohesion manipulation system that enables rapid, dose-dependent degradation of the meiotic cohesin REC8 in live mouse oocytes. By coupling this system with quantitative high-resolution live imaging, we directly observed cohesion protein behavior during meiosis and tested the longstanding threshold model of aneuploidy development. Our results show that premature sister chromatid separation sharply increases only when REC8 levels drop below a critical threshold, supporting the idea of a nonlinear, vulnerability-triggering cohesion limit. We also used our system to examine how other age-related issues, such as cytoskeletal disruption and partial centromere dysfunction, can exacerbate chromatid separation in the context of weakened cohesion. This work provides a tractable oocyte platform for modeling and dissecting the multifactorial mechanisms driving female reproductive age-related egg aneuploidy.

[PMID: 41183275] Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a progressive neurologic disorder characterized by chronic inflammation in the CNS. HTLV-1-specific cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP; however, the dynamics of CTLs in the CSF remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the accumulation of HTLV-1-specific CTLs in the CSF of patients with HAM/TSP and to evaluate their association with neuroinflammation and neural damage. The frequency of HTLV-1-specific CTLs was compared between paired peripheral blood (PB) and CSF from patients with HAM/TSP and asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) using MHC/antigen tetramers. In addition, cytokine levels and neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentration were analyzed in the CSF of patients with HAM/TSP and ACs. The frequency of HTLV-1-specific CTLs in PB was significantly higher in patients with HAM/TSP compared with ACs (median [interquartile range (IQR)] = 3.0 [0.9-8.3] % vs 0.3 [0.2-3.1] %, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Notably, this difference was even more pronounced in CSF, where patients with HAM/TSP exhibited a significantly elevated frequency compared with ACs (19.1 [7.9-33.4] % vs 6.1 [0.9-15.7] %, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Furthermore, the frequency of HTLV-1-specific CTLs in the CSF was considerably higher than in the PB of patients with HAM/TSP (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The lack of accumulation of cytomegalovirus-specific CTLs indicates that HTLV-1-specific CTLs selectively accumulate in the CSF of patients with HAM/TSP. These accumulated HTLV-1-specific CTLs in the CSF significantly correlated with increased levels of cytokines in patients with HAM/TSP. In addition, CSF NfL levels were significantly higher in patients with HAM/TSP than in ACs (696 [534-1,407] vs 429 [373-717] pg/mL, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and showed a positive correlation with HTLV-1 proviral load. HTLV-1-specific CTLs selectively accumulate in the CSF of patients with HAM/TSP. Chronic inflammation, primarily driven by the interaction between proliferating HTLV-1-infected cells and accumulated HTLV-1-specific CTLs, may contribute to neural damage in patients with HAM/TSP.

[PMID: 41183252] Dementia and stroke are major global causes of disability, with modifiable lifestyle factors playing a significant role in their development. The updated LIfestyle for BRAin health (LIBRA2) score integrates 15 modifiable risk and protective factors to quantify lifestyle-based dementia risk, but its relationship with stroke and dementia subtypes remains unexplored. We investigated LIBRA2's association with stroke and dementia subtypes while also assessing potential interactions with genetic susceptibility. Prospective data were used from the French multicenter Three-City (3C) Study, with participants aged 65 years and older followed for up to 17 years. Weighted LIBRA2 scores at baseline were constructed based on the presence of 15 modifiable risk and protective factors, with higher scores representing higher lifestyle-based dementia risk. Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the association of LIBRA2 with incident dementia (and subtypes) and stroke, adjudicated by expert neurologist panels. Genetic susceptibility to dementia and stroke was assessed using <i>APOE</i> ε4 carriership and disease-specific genetic risk scores. Analyses included 4,731 participants for stroke (mean age 73.8 years, 60.1% female) and 4,737 participants for dementia (mean age 73.8 years, 59.9% female). One-point increases in LIBRA2 scores (theoretical range -6.1 to +25.7) were associated with increased dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08; 1.06-1.11), with a stronger association for vascular and mixed dementia (HR 1.13; 1.08-1.18) compared with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (HR 1.06; 1.03-1.09). LIBRA2 was not significantly associated with incident stroke risk (HR 1.03; 0.99-1.07). No significant interaction was found between LIBRA2 and <i>APOE</i> ε4 carriership or disease-specific genetic risk scores in relation to dementia subtypes or stroke. LIBRA2 serves as a valuable tool for assessing lifestyle-related dementia risk and its subtypes but showed no association with stroke, highlighting the potential for a stroke-specific risk reduction model. These associations were independent of genetic disease susceptibility, reinforcing the universal benefits of lifestyle modifications on dementia risk reduction. The stronger association between LIBRA2 (and some individual components) and vascular or mixed dementia, compared with AD dementia, highlights the pivotal role of vascular mechanisms in the relationship between lifestyle and brain health.

[PMID: 41183219] Several European countries have reported a rise in invasive Group A <i>Streptococcus</i> (GAS) infections, particularly linked to the toxigenic <i>emm1</i> sublineage M1<sub>UK</sub>. In Germany, historical molecular data are limited due to the absence of systematic molecular surveillance. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 189 invasive <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> isolates collected between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2023, at University Medical Center Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden. Clinical data were extracted from patient records. M1<sub>UK</sub> sublineage identification was based on 27 characteristic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A Bayesian coalescent analysis estimated the evolutionary timescales of the M1<sub>UK</sub> clade in Germany. The most common <i>emm</i> type was <i>emm1</i> (34%, 64/189), followed by <i>emm12</i>, <i>emm4</i>, and <i>emm89</i>. Of the 64 <i>emm1</i> isolates, 31 (48%) were M1<sub>UK</sub>. No significant associations were found between clinical outcomes and M1<sub>UK</sub> or M1<sub>global</sub> genotypes. Although a post-pandemic shift favouring M1<sub>UK</sub> was observed, our analysis indicates that M1<sub>UK</sub> had already been circulating in Germany by 2017. The estimated most recent common ancestor dates to 2012 (95% highest posterior density: 2009-2015), with a stable effective population size over time. Our findings confirm the pre-pandemic circulation of M1<sub>UK</sub> in Germany. While the clinical impact of M1<sub>UK</sub> remains unclear, integrating clinical data with high-resolution molecular surveillance may improve early detection of emerging high-risk clones.",10

Our study investigates the chronic (60-day) neurotoxic impacts of environmentally relevant concentrations of Cu (0.85 mg/L) and PVC-MPs (0.5 mg/L), both individually and in combination, in freshwater food-fish Channa punctatus. The neurotoxic effects were evaluated through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation; oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids; disruption of neurotransmitters; neuro-architectural damage, and neuronal cell death. For the first time, we identified neural apoptosis in fish via the BDNF/miR132/FOXO3a axis upon exposure to Cu, PVC-MPs, and their mixture. Cu accumulation peaked in brains treated with Cu-PVC-MPs combination. Higher ROS levels were seen in the exposed brain tissue, along with signs of oxidative damage, such as increased lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyls (PC), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Increased monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity led to dopamine and serotonin depletion, while cholinergic dysfunction was marked by reduced choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and acetylcholine (ACh). Additionally, severe neuro-architectural damage was observed. Molecular alterations were amplified in brains exposed to the copper-PVC-MPs mixture. Transcriptional analyses revealed downregulation of bdnf, miR132 and bcl2, with concurrent upregulation of foxo3a, bim, bax, apaf1, cas9, and cas3, further validated apoptosis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Pearson Correlation analyses were also performed to validate these findings. Our results underscore the growing environmental threat posed by combined copper and MPs pollution, with PVC acting as a vehicle for increased toxicity in aquatic life.

[PMID: 40237798] Calycosin, a naturally occurring isoflavonoid found predominantly in Astragalus membranaceus, exhibits significant therapeutic potential in various neurological conditions. Its multifaceted bioactive properties-antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic-position it as a promising candidate for neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. This review explores calycosin's mechanisms of action, including its modulation of key signaling pathways such as HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB (high mobility group box 1/toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 K)/Akt, ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), and Hsp90/Akt/p38. In cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, calycosin reduces oxidative stress markers like ROS (reactive oxygen species) and MDA (malondialdehyde), enhances antioxidant enzymes (SOD (superoxide dismutase) and GPX (glutathione peroxidase)), and downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) through the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway. It also inhibits autophagy via the STAT3/FOXO3a pathway and apoptosis by modulating Bax and Bcl-2 expression. In neuro-oncology, calycosin inhibits glioblastoma cell migration and invasion by modulating the TGF-β-mediated mesenchymal properties and suppressing the c-Met and CXCL10 signaling pathways. Additionally, it enhances the efficacy of temozolomide in glioma treatment through apoptotic pathways involving caspase-3 and caspase-9. Calycosin shows promise in Alzheimer's disease by reducing β-amyloid production and tau hyperphosphorylation via the GSK-3β pathway and improving mitochondrial function through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-Alpha (PGC-1α)/mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) signaling pathway. In Parkinson's disease, calycosin mitigates oxidative stress, prevents dopaminergic neuronal death, and reduces neuroinflammation by inhibiting the TLR/NF-κB and MAPK pathways. It has also shown therapeutic potential in meningitis and even neuroprotective effects against hyperbilirubinemia-induced nerve injury. Despite these promising findings, further research, including detailed mechanistic studies and clinical trials, is needed to fully understand calycosin's therapeutic mechanisms and validate its potential in human subjects. Developing advanced delivery systems and exploring synergistic therapeutic strategies could further enhance its clinical application and effectiveness.

[PMID: 37113744] The accumulation and aggregation of <i>α</i>-synuclein is a pathognomonic sign of Parkinson's disease (PD). Maneb (MB) exposure has also been reported as one environmental triggering factor of this multifactorial neurodegenerative disease. In our laboratory, we have previously reported that mild overexpression of <i>α</i>-synuclein (200% increase with respect to endogenous neuronal levels) can confer neuroprotection against several insults. Here, we tested the hypothesis that <i>α</i>-synuclein can modulate the neuronal response against MB-induced neurotoxicity. When exposed to MB, cells with endogenous <i>α</i>-synuclein expression displayed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with diminished glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (<i>GCLc</i>) and hemeoxygenase-1 (<i>HO-1</i>) mRNA expressions and upregulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) repressor, BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1). We found that <i>α</i>-synuclein overexpression (wt <i>α</i>-syn cells) attenuated MB-induced neuronal damage by reducing oxidative stress. Decreased ROS found in MB-treated wt <i>α</i>-syn cells was associated with unaltered <i>GCLc</i> and <i>HO-1</i> mRNA expressions and decreased BACH1 expression. In addition, the increased SOD2 expression and catalase activity were associated with forkhead box O 3a (FOXO3a) nuclear compartmentalization. Cytoprotective effects observed in wt <i>α</i>-syn cells were also associated with the upregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1). In control cells, MB-treatment downregulated glutathione peroxidase 4 mRNA levels, which was coincident with increased ROS content, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial alterations. These deleterious effects were prevented by ferrostatin-1, an inhibitor of ferroptosis, under conditions of endogenous <i>α</i>-synuclein expression. The overexpression of <i>α</i>-synuclein attenuated MB toxicity by the activation of the same mechanisms as ferrostatin-1. Overall, our findings suggest that mild overexpression of <i>α</i>-synuclein attenuates MB-induced neurotoxicity through the modulation of NRF2 and FOXO3a transcription factors and prevents cell death probably by intervening in mechanisms associated with ferroptosis. Thus, we postulate that early stages of <i>α</i>-synuclein overexpression could be potentially neuroprotective against MB neurotoxicity.

[PMID: 35155508] alpha-Mangostin, a polyphenolic xanthone, is primarily found in the pericarp of mangosteen throughout Southeast Asia and is considered as the ""Queen of Fruit"" in Thailand. Nonetheless, it is not clarified how alpha-mangostin protects neuronal cells against oxidative stress. In this study, molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of alpha-mangostin in defending hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced neurotoxicity was explored. cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptotic cascades, and protein expression profiles were performed incorporation of molecular docking. Human SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with 1 μM alpha-mangostin for 3 h prior to exposure to 400 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. alpha-Mangostin significantly inhibited oxidative stress-induced cell death in neuronal cells by reducing BAX protein, decreasing caspase-3/7 activation, and increasing anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein. Collectively, alpha-mangostin was demonstrated to be a prominent ROS suppressor which reversed the reduction of antioxidant enzymes (CAT and SOD2). Surprisingly, alpha-mangostin significantly promoted the expression of the sirtuin family and the FOXO3a transcription factor exerting beneficial effects on cell survival and longevity. A molecular docking study predicted that alpha-mangostin is directly bound to the active site of SIRT1. Findings from this study suggest that alpha-mangostin potentially serves as a promising therapeutic compound against oxidative stress by activation of the SIRT1/3-FOXO3a pathway comparable to the effect of memantine, an anti-AD drug used for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia.

[PMID: 35115638] Stroke causes degeneration and death of neurones leading to the loss of motor function and frequent occurrence of cognitive impairment and depression. Lithium (Li<sup>+</sup>), the archetypal mood stabiliser, is neuroprotective in animal models of stroke, albeit underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We discover that Li<sup>+</sup> inhibits activation of nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model in mice. This action of Li<sup>+</sup> is mediated by two signalling pathways of AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin and AKT/FoxO3a/β-catenin which converge in suppressing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using immunocytochemstry, MRI imaging, and cell sorting with subsequent mRNA and protein quantification, we demonstrate that Li<sup>+</sup> decreases the infarct volume, improves motor function, and alleviates associated cognitive and depressive impairments. In conclusion, this study reveals molecular mechanisms of Li<sup>+</sup> neuroprotection during brain ischaemia, thus providing the theoretical background to extend clinical applications of Li<sup>+</sup> for treatment of ischemic stroke.

[PMID: 35498835] Neuronal cell death is a key feature of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Plant polyphenols, namely butein, isoliquiritigenin, and scopoletin, have been shown to exhibit various biological activities including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities. Herein, butein, isoliquiritigenin, and scopoletin were explored for their neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress-induced human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cell death. The cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) revealed a reduction in cell viability and increases in apoptosis and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with 5 μM of butein, isoliquiritigenin, or scopoletin protected against the cell death induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and decreased the levels of apoptotic cells and ROS. In addition, the levels of SIRT1, FoxO3a, ADAM10, BCL-2, and antioxidant enzymes (catalase and SOD2) were maintained in the cells pretreated with butein, isoliquiritigenin, or scopoletin before H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment compared to cells without pretreatment and the reference (resveratrol). Molecular docking analysis revealed that the interactions between the activator-binding sites of SIRT1 and the phenolic compounds were similar to those of resveratrol. Taken together, the data suggest that these polyphenolic compounds could be potential candidates for prevention and/or treatment of neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 32044446] The detrimental effects of oxidative stress caused by the accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) factor into aging, senescence and several neurodegenerative diseases. Mammalian models are extremely susceptible to the stresses that follow the restoration of oxygen after anoxia; however some organisms including the freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta can withstand extended anoxia and reoxygenation without apparent pathology. The ability of the turtle to withstand these conditions is thought to be linked to the upregulation of protective mechanisms such as heat shock proteins (HSP) as well as the suppression of ROS formation and the upregulation of antioxidant defenses. One such antioxidant mechanism is the transcription factor Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), that has been shown to be activated in several animal models during oxidative stress. In this study, we utilized both the transfection of a plasmid carrying foxo3a and the pharmacological manipulation of foxo3a using the green tea extract Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to investigate the protective role of FOXO3a in the turtle brain. Our studies found that transcript levels of foxo3a were upregulated significantly during reoxygenation with greater increases during chemical oxidative stress. Induction of foxo3a by direct transfection significantly decreased cell death during chemical oxidative stress. Cells treated with EGCG also showed increased foxo3a expression and decreased cell death in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These results agree with results seen in other animal models and suggest that EGCG (through the upregulation of foxo3a) may be a therapeutic target against oxidative stress damage that warrants further investigation.

[PMID: 30929586] <b>Background:</b> An imbalance of free radicals and antioxidant defense systems in physiological processes can result in protein/DNA damage, inflammation, and cellular apoptosis leading to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Sesamin and sesamol, compounds derived from sesame seeds and oil, have been reported to exert various pharmacological effects, especially antioxidant activity. However, their molecular mechanisms against the oxidative stress induced by exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) remain to be elucidated. <b>Aim:</b> In this study, neuroprotective effects of sesamin and sesamol on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell death and possible signaling pathways in the cells were explored. <b>Methods:</b> MTT assay and flow cytometry were conducted to determine cell viability and apoptotic profiles of neuronal cells treated with sesamin and sesamol. Carboxy-DCFDA assay was used to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, Western blot analysis was performed to investigate protein profiles associated with neuroprotection. <b>Results:</b> Pretreatment of the cells with 1 µM of sesamin and sesamol remarkably reduced the SH-SY5Y cell death induced by 400 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as well as the intracellular ROS production. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuroprotection of the compounds were associated with activating SIRT1-SIRT3-FOXO3a expression, inhibiting BAX (proapoptotic protein), and upregulating BCL-2 (anti-apoptotic protein). <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings suggest that sesamin and sesamol are compounds that potentially protect neuronal cells against oxidative stress similar to that of the resveratrol, the reference compound. These antioxidants are thus of interest for further investigation in <i>in vivo</i> models of neuroprotection.

[PMID: 30617363] Lanthanum (La) can cause central nervous system damage in rats and lead to learning and memory impairment, but the relevant mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Autophagy is the self-balancing and self-renewal process of cells that degrades damaged macromolecules and organelles through the lysosomal pathway. It is an important mechanism to resist harmful stress, but excessive autophagy leads to type II programmed cell death. A variety of chemicals can induce oxidative stress, and a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can regulate the level of autophagy through multiple signaling pathways. Our previous studies showed that La could cause oxidative stress, inhibit Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and impair learning and memory, but it is unclear whether the mechanism is related to autophagic disorders of neurons. In this study, Wistar rats were exposed to 0% (w/v), 0.25%, 0.5% and 1.0% lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) through their mother and drinking water from the embryonic phase to 1 month after weaning, and then the subsequent experiments were performed. The results showed that LaCl3 impaired spatial learning and memory and avoidance conditioning in rats and induced an increase in ROS levels in hippocampal nerve cells, which up-regulated p-JNK, p-c-Jun, p-FoxO1, p-FoxO3a, Beclin1 and LC3B-II expression and down-regulated p-AKT, p-mTOR and p62 expression. Meanwhile, the number of autophagosomes in hippocampal neurons in the 1.0% LaCl3-treated group was significantly increased. These results indicate that La can activate the JNK/c-Jun and JNK/FoxOs signaling pathways, inhibit the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by inducing oxidative stress, and enhance autophagy in the hippocampus. This study suggests that the mechanism of learning and memory impairment induced by LaCl3 may be related to excessive autophagy.

[PMID: 30320335] Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd. (sweet tea; ST) leaves is a type of Chinese folkloric medicine from southern China. The purpose of the present study was to explore the neuroprotective effect of ST, and to explore its underlying mechanisms in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)‑induced neuronal cell injury in cultured human neuroblastoma. H2O2 was used as oxidant inducer and human SH‑SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with various concentrations of ST. Cell viability and cell death were detected using MTT and LDH assays, respectively. Additionally, the production of intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by 2',7'‑dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH‑DA) and MitoSOX Red, respectively. The production of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) level, glutathione peroxidase (GSH‑Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and NAD+/NADH ratio were confirmed using relevant kits. The expression of adenosine monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor coactivator (PGC)‑1α, Sirt3, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)2, forkhead boxO3a (Foxo3a), and SOD2 were analyzed by western blot analysis. It was demonstrated that pre‑treatment with ST enhanced cell viability and repressed cell death, and it also reduced intracellular and mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Additionally, ST attenuated MDA production and enhanced GSH level, GSH‑Px and SOD activities. Furthermore, ST not only increased NAD+/NADH ratio, but also inhibited the decrease of AMPK, PGC‑1α, Sirt3, IDH2, Foxo3a, and SOD2. The present study revealed that ST exerts protective effects against oxidative stress‑induced SH‑SY5Y cells injury, and the underlying mechanisms are, at least partly, associated with its antioxidant capacity and function through mitochondrial Sirt3 signaling pathway.",10
Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori decreases risk of gastric cancer in humans.,Helicobacter pylori AND Gastric cancer risk AND Protective effect AND Gastric neoplasm,"40964055,40771613,40502348,40478405,40411354,40200873,39880367,39877710,39784713,39781526","[PMID: 40964055] <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) is a Group 1 gastric carcinogen increasingly implicated in extragastric digestive malignancies. This review synthesizes evidence on its role in liver, biliary, esophageal, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. Based on its unique spiral morphology, flagellar motility bundle, and urease activity-mediated acidic niche adaptation, <i>H. pylori</i> disrupts host cellular homeostasis through multifactorial virulence mechanisms involving CagA/VacA synergy, and exploits antigenic variation and immunomodulatory strategies to achieve persistent gastric mucosal colonization and chronic infection. Emerging evidence suggests associations between <i>H. pylori</i> infection and nongastric digestive cancers, though relationships vary by site. For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), epidemiological studies indicate increased risk (OR 4.75), particularly with HCV coinfection, but mechanistic and cohort data remain conflicting. Biliary tract cancer (BTC) shows stronger epidemiological links, especially for cholangiocarcinoma (OR 4.18), supported by virulence factor detection. In esophageal cancer, <i>H. pylori</i> particularly CagA+ strains demonstrates a protective effect against adenocarcinoma but no significant association with squamous cell carcinoma. Colorectal cancer exhibits complex associations, with meta-analyses suggesting increased risk in East Asian populations and potential benefits from eradication therapy. Pancreatic cancer links remain inconsistent. Proposed mechanisms of <i>H. pylori</i> in extragastric cancers include chronic inflammation, virulence factor activity and microbiome disruption. This comprehensive review synthesizes contemporary evidence on the bacterium's role in non-gastric digestive malignancies, examines pathways underlying its oncogenicity, and outlines translational implications for risk stratification and therapeutic innovation.

[PMID: 40771613] <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>Hp</i>) is the strongest known risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma. We previously demonstrated that iron deficiency, a condition of the exposome, augments <i>Hp</i>-induced carcinogenesis. To define mechanisms driving this phenotype, we performed targeted metabolomics in mice which revealed that <i>Hp</i> significantly increased levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA), a carcinogenic secondary bile acid, exclusively under iron-deficient conditions. Further, DCA directly promoted <i>Hp</i>-induced dysplasia. Because bile acids and fatty acids can exert opposing effects on disease, fatty acids were also assessed within the context of iron deficiency and infection. In contrast to bile acids, long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) were significantly downregulated by <i>Hp</i> under iron-deficient conditions, including levels of palmitic acid, a LCFA with therapeutic potential against gastric cancer. These data indicate that <i>Hp</i> increases levels of carcinogenic secondary bile acids with concordant reductions in protective LCFAs under iron-deficient conditions, suggesting an active interplay between these effectors in cancer risk.

[PMID: 40502348] Gastric cancer is a significant health problem owing to its high incidence and mortality rate. The risk factors for gastric cancer include both uncontrollable (e.g., age, sex, and genetic predisposition) and controllable factors (e.g., <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and high-salt diets). Although treatment of <i>H. pylori</i> infections has been implemented as a primary preventive measure, the risk of gastric cancer may persist, highlighting the need for additional preventive measures. This review discusses various risks and protective factors associated with gastric cancer, studies conducted on these factors, and chemoprevention. Smoking is a risk factor for this disease; thus, is not recommended and current smokers are encouraged to quit because cessation can reduce the risk of gastric cancer. Excessive alcohol intake has been reported to increase the risk of gastric cancer as has the consumption of high-salt foods that can damage the gastric mucosa. Additionally, increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables, known for their protective effects against gastric cancer, can aid in its prevention. Studies on chemopreventive agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., aspirin), statins, and metformin, have been reported; however, evidence of their effectiveness remains insufficient to recommend these agents as preventive treatments. Additional well-planned studies on preventive medications and dietary approaches are necessary.

[PMID: 40478405] Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Central America, where Helicobacter pylori infection is highly prevalent. This study aimed to assess the association between regular use of aspirin (ASA) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma in this high-incidence region. A case-control study was conducted with 1067 incident cases of gastric cancer and 1745 controls. Helicobacter pylori and CagA status were evaluated for 1009 cases and 1557 controls. Demographic, lifestyle, and ASA/NSAID use data were collected via structured interviews. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted ORs (aORs) for the relationship between ASA/NSAID use and gastric cancer risk, controlling for demographic and clinical factors. The prevalence of H. pylori and CagA-positive infection were 90.0% and 85%, respectively. Significant tobacco and alcohol use were limited, 3.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Logistic regression revealed that ASA use was inversely associated with gastric cancer risk, with an unadjusted OR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.40, 1.26), and adjusted aOR of 0.49 (95% CI 0.26, 0.91). NSAID use showed no significant association after adjustment (aOR: 1.18; 95% CI 0.75, 1.87). Regular ASA use is associated with a significant reduction in gastric cancer risk, while NSAID use showed no significant protective effect. Future research should include controlled trials, and the cost-benefit trade-off between ASA's protective effects and gastrointestinal bleeding risks.

[PMID: 40411354] Gastric cancer is still a prevalent and lethal cancer. Gastric hypoacidity and gastritis have long been recognized in the pathogenesis. The identification of <i>Helicobacter(H.) pylori</i> as the main cause of gastritis leading to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer was a breakthrough. <i>H. pylori</i> was the first bacterium accepted as a carcinogen. The mechanism was not found before <i>H. pylori</i> was shown to predispose to cancer only after having induced oxyntic atrophy incriminating reduced killing of microorganisms and/or secondary hypergastrinemia. <i>H. pylori</i> has an uncertain carcinogenic role in cardia cancer, making microbes more unlikely. Gastrin has a trophic effect on the oxyntic mucosa, particularly on the enterochromaffin like cell carrying the gastrin receptor. Every condition with long-term hypergastrinemia in whatever species predisposes to gastric neoplasia. All observations on gastric neoplasia connected to <i>H. pylori</i> gastritis (the protective effect of duodenal ulcer, increased risk with oxyntic atrophy and preserved risk after loss of <i>H. pylori</i> in complete oxyntic atrophy) may be explained by gastrin. The role of gastrin in gastric carcinogenesis is also reflected by autoimmune gastritis and profound long-term gastric acid inhibition.

[PMID: 40200873] Despite extensive research on gastric cancer (GC), efforts to consolidate the numerous associations between possible factors and GC risk remain lacking. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of potential GC-associated pairs. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, from their inception to April 23, 2022, for eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses to investigate the association between any possible factors and GC risk. After the inclusion of 75 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 117 association pairs were examined. We reanalyzed the included meta-analyses and produced effect estimates using uniform analytical models. The certainty of the evidence for each association pair was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Iatrogenic factors, including antibacterial drugs, were associated with an increased risk of GC. Epstein-Barr virus and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infections were also associated with an increased risk of GC, while human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infections were associated with a reduced risk. Dietary habit was a major factor influencing moderate to high GRADE associations. Positive associations were observed for heavy alcohol consumption (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.12), refined grain consumption (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.21-1.53), and habitual salt intake (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.04-1.91). The associations between GC risk and dietary and nutritional factors were considerably heterogeneous, whereas other factors, such as lifestyle and iatrogenic and environmental exposures, were consistent across regions. Therefore, dietary interventions for GC prevention should be tailored specific to regions. PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42020209817.

[PMID: 39880367] Gastric cancer (GC) is a significant global health challenge, particularly in high-incidence regions like East Asia. Despite improvements in screening and treatment, the progressive nature of precancerous lesions-such as atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia-necessitates effective prevention strategies. This review evaluates the role of chemoprevention in GC, focusing on agents designed to target these precancerous lesions. The interventions examined include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), COX-2 inhibitors, antioxidants, vitamins, folic acid, bioactive compounds, traditional herbal medicines and emerging agents like metformin. Additionally, the potential of oxygen radical scavengers, anti-inflammatory agents and pathway-specific inhibitors is explored. While promising, the clinical effectiveness of these agents varies, and significant challenges remain in translating preclinical successes into clinical practice. Large-scale clinical trials are essential to validate these strategies and determine their role in GC prevention, particularly for high-risk populations. Integrating chemoprevention with existing GC management protocols may offer a more comprehensive approach to reducing GC incidence and improving outcomes.

[PMID: 39877710] <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) infection has a protective effect on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Both of these diseases have a very high incidence and prevalence. As a result, GERD often recurs after anti-<i>Helicobacter</i> therapy. The problem of effective treatment of <i>H. pylori</i> infection and GERD is that the main groups of drugs [proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and potassium-competitive acid blockers] have the possibility of side effects with use. Such supposed side effects have no evidence in randomized controlled trials that comply with the principles of evidence-based medicine. Morphological changes in the gastric mucosa after long-term use of antisecretory drugs should be considered as compensatory mechanisms of sanogenesis. The greatest concern for doctors who treat patients with antisecretory drugs is the risk of gastric carcinogenesis. This article presents an analysis of morphological and pathophysiological changes that occur after long-term use of antisecretory drugs (PPIs). Hypertrophy (hyperplasia) of G cells, enterochromaffin-like cells and possible fundic gland polyps (hyperplasia) are compensatory mechanisms of sanogenesis during long-term treatment with PPIs. These mechanisms are of primary importance for rehabilitation and prevention of complications in patients with GERD, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-gastropathy and other diseases during long-term treatment with PPIs. Understanding the pathophysiological and morphological mechanisms of compensation and adaptation, the mechanisms of sanogenesis and carcinogenesis will increase the number of indications for long-term use of PPIs with a high level of efficiency and safety of treatment. In addition, understanding the pathophysiological and morphological mechanisms of compensation and adaptation, the mechanisms of sanogenesis will allow us to forecast the side effects of long-term use of potassium-competitive acid blockers.

[PMID: 39784713] atrophic gastritis has a high risk of progressing to gastric cancer. Screening early gastric cancer and predicting the risk of atrophic gastritis developing into gastric cancer could improve the prognosis. this study evaluated the significance of miR-1260b in early gastric cancer and the progression of atrophic gastritis to gastric cancer aiming to explore a reliable biomarker. the study enrolled 78 early gastric cancer patients and 77 atrophic gastritis patients. The expression of miR-1260b was detected in serum and tissue samples by PCR. The risk of atrophic gastritis patients progressing to gastric cancer was assessed and correlated with miR-1260b levels. The potential of miR-1260b to distinguish early gastric cancer was evaluated by ROC. In vitro, gastric cancer cells were infected with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), and the regulatory effect of miR-1260b on cell growth and metastasis was evaluated by CCK8 and Transwell assay. significant upregulation of miR-1260b was observed in early gastric cancer patients relative to atrophic gastritis patients, which distinguishes early gastric cancer patients and showed a positive correlation with the risk of atrophic gastritis patients developing gastric cancer. Early gastric cancer patients with positive H. pylori infection had higher miR-1260b levels, and increasing miR-1260b was also observed in H. pylori-infected gastric cancer cells. H. pylori promoted cell growth and metastasis of gastric cancer while silencing miR-1260b alleviated these effects. miR-1260b negatively regulated ZNF302, and the knockdown of ZNF302 reversed the protective effect of miR-1260 knockdown on gastric cancer cells. increasing miR-1260b can assist in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer and predict the risk of gastric cancer in atrophic gastritis patients. Silencing miR-1260b may alleviate the promotion of gastric cancer induced by H. pylori via negative modulation of ZNF302.

[PMID: 39781526] <b>Background:</b> Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health challenge. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze GC epidemiology and risk factors to inform prevention and intervention strategies. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 data, conducted 16 different machine learning (ML) models of NHANES data, performed Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on disease phenotypes, dietary preferences, microbiome, blood-based markers, and integrated differential gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from multiple cohorts to identify factors associated with GC risk. <b>Results:</b> Global age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates (ASDR) for GC declined from 886.24 to 358.42 per 100,000 population between 1990 and 2030, with significant regional disparities. Despite this decline, total disability-adjusted life years show a concerning upward trend from 2015, rising from approximately 22.9 million to a projected 24.3 million by 2030. The slope index of inequality shifted from 87 in 1990 to -184 in 2021, indicating a reversal in GC burden distribution, with higher ASDR now associated with lower socio-demographic index countries. The ML models analysis identified higher levels of clinical characteristics such as phosphorus, calcium, eosinophils percent, and triglycerides, as well as lower levels of iron and monocyte percent, may be associated with an increased risk of GC. MR analyses revealed causal associations between GC risk and disease phenotypes such as <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection, chronic gastritis, obesity, depression, and dietary preferences such as dairy and processed meats. Gut microbiome analysis showed associations with microbiome such as <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> species. Blood-based markers analysis identified protective and risk effects for cortisol, glutamate, nicotinamide, Natural Killer %lymphocyte, CD4-CD8- T cell Absolute Count, Phosphatidylcholine (16:0_18:1), and Interleukin-1-alpha. Integrated genomic analysis identified 10 genes significantly associated with GC risk, with strong evidence for colocalization in genes such as <i>CCR6</i> and <i>PILRB</i>. <b>Conclusions:</b> This systematic analysis reveals complex global trends in GC burden and identifies novel clinical, disease phenotypes, dietary preferences, microbial, blood-based, and genetic risk factors. These findings provide potential targets for improved risk stratification, prevention, and intervention strategies to reduce the global burden of GC.",10
General exercise therapy is more effective than rotator cuff exercises in reducing pain and improving function of the shoulder.,exercise therapy AND rotator cuff exercises AND pain reduction AND shoulder function,"40700393,40649139,40371595,39635498,39189423,39121188,38682089,37959210,37490337,36868297","[PMID: 40700393] Non-operative management of patients with rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP) has been shown to be effective with outcomes similar to operative interventions. Exercise therapy and education are recommended as first-line treatments; however, program content, progression and referral criteria are typically inadequately detailed to be easily reproduced by clinicians. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a well-defined, criteria-based progressive exercise physical therapy (PT) program in patients with rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP) over a 26-week evaluation period. A longitudinal, prospective cohort study evaluated 143 patients aged 30-65 years with RCRSP. Participants participated in a 12-week in-person and home-exercise shoulder program and were assessed at baseline, 6-weeks, 12-weeks and 26-weeks. Primary outcome measures were pain at rest, at night and with activity. Secondary measures were active range of motion (ROM), strength, and health related quality of life (HRQL) using the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) score. Significant reductions in pain at rest, at night and with activity (p < 0.001) occurred within six weeks and continued to 26-weeks. Active range of motion (ROM), particularly abduction and external rotation in 90 degrees of abduction, significantly improved between 0- and 6-weeks (p < 0.001) as well as at 12-weeks (p < 0.001) and 26-weeks (p < 0.001). Strength similarly improved, especially between 6- and 12-weeks (p < 0.001). Ongoing improvements were reported at 26-weeks. Finally, the WORC score improved over time, with significant improvements at each measurement point, and clinically important improvements occurring within 12 weeks. Utilizing a criteria-based progressive PT program that provided detailed information, including progression criteria and a proven algorithm for referring non-responsive patients for an orthopedic surgical consult was effective in significantly reducing pain, improving active ROM, strength and HRQL in those living with RCRSP.

Primary outcomes included pain intensity and shoulder function, assessed at 12 weeks. A frequentist NMA was conducted to estimate standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. <b>Results:</b> Eleven RCTs (<i>n</i> = 548) were included. Combination therapy demonstrated the greatest improvement in function (SMD = -1.02; 95% CI: -2.59 to 0.56) and pain (SMD = -1.05; 95% CI: -2.41 to 0.30), although the wide confidence intervals crossing the null suggests statistical uncertainty. Exercise therapy alone showed moderate functional improvement (SMD = -0.41; 95% CI: -1.64 to 0.82), and Kinesio taping (KT) provided moderate pain relief (SMD = -0.53; 95% CI: -1.81 to 0.75). While these effects approached known minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds (e.g., DASH: 10-15; VAS: 1.4-2.0), they did not reach statistical significance. <b>Conclusions:</b> Based on 11 RCTs, combination therapy (exercise plus manual therapy) appears to be the most effective non-invasive approach for improving pain and function in patients with RCRSP. However, the wide confidence intervals highlight uncertainty. Further large-scale and long-term trials are warranted to confirm its clinical utility and sustainability.

[PMID: 40371595] Rotator cuff (RC) pathology encompasses a wide range of conditions, which include bursitis, tendinitis, tendinosis, partial thickness tears and full-thickness tears. To treat painful musculoskeletal problems, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been employed as a non-pharmacological alternative. Photobiomodulation (PBM), which uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and other photo-emitting devices, is a minimally invasive approach used to treat a wide range of conditions. The purpose of this pre-post study design is to evaluate the effectiveness of PBM and exercise-based rehabilitation on pain and functional recovery in patients with RC pathology. Twenty of the thirty-seven patients who were tested for shoulder disorders and found to have RC pathology were included in the study. The patients' pain levels were measured using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) both at baseline and 6 weeks later. The mean ± standard deviation of NPRS was calculated, data was checked for normal distribution, and the Wilcoxon rank test was conducted to compare the values. Our study showed a statistically significant reduction in pain scores from baseline (7.33 ± 0.79) to 6 weeks (2.50 ± 0.69), p < 0.001 of PBM and exercise-based rehabilitation. The knowledge about the evidence regarding the effectiveness of PBM, along with exercise-based rehabilitation, is critical.

[PMID: 39635498] Exercise therapy is the first-line treatment in rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP), and diverse types of exercise seem effective. However, it is not still clear if painful exercise should be allowed or avoided during exercises. The objective of this study was to investigate if exercise into pain is more effective than no pain in RCRSP. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a physiotherapy clinic in Belgium. Forty-three participants with chronic RCRSP were randomly allocated to G1 (exercising into pain) or G2 (exercising without pain) in a 12-week intervention with 6-month follow-up. Primary outcome was the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI); secondary outcomes were pain intensity, fear-avoidance beliefs, fear of pain, quality of life, strength, and range of motion. Outcomes were measured at baseline (T0), after 9 weeks (T1), 12 weeks (T2), and 6 months (T3) from the first session and analysed with linear mixed models. No between-group difference in SPADI (time-by-group interaction, p = 0.25) up to 6 months was found, with mean difference (G1-G2) at T1 = 5.78 (CI95%: -3.43,14.59; p = 0.33), at T2 = 0.93 (CI95%: -7.20,9.05; p = 0.82), at T3 = 4.15 (CI95%: -2.61,10.92; p = 0.33). No between-group differences were found for any other outcomes. Pain provocation seems not to be necessary in RCRSP for achieving successful treatment effect in pain and disability reduction, fear-related beliefs, and quality of life up to 6 months.

[PMID: 39189423] To evaluate the effectiveness of trigger point manual therapy (TPMT) in treating rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP). Randomized controlled trials that compared the effects of TPMT with no or other conservative treatments in patients with RCRSP were included. Primary outcomes were shoulder pain intensity and function. Secondary outcomes were pressure pain threshold (PPT) and number of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, PEDro scale and GRADE approach were employed. Ten studies were included in this systematic review and seven in the meta-analysis. Very low to low quality of evidence showed no statistically significant difference between TPMT and other conservative treatments in rest and activity pain reduction in the short term (3 days to 12 weeks), and the difference in shoulder function was statistically significant in favor of TPMT. Furthermore, TPMT was found to be effective in the improvement of PPT and the inactivation of active MTrPs in the short term. TPMT may be equally effective as other passive treatments for the pain reduction in patients with RCRSP in the short term, and slightly more effective for functional improvement. TPMT seems to be effective to treat the active MTrPs in RCRSP. CRD42023409101.

[PMID: 39121188] This study aimed to determine the clinical efficacy of Kinesiotaping (KT) combined with a rehabilitation program to reduce symptoms and functional limitations in patients with Rotator Cuff-Related Shoulder Pain (RCRSP) in Vietnam. In total, 82 participants who were diagnosed with RCRSP were randomly allocated into two groups. Both groups received a standard rehabilitation program; additionally, the intervention group was treated with KT. Outcomes, assessed at baseline, and 3, 7, and 14 days postintervention, included pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS), functional disability (Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, SPADI), and active range of motion (ROM). The KT group exhibited significant improvements in all outcome measures. VAS scores decreased by an average of 13.3 points in the KT group at 14 days, which was notably greater than that in the control group (95% CI: -17.77 to -8.82). SPADI scores also improved significantly in the KT group, with reductions of -11.36, -15.27, and -13.3 at days 3, 7, and 14, respectively. Regarding ROM, the KT group showed notable improvements in flexion and external rotation, with flexion ROM differences of 10.78, 10.35, and 11.8 degrees at the respective time points. No significant changes were observed in the abduction or internal rotation ROM. After adjusting for age, baseline scores, and gender, there was a statistically significant interaction between Group and Time on the VAS, SPADI, and ROM abduction. Incorporating KT into a standard rehabilitation program for RCRSP demonstrated enhanced efficacy in reducing pain and improving shoulder function. The results suggest that KT can be a valuable component of the treatment regimen for RCRSP.

[PMID: 38682089] To critically evaluate the effects of manual therapy (MT) on pain and functional improvement in patients with rotator cuff injury (RCI), a systematic review of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on MT for RCI was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan-fang Data, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature database from inception to March 28, 2023. A total of 1,110 participants from 24 eligible RCTs were included in the analysis. Compared with placebo, MT could not effectively relieve pain [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-0.25; 95% CI: -0.51 to 0.01; P=0.06], although its impact on functional improvement appears limited (SMD=0.20; 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.49; P=0.18). Combining MT with exercise had significant advantages over exercise alone, as combined therapy contributed to both pain reduction (SMD=0.36; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.64; P=0.01) and functional enhancement (SMD=0.32; 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.52; P=0.002). Furthermore, MT combined with multimodal physiotherapy showed additional benefits in pain reduction (mean difference=1.57; 95% CI: 0.18 to 2.96; P=0.03) and functional improvement (SMD=0.77; 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.12; P<0.0001) compared with multimodal physiotherapy alone. These findings highlight the superior pain alleviation and functional improvement provided by MT when combined with exercise or physiotherapy. Consequently, MT has emerged as a pivotal component of therapeutic intervention for RCI.

[PMID: 37959210] Rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair is crucial for functional recovery and for minimizing the risk of retear. There are two rehabilitation protocols (early and traditional) and the debate about which is the best is open. This umbrella review aimed to compare the effect of these rehabilitation protocols in terms of reduction in pain, functional recovery, and retear risk. We selected systematic reviews and meta-analyses published between 2012 and 2022 dealing with the aim. Nineteen systematic reviews were included. No significant differences were found between early and traditional protocols in terms of pain reduction. Early rehabilitation provided better short-term results regarding Range of Motion improvement, but long-term functional outcomes were similar. Retear risk remains a significant concern for the early protocol. We found major differences between the analyzed protocols. This review suggests that both protocols are useful to recover global shoulder function, but the standard protocol has a greater safety profile for larger tears. On the other hand, the early protocol may be preferable for smaller lesions, allowing a faster recovery and having less impact on medical costs. Further research is needed to identify optimal rehabilitation strategies tailored to the individual patient's needs and characteristics.

[PMID: 37490337] Chronic shoulder pain (CSP) is a common condition with various etiologies, including rotator cuff disorders, adhesive capsulitis, shoulder instability, and shoulder arthritis. It is associated with substantial disability and psychological distress, resulting in poor productivity and quality of life. Physical therapy constitutes the mainstay treatment for CSP, but several barriers exist in accessing care. In recent years, telerehabilitation has gained momentum as a potential solution to overcome such barriers. It has shown numerous benefits, including improving access and convenience, promoting patient adherence, and reducing costs. However, to date, no previous randomized controlled trial has compared fully remote digital physical therapy to in-person rehabilitation for nonoperative CSP. The aim of this study is to compare clinical outcomes between digital physical therapy and conventional in-person physical therapy in patients with CSP. We conducted a single-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial involving 82 patients with CSP referred for outpatient physical therapy. Participants were randomized into digital or conventional physical therapy (8-week interventions). The digital intervention consisted of home exercise, education, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), using a device with movement digitalization for biofeedback and asynchronous physical therapist monitoring through a cloud-based portal. The conventional group received in-person physical therapy, including exercises, manual therapy, education, and CBT. The primary outcome was the change (baseline to 8 weeks) in function and symptoms using the short-form of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures included self-reported pain, surgery intent, analgesic intake, mental health, engagement, and satisfaction. All questionnaires were delivered electronically. A total of 90 participants were randomized into digital or conventional physical therapy, with 82 receiving the allocated intervention. Both groups experienced significant improvements in function measured by the short-form of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire, with no differences between groups (-1.8, 95% CI -13.5 to 9.8; P=.75). For secondary outcomes, no differences were observed in surgery intent, analgesic intake, and mental health or worst pain. Higher reductions were observed in average and least pain in the conventional group, which, given the small effect sizes (least pain 0.15 and average pain 0.16), are unlikely to be clinically meaningful. High adherence and satisfaction were observed in both groups, with no adverse events. This study shows that fully remote digital programs can be viable care delivery models for CSP given their scalability and effectiveness, assessed through comparison with high-dosage in-person rehabilitation.

[PMID: 36868297] Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and corticosteroids are used to treat rotator cuff diseases. However, few reviews have compared the effects of these 2 treatments. In this study, we compared the effects of PRP and corticosteroid injection on the prognosis of rotator cuff diseases. According to the Cochrane Manual of Systematic Review of Interventions, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched comprehensively. Two independent authors screened suitable studies and performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Only randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of PRP and corticosteroid in the treatment of rotator cuff injuries were included, as measured by clinical function and pain during different follow-up periods. Nine studies with 469 patients were included in this review. In short-term treatment, corticosteroids were superior to PRP in the improvement of Constant, Simple Shoulder Test, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (mean difference [MD] -5.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.26, 0.06; P = .05 and MD -0.97, 95% CI -1.68, -0.07; P = .03 and MD -6.67, 95% CI -12.85, -0.49; P = .03, respectively). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups at midterm (P > .05), and the recovery of the Simple Shoulder Test and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores in PRP treatment was significantly better than that in corticosteroid treatment in the long term (MD: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.74; P < .00001 and MD: 6.96, 95% CI: 3.90, 9.61; P < .00001, respectively). In pain reduction based on visual analog scale score, corticosteroids led to better pain reduction (MD: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.64; P = .04), but no significant difference was observed in pain reduction between the 2 groups in the any term (P > .05). However, these differences did not reach the minimum clinically important difference. Current analysis showed that corticosteroids have better efficacy in short term, whereas PRP is more beneficial for long-term recovery. However, no difference was observed in the mid-term efficacy between the 2 groups. Randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up periods and larger sample sizes are also needed to determine the optimal treatment.",10
General exercise therapy is more effective than scapular stabilizer exercises in reducing pain and improving function of the shoulder.,shoulder pain AND general exercise therapy AND scapular stabilizer exercises AND functional outcomes,"36922413,32861372,41187382,41187343,41187335,41187327,41187315,41187307,41187300,41187299","[PMID: 36922413] The main aim of the trial was to assess the combined impact of graded Thera-Band strengthening exercises and scapular stabilization exercises on shoulder pain, physical function, and quality of life (QoL) in post-mastectomy adhesive capsulitis (AC). Seventy females with unilateral post-mastectomy AC partook in the trial. Participants were subdivided equally into two groups at random. Both groups obtained the traditional physical therapy program; in addition, the intervention group received graded Thera-Band exercises for shoulder muscles and scapular stabilization exercises 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Range of motion (ROM) and muscle power of shoulder were assessed by digital goniometer and handheld dynamometer, respectively. Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH) was utilized for assessment of shoulder function and visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain measurement while short-form (SF-36) for QoL assessment. All evaluation data was recorded prior to the trial and at the eighth week of interventions for both groups. All participants achieved improvements in shoulder ROM, muscle power, pain, and all aspects of QoL; however, higher statistical improvements were reported in all measurements with respect to strengthening exercises group (p < 0.001). The addition of graded Thera-Band strengthening exercises and scapular stabilization exercises in post-mastectomy AC rehabilitation program has significant benefits in shoulder function and patients' QoL. This study is retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05311839.

[PMID: 32861372] Interventions focused on the scapula should be considered in treating subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS). However, the effect of adding scapular stabilization exercises to protocols of progressive strengthening of the shoulder complex muscles on a non-multimodal approach remains unclear. To investigate the effect of adding scapular stabilization exercises, emphasizing retraction, and depression of the scapula, to a progressive periscapular strengthening protocol on disability, pain, muscle strength, and ROM in patients with SAPS. Randomized, controlled, superiority trial, prospectively registered, two-arms, parallel, blind assessor, blind patient, and allocation concealment. Sixty patients with SAPS were randomly allocated into two groups: Periscapular Strengthening (PSG) or Scapular Stabilization (SSG) exercises. The interventions were performed three times a week for eight weeks. The primary outcome function and secondary outcomes (Pain, kinesiophobia, global perceived effect, satisfaction with treatment, the range of motion, scapula position and muscle strength) were measured in the baseline, four weeks, eight weeks (end of intervention) and 16 weeks after baseline. Shoulder pain and function were assessed by the Brazilian version of the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI-Br). A total of 60 patients were included and randomized to PSG (n = 30) or SSG (n = 30) from March 2016 to June 2017. There were no between group differences in primary and secondary outcomes at any time point. The inclusion of the isolated scapular stabilization exercises, emphasizing retraction and depression of the scapula, to a progressive general periscapular strengthening protocol did not add benefits to self-reported shoulder pain and disability, muscle strength, and ROM in patients with SAPS.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187343] IntroductionMental health in children is significantly influenced by socio-economic status, poverty, and income inequality. However, existing child psychiatric research focuses on clinical variables and developed nations. Hence, this study explored the impact of these factors on the psychosocial functioning of children visiting a mental health clinic in India.MethodsA cross-sectional research design was employed, with data collected from children and their parents/caregivers using the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS). Participants included 120 children recruited from an out-patient clinic in a tertiary mental healthcare center. Non-parametric tests were employed to examine the influence of socio-economic status and poverty on functioning among the participants.ResultsOur study observed significant differences in functioning scores related to socio-economic status, monthly family income, and sources of income, with family income source significantly affecting disability scores. A significant proportion of the participants scored below the functioning benchmark and above the disability benchmark.ConclusionSocio-economic disparities and income inequality significantly influence mental health outcomes. The findings emphasize the role of social determinants of mental health and underscore the importance of integrating mental health services with socio-economic support systems.

[PMID: 41187335] DNA nanostructure-enabled functional constructs have shown potential to improve healthcare outcomes by offering advanced disease diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Translating this potential of DNA nanostructure-based constructs to real life applications relies on maintaining and enhancing the structural integrity and functions of the surface-anchored moieties. In this study, we explored the possibility of utilizing choline dihydrogen phosphate (CDHP) solution, an aqueous solution of ionic liquid, to assemble DNA nanostructures of different sizes and complexities with enhanced biostability and ligand binding affinity. We show successful formation of the DNA nanostructures in aqueous CDHP solution using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and circular dichroism (CD). Biostability assays reveal that the aqueous CDHP solution may provide passive protection to DNA nanostructures against DNase I and human serum for up to 48 h. We also demonstrate that this enhanced biostability arises both from the structural conformation imparted during CDHP-mediated folding and from the presence of free CDHP ions in the solution. Notably, removal of free ions reduced the passive protection effect, but did not eliminate it, indicating the contribution of both folding and surrounding free ions. Using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we show that the presence of aqueous CDHP solution can enhance the binding of aptamer-functionalized DNA nanostructures to specific receptors on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Our strategy of using ionic liquid solution for one-pot preparation with enhanced stability and functionality offers a robust, simpler and faster alternative for DNA nanostructure-based constructs.

[PMID: 41187327] Neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized as pain arising from lesions of the somatosensory nervous system. However, NP-like features have been found in several chronic secondary musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions in the absence of detectable lesion or damage to the somatosensory pathways. Emerging evidence has demonstrated associations between NP-like symptoms and altered neural activity within brain regions implicated in sensory perception and affective-emotional processing of pain with consistent findings of abnormal activity in the right insula (RIns) cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG-NF) is a brain-computer interface biofeedback technique that allows individuals to self-regulate the real-time cortical brain activities of the regions of interest. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of a novel EEG-NF intervention designed to simultaneously downtrain activity in the RIns and dACC in individuals with a chronic secondary MSK pain condition exhibiting NP-like features. In addition, this study will conduct secondary exploratory analyses to investigate EEG-derived neuronal changes and their associations with clinical and experimental pain outcomes following the EEG-NF training. We will design a single-arm, open-label, pilot-feasibility trial. We will recruit adults aged 35-75 years with a score of ≥19 using the PainDETECT questionnaire and an average pain score of ≥4 on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the last 3 months, with a minimum pain duration of 3 months, to receive active EEG-NF training. Participants will receive auditory feedback as a reward for achieving a predetermined activity threshold of the RIns and dACC. Primary outcomes will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and safety using both self-reported questionnaires and monitoring data. Collected data will be summarized descriptively, with mean (SD) reported where appropriate. Secondary outcomes will include EEG parameters, self-reported measures, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing. An exploratory within-group pre-post statistical comparison will be conducted for all secondary outcome measures, and correlation analysis will be performed to explore relationships between EEG measures, self-reported outcomes, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing measures. This study has received approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Participant recruitment began in April 2025 and is ongoing. As of October 2025, data collection has been completed, with a total of 5 participants enrolled, all of whom have completed the study to date. We expect to complete the study in March 2026. This study will generate data on feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary data to inform a fully powered effectiveness clinical trial. The results and data generated will inform the design and sample size calculation for a fully powered randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of EEG-NF in targeting NP-like features in individuals with chronic MSK pain.

[PMID: 41187315] We examined changes in peak and rapid force and surface electromyographic (sEMG) excitation among females using monophasic OC and females not using OC following immobilization and rehabilitation. To examine potential sex differences, a male control group was included. Ten males, 10 OC females, and 10 non-OC females (mean ± SD age = 23 ± 3 years) immobilized their left wrist/hand with a brace for one week, followed by ≥ one week of rehabilitation. Participants completed grip tests to assess peak force and the rate of force development (RFD) before and after immobilization and post-rehabilitation, with electromyographic signals recorded from the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECBR) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS). Grip force declined post-immobilization: males = -17.2 ± 10.3%, non-OC = -22.3 ± 24.7%, OC = -20.7 ± 14.8%. No significant time × group interactions were observed for any dependent variables (p > 0.05, η² ≤ 0.084). Time effects showed recovery post-rehab across all groups. RFD, particularly at 200 ms, declined posttest and rebounded post-rehab. ECBR excitation increased post-rehab; FDS excitation responses were highly variable across participants. Five participants required > one week of rehabilitation (2 males, 2 non-OC, 1 OC), suggesting rapid recovery for most. Males and females in this study exhibited similar declines and recovery in grip force after one week of wrist/hand immobilization, regardless of OC use. These findings suggest that the influence of OC use on neuromuscular outcomes in females undergoing short-term musculoskeletal rehabilitation may be minimal.

[PMID: 41187307] Vascular dysfunction contributes to Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRDs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies link midlife hemostasis and platelet aggregation measures to late-life dementia risk. We aimed to determine whether platelet aggregation in midlife is associated with imaging markers of AD pathology. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated associations between platelet aggregation, measured by light transmission aggregometry, and amyloid (<sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET uptake in dementia-free, middle-aged adults from the Framingham Heart Study. Co-primary outcomes included amyloid and tau uptake in AD-vulnerable regions. We also examined an MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk as a secondary outcome. We used multivariable regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, considering potential nonlinear associations. Platelet aggregation response was evaluated in 382 participants (mean age 56 ± 8 years, 53% female) approximately 1.2-1.5 years before amyloid and tau PET imaging. MRI data used for the AD signature were acquired together with PET imaging or within several months. The aggregation response exhibited a nonlinear association with AD pathology. Among those in the lowest tertile of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) response, platelet aggregation response was positively associated with increased amyloid in the precuneus (β = 0.047, <i>p</i> = 0.020) and tau in the rhinal (β = 0.077, <i>p</i> = 0.012), entorhinal (β = 0.066, <i>p</i> < 0.020), temporal global (β = 0.063, <i>p</i> = 0.031), and cortical (β = 0.064, <i>p</i> = 0.028) regions. For the secondary outcome analysis (n = 256), platelet aggregation response was negatively associated with the MRI-based cortical thickness signature of AD risk (β = -0.002, <i>p</i> < 0.035), consistent with a neurodegenerative pattern. Our findings indicate that platelet aggregation is linked to PET and MRI markers of AD pathology as early as midlife. These findings support further investigation of platelet-mediated mechanisms in AD pathogenesis.

[PMID: 41187300] The unicameral bone cyst (UBC) is a benign lesion that affects children and adolescents between 4 and 14 years of age. They are defined by an osteolytic cavity filled with serous fluid, enclosed by a thin fibrous membrane. Moreover, they are closely associated with skeletal growth and biomechanical stresses during development. Surgical management of UBCs is crucial, particularly in weight-bearing bones, to reduce the risk of pathological fractures and maintain structural stability. These surgical procedures (such as curretage and bone grafting) aim to restore bone stability, prevent recurrence, and enhance long-term functional outcomes. Studying UBCs provides insight into the natural history and behavior of benign bone lesions, emphasizing the importance of growth and mechanical factors in skeletal pathology. This case report seeks to present our experience in managing UBCs of the proximal femur in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, focusing on the tips needed in the surgical technique that can aid surgeons in the management of such cases.

[PMID: 41187299] To report a case series of recurrent dacryocystitis following long-term lacrimal duct intubation, and to clarify the side effects of long-term lacrimal duct intubation. This study retrospectively evaluated 24 adults (27 eyes) who presented to our center between September 2019 and December 2024 with recurrent dacryocystitis following probing and subsequent stent intubation. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical presentation, duration of intubation, stent-related complications, computer tomography image, management strategies, and prognosis. Systematically reviewed randomized controlled trial articles on lacrimal duct intubation. Several stent-related complications were identified, including: punctal granuloma (11.1%, 3/27), stent fracture (11.1%, 3/27; all three fractured stents were plastic type, with fragments adherent to granulation tissue.), punctal laceration with recurrent extrusion (3.7%, 1/27; gold stent), soft tissue false passages (47.4%, 9/19), and bony false passages (7.4%, 2/27; cases with traumatic lacrimal obstruction). Among patients undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy, functional success was 81.48% (22/27) and anatomical success was 85.19% (23/27).

Genomic sequences involved in alternative splicing responsible for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) are abundant in the ''progerinonly'' allele of Lmna knock-in models.,Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome AND alternative splicing AND progerinonly allele AND Lmna knock-in,"41187221,41187071,41186981,41186968,41186887,41186884,41186643,41186266,41186130,41186126","[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41187071] To develop a low-cost, environmentally friendly taurine fermentation method for sustainable marine fish culture using feed derived from photosynthetically produced agricultural products, it is crucial to study cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), a key enzyme in the taurine biosynthetic pathway in applicable microorganisms. In this study, a method was devised to screen for CSAD genes using <i>Escherichia coli</i> growth as an indicator, based on sulfur assimilation following the decarboxylation of l-cysteic acid, a taurine precursor compound. The <i>E. coli</i> used has a double deletion mutation of <i>cysA</i> (sulfate/thiosulfate ABC transporter) and <i>ssuD</i> (FMNH<sub>2</sub>-dependent alkanesulfonate monooxygenase) genes. If needed, an additional defect in enzyme genes, such as <i>cysC</i> (adenylyl-sulfate kinase), which participates in the pathway reducing sulfate to sulfite, is also introduced. Using this method, it was demonstrated that the glutamic acid decarboxylase gene from <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> possesses CSAD activity. The identified decarboxylase was further confirmed to act on l-cysteine sulfinic acid. Additionally, two observations made during method refinement to reduce background growth in screening are discussed: that SsuD is involved in sulfur assimilation from an unknown sulfur compound and that certain <i>mscK</i> (mechanosensitive channel) missense mutations enable external sulfate above a specific concentration to enter the cell.

[PMID: 41186981] Over 60 years ago, researchers started the genetic analysis of bacterial cell division by isolating conditional, temperature-sensitive mutants of essential <i>Escherichia coli</i> cell division genes. These early mutants were obtained by mutagenesis with chemical agents that introduced dozens to hundreds of mutations in the bacterial genomes. In this work, we present the complete genome sequences of six of these original mutants on <i>ftsA</i>, <i>ftsZ</i> and <i>ftsQ</i> genes, along with two of the strains used to generate them. The genomes of mutants obtained by exposure to nitrosoguanidine had 100 to 400 mutations. Transducing target alleles into a new strain effectively reduced the number of mutations, but those near the target gene were co-transduced with it. In contrast, a mutant generated by site-directed mutagenesis maintained the genomic background intact. The genomic analysis improves our understanding of these foundational strains, offering insights into the effects of historical mutagenesis techniques. These findings underscore the importance of genomic characterization in ensuring accurate interpretations of experimental results in microbiological research.

[PMID: 41186968] Rice cooking and eating quality (CEQ), a core agronomic trait tied to consumer preference and market value, is regulated by endosperm starch, protein, and lipid metabolism; this review synthesizes advances in its molecular mechanisms, focusing on genetic determinants and regulatory networks of storage substances. Starch is key: the Wx gene (central hub) has ≥ 9 allelic variants (e.g., Wxᵃ, Wxᵇ and Wx<sup>ela</sup>), modulating amylose content (AC) via GBSSI activity, Wx gene expression levels, splicing efficiency, etc., and exerting pleiotropic effects on protein/lipid metabolism, grain transparency, and taste; storage proteins (80% glutelin) harm CEQ by inhibiting starch gelatinisation, regulated by relevant gene families and vesicular pathways (e.g., Rab5a-VPS9a); lipids (0.3%-3% of endosperm) affect Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) profiles and aroma via genes like OsFAD, PDCT, FGC3; modules (e.g., OsNF-Ys, OsbZIP60, Ghd7-OsNAC42) balance starch-protein accumulation. Breeding strategies include marker-assisted selection, CRISPR/Cas9 editing of Wx elements or glutelin genes, gene pyramiding (Wx, ALK, GS3), and artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated intelligent breeding to boost efficiency; the review first proposes a framework: 'Wx genotype determination - amylopectin/glutelin regulation - CEQ improvement', and the establishment of this framework is rooted in the core role of the Wx gene in determining rice eating quality, which is achieved through its pleiotropic regulation of starch, protein, and lipid metabolism in the endosperm. Future directions: use Wx allelic diversity, decipher multi-omics modules (e.g., RNA methylation in starch metabolism), and integrate aroma, Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), grain shape, chalkiness, sugar transport genes to balance yield and CEQ for rice breeding.

[PMID: 41186887] This research examines how NF-κB Interacting LncRNA (NKILA) and its functional variant rs2273534 influence gastric cancer (GC) risk, development, and prognosis, along with the molecular pathways involved. 840 GC patients and 840 healthy controls participated in a case-control research. Genetic association analyses, molecular experiments (qRT-PCR, Western blot, functional assays), and bioinformatics approaches were employed. Cell-based and animal experiments were employed to validate the oncogenic role of NKILA and its regulatory axis. Carriers of the NKILA rs2273534 C allele exhibited a markedly higher susceptibility to GC (OR = 1.51, p = 0.003) and an unfavorable prognosis (HR = 1.89, p = 0.016), which was also associated with elevated NKILA expression. Elevated NKILA expression in GC tissues was associated with advanced clinicopathological characteristics. Mechanistically, NKILA promotes the expression of 5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase 2 (OAS2) through sponging miR-4424, which in turn facilitates proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in GC cells. Rescue experiments confirmed that the NKILA/miR-4424/OAS2 axis is crucial for GC malignancy. The rs2273534 SNP enhances NKILA expression and drives GC progression through the NKILA/miR-4424/OAS2 axis. Our findings highlight rs2273534 as a possible indicator for GC susceptibility and prognosis, offering insights into the oncogenic mechanisms mediated by lncRNAs.

[PMID: 41186884] Cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) molecules are immune cell surface molecules that bind and display lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of gram-negative bacteria to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), facilitating LPS-induced immune cell activation. The CD14 promoter polymorphism C-159T is positively correlated with CD14, and homozygous carriers of the T allele have a significant increase in soluble and membrane-bound CD14. To assess the C-159T polymorphism in Behcet patients compared to controls, and to study its relationship with disease manifestations and activity. Fifty-one adult Egyptian patients with Behcet's syndrome and another 51 healthy controls were recruited. Behcet's syndrome activity was assessed. A blood sample was obtained from each participant for DNA extraction. The extracted DNA was used to determine the C-159T polymorphism in the CD14 promoter gene (rs2569190) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence of the TT genotype was higher in Behcet patients (23.7%) in comparison to the controls (8%) (OR = 5.3, P value = 0.01). The prevalence of the T allele was higher in Behcet patients (49.1%) in comparison to the controls (31.4%) (OR = 2.1, P value = 0.01). The skin erythema was found to be significantly (P value = 0.003) higher in frequency among the TT genotype (58.3%) compared to the CT genotype (26.9%). Moreover, the skin pustules were found to be significantly (P value = 0.01) higher in frequency among the TT genotype (41.6%) compared to the CT genotype (11.5%). CD14 (C-159T) polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of developing Behcet's syndrome and is correlated with its dermatological manifestations. Key points • Behcet's syndrome is a variable-vessel vasculitis in which aberrant innate immunity is integral to the pathogenesis of the disease. • CD14 molecules recognize pathogens with subsequent activation of innate immunity. • The CD14 promoter gene C-159T single-nucleotide polymorphism increases the susceptibility to Behcet's syndrome. • The C-159T polymorphism correlates with skin manifestations of Behcet's syndrome.

[PMID: 41186643] Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) lacks consistent biomarkers to monitor treatment response and predict survival. Metabolically active extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying tumor-specific KRAS mutations offer promise as disease-specific biomarkers. Informed by genomic profiling of tumor tissue, plasma samples were prospectively collected from 44 patients, with confirmed KRAS-mutated PDAC, undergoing neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) followed by surgery between 2019 and 2021. Samples were obtained at diagnosis, post-NAT, and 1 month post surgery. EVs were isolated using lipid nanoprobe technology, and EV-associated KRAS mutations were detected using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Patients were grouped on the basis of temporal changes in EV-associated KRAS mutation allele frequency (MAF): no KRAS detected (ND), decreasing MAF (DD), and increasing MAF (ID). Among 44 patients, 29 (65.9%) were ND, 8 (18.2%) DD, and 7 (15.9%) ID. Detectable EV-associated KRAS MAF was found in 21%, 30%, and 50% of patients with stages I, II, and III PDAC. No significant differences were noted in demographic or clinical variables (p > 0.05). The ND group had the longest restricted mean disease-free survival (rmDFS: 31.2 months), followed by DD (27.8 months) and ID (9.8 months; p = 0.010). Similarly, restricted mean overall survival (rmOS) was longest in the ND (40.3 months), followed by DD (35.7 months) and ID (17.7 months; p = 0.012). On multivariable analysis, increasing EV-KRAS MAF (ID group) independently predicted inferior rmDFS [hazard ratio (HR): 6.14; p = 0.001] and rmOS (HR: 6.95; p = 0.002). Temporal increase of EV-KRAS MAF is a significant predictor of reduced DFS and OS in PDAC. Integrating EV-KRAS mutation allele frequency dynamics analysis with current biomarkers such as carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) could improve treatment monitoring and survival prognostication.

[PMID: 41186266] For winter wheat in the US Central Great Plains, phenotypic plasticity of yield is agronomically adaptive, i.e., genotypes with higher plasticity have higher yield in high yielding environments with no tradeoff in stressful, low yielding environments. Using data from variety trials conducted between 2000 and 2022 and cultivars released between 1991 and 2022, we explored time trends in phenotypic plasticity and heritability of yield. Given that yield plasticity is agronomically adaptive in the Great Plains, we hypothesize that i) newer cultivars will have higher yield plasticity; ii) heritability of yield is declining in the time series; and iii) genomic regions associated with yield depend on the environment and do not fully overlap with those associated with phenotypic plasticity of yield. Breeding for yield and agronomic adaptation increased phenotypic plasticity of yield at 0.5% year -1; broad sense heritability of yield decreased from 0.23 in 1993 to 0.15 in 2017. Genome-wide-association analysis shows genomic regions associated with yield varied between high yielding and stressful environments and were partially independent of those associated with yield plasticity. Newer cultivars have a higher frequency of alleles associated with yield and its plasticity. We discuss implications for breeding and agronomy aimed to improve wheat phenotypes.

[PMID: 41186130] To investigate the role of HSD3B1 germline variant (1245C) in hormone therapy outcomes in Chinese prostate cancer (PCa) patients. A multi-center observational study was conducted enrolling 785 PCa patients who received primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in China. Genotyping of germline variant and survival data were obtained, and clinical outcomes were analysed using Cox regression models. The median follow-up time was 31 months. In the entire study cohort, the HSD3B1 variant (1245C) was significantly associated with a shorter time to castration resistance after adjusting for Gleason grade group (dominant model: hazard ratio, HR = 1.62, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 1.10-2.40, p = 0.015; additive model: HR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.12-2.13, p = 0.008). Subgroup analysis (n = 438) with patients receiving only ADT for HSPC revealed a more significant association between the C allele and ADT failure (dominant model: HR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.49-3.77, p < 0.001; additive model: HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.34-2.79, p < 0.001). Among patients who received next-generation hormone therapy after ADT failure, the C allele was associated with poorer abiraterone response (HR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.07-8.50, p = 0.037); however, no significant change of response from enzalutamide was observed (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.27-3.51, p = 0.972). The HSD3B1 germline variant (1245C) is linked to earlier ADT failure and diminished efficacy of abiraterone but does not affect enzalutamide in the treatment of PCa patients. These findings underscore its potential as a biomarker to guide personalized treatment in PCa.

[PMID: 41186126] CodY acts as a key regulatory protein involved in adaptive responses in low-G+C Gram-positive bacteria. This global transcriptional regulator diagnoses the nutritional status of the cell and responds by regulating transcription of genes involved in metabolism, differenciation and virulence. Phosphoproteomic studies evidenced that CodY is phosphorylated on its serine 215 in Bacillus subtilis. In Bacillus cereus, CodY is also phosphorylated by the Hanks kinases PrkC and YbdM. CodY phosphorylation negatively affects its DNA-binding properties. We constructed B. cereus mutant strains where the codY wild-type allele has been replaced by codY-S215D or codY-S215A, encoding a phosphomimetic or a phosphoablative CodY derivative, respectively. We showed that the phosphomimetic mutation leads to a notable reduction in CodY control over several critical cellular processes, including motility, biofilm formation, cytotoxic effects and pathogenicity. Lack of CodY phosphorylation and CodY overphosphorylation have opposite repercussions on gene expression, showing that CodY phosphorylation contributes to the adaptation of B. cereus to diverse environmental conditions. S215 is strictly conserved in CodY orthologs in firmicutes, suggesting that gene regulation mediated by Hanks kinase-dependent CodY phosphorylation could be a general regulatory mechanism in this phylum.",10

The endothelial G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr124 has been reported to be required for normal forebrain angiogenesis and BBB function in mouse embryos, but the role of this receptor in adult animals is unknown. Here Gpr124 conditional knockout (CKO) in the endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity, but resulted in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic stroke and glioblastoma, accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Constitutive activation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice, with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction, pericyte coverage and extracellular-matrix deficits. We thus identify Gpr124 as an endothelial GPCR specifically required for endothelial Wnt signaling and BBB integrity under pathological conditions in adult mice. This finding implicates Gpr124 as a potential therapeutic target for human CNS disorders characterized by BBB disruption.

[PMID: 41187332] The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) compared with anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and its impact on the primary prevention of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Patients with non-valvular AF and high thromboembolic risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc > 2 points) were included. LAAO was compared against the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 11, 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-E, while statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.4.1. A total of 10 studies with 5,779 patients were analyzed (2,916 with LAAO and 2,863 with anticoagulation). LAAO reduced, though without statistical significance, the incidence of ischemic stroke (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09). However, it showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the overall anticoagulant group (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.80; p = 0.0004). LAAO emerges as a viable strategy to reduce mortality in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, particularly when long-term anticoagulation is not feasible. Its superiority over DOACs and comparable profile to VKAs, along with the absence of periodic INR monitoring and relevant drug interactions, make it an option that may optimize adherence and quality of life.

[PMID: 41187216] Many taxa have independently evolved genetic sex determination where a single gene located on a sex chromosome controls gonadal differentiation. The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex-reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the ""Four Core Genotypes"" model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.

[PMID: 41187206] Fast skeletal muscle fibers from zebrafish share a number of functional properties with mammalian twitch muscle fibers, making this vertebrate a precious model to investigate the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders. We previously reported that action potentials (APs) from zebrafish fast fibers exhibit low amplitude and require unusually strong negative resting membrane voltage levels to be elicited. In this study, using voltage-clamp and current-clamp techniques, we explored the properties of voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV) responsible for initiation and propagation of AP in isolated adult zebrafish fast skeletal muscle fibers and compared them to mouse fast-twitch muscle fibers using the same experimental conditions. We found that kinetics of activation and inactivation of NaV were faster in zebrafish fibers and, overall, that the voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted by 25 mV toward negative voltages as compared to mouse fibers, yielding a mean half-inactivation potential of -90 mV. In agreement with these findings, recording of APs at various resting membrane potentials indicated that APs vanished for resting membrane potentials less negative than -80 mV in zebrafish, whereas APs could still be elicited from resting membrane potentials as low as -60 mV in mice. In addition, Ca2+ transients induced by field stimulation were insensitive to Na+ current blockade in zebrafish but not in mouse fibers. Fluorescence labeling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors showed that zebrafish fast fibers were multi-innervated with a mean distance between extra-synaptic sarcolemma and motor endplates of 14 µm, expected to lead to negligible attenuation of depolarization propagated from endplates. Finally, knock out of the two genes encoding pore-forming NaV subunits in zebrafish muscles did not induce any change in locomotion and escape behavior of the animals. Taken together, these data question the role of NaV and the occurrence of APs in zebrafish fast muscle.

[PMID: 41187191] Severe viral and bacterial pneumonia are among the most common causes of death worldwide. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1)'s on methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)-induced severe pneumonia following cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. A young mouse model of severe pneumonia was established using Staphylococcus aureus and CMV. LTBP1 overexpression was induced, and pathological changes in lung tissue were assessed through H&E staining. Serum levels of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and interleukin (IL)-1β, were measured using ELISA. Bacterial load in the lungs was quantified, and protein expression levels of LTBP1, TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad3, and p-Smad3 in lung tissue were analyzed using Western blot. The LTBP1 expression was reduced in the young mouse model of severe pneumonia induced by Staphylococcus aureus after cytomegalovirus reactivation. Overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited lung damage, reduced serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and decreased bacterial load in the lungs. Additionally, overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. LTBP1 efficiently reduces severe pneumonia by activating the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating this condition.

[PMID: 41187159] Adolescent opioid use in the United States commands attention: millions of twelve- to nineteen-year-olds are exposed to opioids each year by prescription and misuse. Recent findings show that opioids bind not only to canonical opioid receptors but also interact with receptors on immune cells within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The potential for early life opioid exposure to give rise to long-term changes in the neuroimmune system is not fully understood, particularly given the adolescent brain's high susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that adolescent opioid use potentiates physiological and behavioral responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness later in life. To achieve this, we treated adolescent (postnatal day 35-42) male and female C57/BL6 mice with saline or bi-daily escalating doses of morphine for 5 days to model opioid dependence and, in adulthood (postnatal day 60-67), administered saline or a low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) to promote an immune response. Body weight, body surface temperature, and locomotor activity were recorded up to 48 hours after LPS administration. Mice were also tested in the forced swim test 52 hours after LPS administration to assess depressive-like behavior. In contrast to our hypotheses, we found that adolescent morphine exposure had no additive effect on low-dose LPS-induced sickness measures when assessed in adulthood. These data suggest that adolescent opioid exposure may have minimal effects on future immune challenges, although further research is needed to confirm this.

[PMID: 41187108] Sensory processing is dynamically modulated by an animal's behavior and internal states. Growing evidence suggests that such modulation starts from early stages, already at the retina, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Combining pharmacological and chemogenetic tools with single-unit extracellular recordings in awake head-fixed mice, here we identified that the visual responses of retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus were both made weaker and slower by histaminergic projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus. The observed changes in the visual responses were, however, not directly linked with histaminergic modulation of pupil dynamics or locomotion behavior. Instead, our computational modeling analysis suggests that the temporal response modulations arise from changes in the intrinsic properties of the circuit, such as gain modulation via the histamine H1 receptors in the retina. Facilitation of visual processing at low histamine levels may offer an ethological advantage, enabling animals to respond rapidly to visual threats during periods of reduced activity.

[PMID: 41187107] Emerging clinical evidence suggests a link between environmental noise and the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNcDA neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNcDA neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41187102] This study aimed to evaluate the long-term risk of stroke following dementia diagnosis and compare stroke risk across dementia subtypes using nationwide cohort data. We performed a retrospective cohort study using Korean National Health Insurance Service data (2002-2013). Patients with newly diagnosed dementia (n = 2,820) were matched 1:10 with controls (n = 28,200) by age, sex, and health screening year. Stroke incidence was evaluated over up to 10 years of follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated using Cox regression. During a mean follow-up of 2.49 years (median, 1.99; standard deviation, 2.07; IQR, 2.66), dementia was significantly associated with increased stroke risk (aHR, 3.19; 95% CI, 2.84-3.57). The highest risk was observed in patients with vascular dementia (VaD; aHR, 3.58), followed by Alzheimer's disease (AD; 2.73) and other dementias (2.61). IS was more common than HS across all subtypes. The relative risk was greater in individuals aged <60 years and in males with AD or other dementias, whereas sex differences were not evident in VaD. Dementia, especially VaD, is a strong risk factor for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. These findings support the need for dementia subtype-specific cerebrovascular risk assessment and long-term prevention strategies.

[PMID: 41187072] Inflammation is a vital response to injury or infection but can lead to diseases if chronic. Natural remedies like plant extracts present potential alternatives to synthetic drugs, offering efficacy with fewer side effects. This study explores the anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties of the aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera (AEMO) using various animal models. AEMO was evaluated in xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, wound healing, and cotton pellet granuloma models. In the carrageenan model, AEMO demonstrated significant dose-dependent reductions in paw edema (P < .001), with the 350 mg/kg dose achieving 94.4% inhibition, comparable to diclofenac. Similarly, in the cotton pellet model, AEMO significantly reduced granuloma weight at higher doses. The xylene model confirmed AEMO's efficacy, with doses of 175 mg/kg and 350 mg/kg showing reductions in ear edema comparable to diclofenac. In the wound healing model, AEMO accelerated wound closure in a dose-dependent manner, with the 60% AEMO group achieving complete healing by Day 10. Biochemical and hematological analyses showed reductions in inflammatory markers such as ALP, C-reactive protein, and WBC, supporting the anti-inflammatory potential of AEMO. These findings suggest that AEMO exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties, making it a promising natural alternative to conventional treatments like diclofenac. Further research is warranted to explore its potential clinical applications.",10

Structural equation modeling was used to better understand the relationship between structural and interpersonal power and HIV sexual risk within African American and Latina women's heterosexual dyads. The main outcome variable was women's sexual HIV risk in the dyad and was created using women's reports of condomless sex with their main male partners and partners' reports of their HIV risk behaviors. Theoretical associations developed a priori yielded a well-fitting model that explained almost a quarter of the variance in women's sexual HIV risk in main partner dyads. Women's and partner structural power were indirectly associated with women's sexual HIV risk through substance use and interpersonal power. Interpersonal power was directly associated with risk. In addition, this study found that not identifying as heterosexual was directly and indirectly associated with women's heterosexual sex risk. This study provides further support for the utility of the TGP and the relevance of gender-related power dynamics for HIV prevention among heterosexually-active women.

[PMID: 28597343] In countries with high HIV prevalence and high fertility desires, the rights of HIV-affected couples to have children are a pressing issue. Conception among people living with HIV carries risks for both horizontal and vertical HIV transmission. In Uganda ~100,000 HIV-infected women become pregnant annually. Providers face a number of challenges to preventing HIV transmission, reducing unplanned pregnancies, and ensuring safer conception. We report findings from interviews with 27 HIV-affected couples (54 individuals) in Uganda. We explored key cultural and structural factors shaping couples' childbearing decisions. Our data reveal a complex intersection of gender norms, familial expectations, relationship dynamics, and HIV stigma influencing their decisions. Participants provided insights regarding provider bias, stigma, and the gendering of reproductive healthcare. To reduce horizontal transmission HIV and family planning clinics must address men's and women's concerns regarding childbearing with specific attention to cultural and structural challenges.

[PMID: 23680303] This article explores the complex, dynamic and contextual frameworks within which men working in a mining community and their live-in long-term partners or spouses (termed ""couples"" in this study) respond to the introduction of HIV into their heterosexual relationships; the way in which partners adopt gendered positions in enabling them to make sense of their illness; how they negotiate their respective masculine and feminine roles in response to the need for HIV-related lifestyle changes; as well as the gendered nature of partner support in relation to antiretroviral therapy (ARV) adherence. We conducted an in-depth qualitative study with a sample of 12 HIV-positive seroconcordant heterosexual couples in a South African mining organization. Transcripts based on semi-structured couple's interviews were analyzed using an inductive emergent thematic analytical method. The findings present compelling evidence that the impact of HIV and AIDS is mitigated, in the main, by the nature of the dyadic relationship. Where power and agency were skewed in accordance with traditional gender scripts, the impact of HIV and AIDS was deleterious in terms of negotiating disclosure, meeting expectations of care and support, and promoting treatment adherence. As a corollary, the study also revealed that where the relational dynamic evidenced a more equitable distribution of power, the challenge of negotiating illness was embraced in a way that strengthened the couples' affiliation in profound ways, manifested not simply in a reduction in risk behaviours, but in both partner's courage to re-visit sensitive issues related to managing their relationship in the context of a debilitating illness. Gendered positioning (by self and others) was found to play a crucial role in the way couples experienced HIV and ARV treatment, and underscored the positive role of a couples-counselling approach in the negotiation of the illness experience. However, as part of a broader social project, the findings highlight the need to address the shortcomings of a public health discourse on illness normalization that reifies and reinforces skewed gender relations. In essence, the findings make a compelling case for targeting couples as the primary unit of analysis and intervention in HIV and AIDS praxis, not only to enhance treatment and prevention outcomes, but to impact on and potentially transform the lived identity of such relationships, in AIDS-affected communities. We recommend early intervention with couples in terms of couples HIV testing, risk-reduction counselling and gender-based interventions giving couples opportunities to revisit and challenge their prevailing gendered identities. We note, however, that these efforts will be undermined in the long term, if the structural drivers of HIV risk and vulnerability, contained within macro-level social, economic and cultural practices, are not simultaneously addressed.

[PMID: 11565591] This article describes the significant role of community members during the intervention development phase of a randomized clinical trial of an HIV prevention intervention for African American and Latina women and their main sexual partners. Sixteen women and 13 male partners were engaged as ""consultants"" in a series of focus group discussions aimed at exploring their reactions and ideas about potential topics and approaches for the intervention. Each individual participated in three focus groups-two single-sex groups and a third that brought women and their male partners together. Focus group data extended our knowledge about the impact of relationship dynamics on safer sex negotiation and allowed us to design an intervention that is contextually specific and pragmatic. Target community members can provide critical input during the intervention development process and should be recognized as viable and meaningful collaborators in all phases of intervention research.

[PMID: 10155880] Reproduction is a dual commitment, but so often in much of the world, it is seen as wholly the woman's responsibility. She bears the burden not only of pregnancy and childbirth but also the threats from excessive child bearing, some responsibility for contraception, infertility investigation and often undiagnosed sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including AIDS. Failure to target men in reproductive health interventions has weakened the impact of reproductive health care programmes. The paper proposes that sophisticated and dynamic strategies in Africa and elsewhere which target women's reproductive health and research (such as control of STDs including AIDS, family planning, infertility investigation) require complementary linkage to the study and education of men. Men's perceptions, as well as determinants of sexual behavioural change and the socioeconomic context in which STDs, including AIDS, become rife, should be reviewed. There is a need to study and foster change to reduce or prevent poor reproductive health outcomes; to identify behaviours which could be adversely affecting women's reproductive health. Issues of gender, identity and tolerance as expressed through sexuality and procreation need to be amplified in the context of present risks in reproductive health. Researchers and providers often ignore the social significance of men. This paper reviews the impact of male dominance, as manifested through reproductive health and sexual decisions, against the background of present reproductive health problems. A research agenda should define factors at both macro and micro levels that interact to adversely impinge on reproductive health outcomes. This should be followed up by well-developed causal models of the determinants of positive reproductive health-promoting behaviours. Behaviour specific influences in sexual partnership include the degree of interpersonal support towards prevention, for example, of STDs, unwanted pregnancy or maternal deaths. Perceived efficacy and situational variables influencing male compliance in, say, condom use, form part of the wider study that addresses men. Thus preventive reproductive health initiatives and information should move from the female alone to both sexes. Women need men as partners in reproductive health who understand the risks they might be exposed to and strategies for their prevention.

[PMID: 7802989] To determine how heterosexuals at risk for HIV infection interconnect in social networks and how such relationships affect HIV transmission. Cross-sectional study with face-to-face interviews to ascertain sociosexual connections; serologic testing. Prostitute women (n = 133), their paying (n = 129) and non-paying (n = 47) male partners; injecting drug users (n = 200) and their sex partners (n = 41). Participants were recruited in sexually transmitted disease and methadone clinics, an HIV-testing site, and through street outreach in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA. Reported behaviors, risk perceptions, sociosexual linkages, and HIV prevalence. Respondents were well informed, but reported engaging in high-risk behaviors frequently. Nevertheless, over 70% of respondents perceived themselves to be at low risk for HIV infection. The 595 respondents identified a social network of 5162 people to which they belonged. Network analytic methods indicated 147 separate connected components of this network; eight of the 19 HIV-positive individuals in the network were located in smaller components remote from the largest connected component. The isolated position of HIV-positive individuals may serve as a barrier to HIV transmission and may account for the lack of diffusion of HIV in heterosexual populations in this region. Network analysis appears useful for understanding the dynamics of disease transmission and warrants further development as a tool for intervention and control.

[PMID: 41187369] Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with limited and often toxic treatment options. This study explores the antileishmanial potential of N-substituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridine derivatives through combined in vitro and in silico approaches. Initially, N-Boc-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine (2a-i) and N-Boc-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine (1a-f) derivatives were synthesized and evaluated against Leishmania amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. infantum, and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Only N-Boc-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine derivatives with substituted nitrogen at position 6 (2b, 2c, 2f, 2g) were active (IC₅₀ < 10 μM). Based on this, a series of N-benzyl-thieno[2,3-c]pyridine analogs (3a-i) was synthesized, with compounds 3c, 3f, and 3g showing improved antipromastigote activity and selectivity índices (SI). Notably, compound 3f demonstrated potent amastigote activities (IC₅₀ between 0.83 and 1.13 μM), comparable to amphotericin B, but with a 250-fold higher SI and low in vivo toxicity (LD₅₀ = 2000 mg/kg in Zophobas morio). Physicochemical and pharmacokinetic predictions using SwissADME and Osiris indicated favorable drug-like properties and oral bioavailability for 3f. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed strong binding affinities to Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase (NDK) (PDB: 5GO1), Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) (PDB: 4WZH), and Sterol 14α-Demethylase (CYP51) (PDB: 3L4D), surpassing reference ligands, with stable complexes, key catalytic site interactions, low RMSD, compact Radius of gyration, and reduced RMSF, supporting their potential as conformationally stable and specific enzyme inhibitors for leishmaniasis treatment. Altogether, these findings strongly highlight the potential of N-substituted thieno[2,3-c]pyridine as promising scaffolds for antileishmanial drug development and highlight compound 3f as a lead candidate for further optimization.

[PMID: 41187366] The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, primarily through mechanisms involving carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Aberrant FGFR1 signalling has been implicated in various cancers, including lung, breast, neck and urothelial carcinoma. Despite the recognized oncogenic potential of FGFR1, therapeutic strategies targeting its kinase domain remain inadequately explored. This underscores an urgent need for the development of novel FGFR1 inhibitors, particularly through de novo drug design approaches, to effectively counteract FGFR1-driven malignancies. This research aims to develop novel FGFR1 inhibitors through a multi-step approach involving fragment-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and density functional theory studies (DFT), with the goal of targeting FGFR1's kinase binding domain to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Initially, known FGFR inhibitor molecules were retrieved and subjected to fragment-based drug designing and virtual screening. Through thorough analysis, molecules containing the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold were identified as promising candidates. A pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based database containing 90,952 molecules was subsequently retrieved from PubChem and filtered using molecular docking-based virtual screening resulting 94 molecules having better binding affinity than derazantinib, reference drug. After pharmacokinetic profiling (ADME), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) studies, out of 94 molecules only 11 compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and superior MM-GBSA binding free energies were selected. Docking-based screening revealed that selected 11 compounds demonstrated better binding scores than the reference drug, derazantinib. Among them, HIT1, was selected for 150ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess its conformational stability. DFT calculations further confirmed its bio-feasibility by analyzing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Overall, the selected lead compounds exhibited enhanced binding affinity, superior conformational stability, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to derazantinib. Present findings suggest that the identified hit molecules hold strong potential for inhibiting FGFR1's kinase domain and disrupting FGFR-associated tumor angiogenesis.

[PMID: 41187323] To determine the 1-year mortality in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement and its relationship with the myocardial damage extension scale. An observational, retrospective, cross-sectional, and comparative study was conducted. Patients over 18 years of age, of both sexes, who underwent aortic valve replacement between March 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021, were included. Patients were classified into subgroups based on the myocardial damage extension classification to determine 12-month mortality. In addition, risk factors associated with mortality, as well as clinical and sociodemographic variables, were documented. A total of 177 patients (104 men [59%] and 73 women [41%]) were included. Distribution among myocardial damage stages was: Stage 0 (5%), stage 1 (25%), stage 2 (56%), stage 3 (8%), and stage 4 (6%). One-year mortality was 6% (11/177), predominantly in stage 2 (72%) and stage 3 (18%). Hypertension (64%) and diabetes mellitus (55%) were the most frequent comorbidities among the deceased. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score > 2% were risk factors associated with mortality. One-year mortality was 6%, predominantly in stage 2 of myocardial damage extension. The staging did not correlate with mortality after 1 year of follow-up. An STS score > 2% and LVEF < 30% are risk factors for mortality.

[PMID: 41187270] Cold molecules provide a unique platform for exploring quantum phenomena. Using the Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage (SARP) technique, it has, for example, been demonstrated that resonances are sensitive to the initial orientation/alignment of collisional partners at low collision temperatures. In this work, we investigate the stereodynamics of the following rotationally inelastic collision process through full-dimensional quantum scattering calculations, CO (<i>v</i><sub>1</sub> = 0, <i>j</i><sub>1</sub> = 0) + H<sub>2</sub> (<i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>j</i><sub>2</sub> = 2) → CO (<i>v</i><sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> = 0, <i>j</i><sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> = 0) + H<sub>2</sub> (<i>v</i><sub>2</sub><sup>'</sup> = <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>j</i><sub>2</sub><sup>'</sup> = 0), focusing on its dependence on vibrational excitation of a collision partner (<i>v</i><sub>2</sub>). The integral cross-section is shown to be overall vibrationally adiabatic with a slight red shift of 1 cm<sup>-1</sup> per <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> for the four main resonance peaks but with irregular relative scattering amplitudes. The horizontal SARP induces completely different effects on cross-sections for one of the resonances between different vibrational states: a 92.2% suppression for <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> = 0 versus a 120.7% enhancement for <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> = 1. Our findings establish vibrational-state-selective engineering as a potential paradigm for cold collision control.",10
HbA1c consistently overestimates glycemic control in black individuals with Sickle cell trait (SCT).,HbA1c AND glycemic control AND black individuals AND sickle cell trait,"9614618,41187149,41187147,41187125,41187124,41187098,41186950,41186946,41186945,41186838","[PMID: 9614618] A number of studies, including the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), have shown that good glycemic control, as assessed by GHb measurements, can reduce the chronic complications of diabetes. The National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) was established to insure that GHb measurements by different methods were comparable and could be related to the candidate reference method used in the DCCT. The measurement of HbA1c in patients with Hb variants is one area not directly addressed by the NGSP. Therefore, we assessed the comparability of two DCCT-traceable methods in samples with Hb variants. Samples containing HbAA, HbAC, and HbAS were collected from diabetic and nondiabetic patients. HbA1c concentrations were measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography method (Bio-Rad Diamat) and an immunoassay that is suitable for use in a physician's office (Bayer DCA 2000). The two methods compared well for samples with HbAA and HbAS. However, for samples containing HbAC the immunoassay method showed relative positive biases of 8.4 and 10.4% at HbA1c levels of 7 and 9%, respectively, such that the two methods would not be judged comparable according to NGSP guidelines. The DCA 2000 HbA1c immunoassay method showed significant positive bias in patients with HbC trait. One possible clinical implication of this overestimation is overly rigorous glycemic control with a concomitant increase in hypoglycemia. This may be especially important in certain ethnic populations, such as African-Americans, who have a relatively high prevalence of HbC trait.

[PMID: 41187149] Extreme risk protection order (ERPO) laws in the United States temporarily suspend access to firearms by individuals judged to be at significant risk of harm to self or others. Evidence points toward preventive effects, but uptake of these laws remains lower than that which is likely needed to optimize their intended benefits on rates of firearm-related injury. To inform implementation efforts and policy refinements, we examined public awareness of and support for California's ERPO law, barriers to its use, and possible alternative approaches. Using a general population sample of adults from the California Safety and Wellbeing Survey (N = 3531), with both closed-ended and open-ended questions, we provide updated prevalence estimates and narrative insights about the policy, with subgroup analyses by firearm ownership status and categories of race and ethnicity. Most respondents remained unaware of the law; however, after reading a brief policy description, majorities of the population, including firearm owners and respondents across all racial-ethnic subgroups, endorsed ERPOs as appropriate and said they would be willing to serve as petitioners for family members of concern. Barriers to use included knowledge gaps, particularly among non-firearm owners and Black, Latine, and Asian respondents; not trusting the system to be fair; and the perception that the scenarios of concern involved personal or family matters. More than one-third of respondents said the police were not a preferred means through which to initiate an order and a similar proportion favored holding onto a family member's guns themselves instead of using an ERPO. Optimizing the lifesaving impacts of ERPOs will require addressing these layered concerns through coordinated and sustained investments in broader ecosystems of community safety while still facilitating firearm recovery where appropriate.

[PMID: 41187147] Mobile health (mHealth) is increasingly being used for managing chronic diseases proving its feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness in improving the health outcomes. However, effectiveness of mHealth intervention for self-management of Type 2 diabetes remains unexplored in the context of Nepal. This study aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a co-designed text based mobile health intervention for self-management of Type 2 diabetes in Nepal. We will conduct a six month, two arm (1:1) parallel group randomised control trial involving 154 adults with Type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome includes change in haemoglobin A1c level at six months follow up. Secondary outcomes include change in self-management outcomes such as self-efficacy, perceived support, diabetes related stress, health related quality of life and self-care activities. Primary and secondary outcomes will be summarized descriptively, and comparisons will be made using chi-square tests for categorical data and independent sample t-tests for continuous data. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06623006).

[PMID: 41187125] Previous reports have noted associations between infertility in women and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in later life. However, reports conflict regarding the associations between infertility and CVD risk factors. Using data from a population-based cohort of Black and White women, we examined the association between longitudinal assessments of CVD risk factors and infertility. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a prospective cohort of Black and White women who have undergone repeated assessment of CVD risk factors beginning at study baseline (1985-1986). Risk factors included cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid levels, glucose, and C-reactive protein. At approximately 40 years of age, an ancillary study assessed histories of infertility. We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link model to examine associations between infertility (dependent variable) and repeated CVD risk factors (independent variables), with adjustment for age, race, center, and education level in 1107 women. Cigarette use and higher levels of BMI, glucose, and triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) were associated with infertility after adjustment for age, race, and education. Cigarette use had the strongest associations with self-reported infertility in multivariable models (odds ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.64, 2.14). Women with infertility histories have adverse CVD risk factors across the reproductive lifespan, but cigarette use is the primary CVD risk factor for women's self-reported infertility.

[PMID: 41187124] Amid the dismantling of state structures in Haiti, the first Black republic faces significant health disparities compared to its former colonial power, France. These disparities include lower life expectancy (64.8 vs. 82.3 years) and higher infant and maternal mortality rates. The situation is further exacerbated by widespread mental health issues, severe food insecurity (50% acute vs. 37% moderate), and elevated homicide rates (13.35 vs. 1.35 per 100,000 inhabitants). As calls grow for France to return the independence ransoms extracted from Haiti, there remains limited data on how reparations could impact the country's public health, community well-being, or effective implementation of healing programs. Between Spring and Fall 2023, we conducted 4 focus groups: 1st with Haitian men and women residing in the United States, a 2nd-with men in Haiti, a 3rd with women in Cap-Haïtien and Les Cayes, and a 4th with women in Cité Soleil. We conducted focus groups structured interview protocol, comprised of open-ended questions categorized into 4 thematic sections. These questions provided insights into participants' perceptions on mental health, the daily challenges and barriers to access care, and community-based healing. Participants emphasized need for policies that address the social determinants of health, ensure safety and justice, and promote healthier workplace environments. They also advocated for mental health education aimed at reducing stigma, cultivating trust, and strengthening community support systems; with an emphasis on developing professional training, ethics, and sustainable long-term mental health services accessible for individuals of all ages. Haitian participants underscore the critical need to restore security, address the social determinants of health, and implement community-based mental health initiatives. We propose a biopsychosocial-ecological approach to guide reparations efforts. A targeted investment of $30 billion could yield substantial improvements in healthcare, mental health services, and public safety-contributing to increased life expectancy, reduced mortality rates, and decreased violence.

[PMID: 41187098] Pain, both acute and chronic, places a substantial burden on global healthcare systems. While conventional treatments may be limited in efficacy due to side effects, risk of dependency, or variable individual response, there is growing interest in mind-body complementary approaches. Yoga Nidra (YGN) has emerged as a promising non-invasive intervention for pain management. However, a clear understanding of its efficacy remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of YGN on pain outcomes. A literature search was conducted across seven databases and one trial database. Eligible studies included quantitative designs assessing the effects of YGN on pain. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials and the modified Downs and Black checklist for non-randomized studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled effect sizes. Twelve studies, comprising 1,176 participants, were included. Between-group analyses revealed that YGN significantly reduced pain compared to passive comparators (Hedge's g: -2.05, p=0.01), while comparisons with active comparators (g: -0.31, p= 0.53) showed no statistically significant differences. Within-group analyses indicated significant pain reduction following YGN (g: -2.01, p<0.001). Subgroup comparisons of single versus multiple training sessions, as well as meta-regression analyses, revealed no significant dose-response relationship across intervention durations. YGN shows potential in reducing pain intensity compared to passive control conditions, with notable within-group improvements following intervention. However, given the low methodological quality across the included studies, these effects should be interpreted cautiously, as the observed effects may represent inflated estimates. Despite these limitations, YGN demonstrates potential as a complementary approach for pain management, underscoring the need for high-quality, standardized research to establish its efficacy as a viable clinical intervention.

[PMID: 41186950] The choice of first line hormonal therapy in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) is often based on comorbidities or physician preference due to the lack of data comparing abiraterone and enzalutamide in clinical trials and in clinical practice settings, especially in African American patients. To compare clinical outcomes in patients with mHSPC treated with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. This cohort study included all patients with mHSPC diagnoses in the US Veterans Affairs Health Care system who initiated abiraterone or enzalutamide between July 2017 and April 2023. Data were analyzed from April 2024 to March 2025. Receipt of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. Drug outcomes were established by estimating rates of tumor growth (g-rates) using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values while receiving therapy and measuring overall survival (OS). Two different matching analyses were performed: inverse probability weighting (IPW) and 1:1 exact matching. A total of 1258 patients (median [IQR] age, 73 [69-79] years; 314 [25.0%] African American, 857 [68.1%] White, and 87 [6.9%] with other or unknown race) who received abiraterone and 311 patients (median [IQR] age, 74 [69-79] years; 84 [27.0%] African American, 207 [66.6%] White, and 20 [6.4%] with other or unknown race) who received enzalutamide were included. In the unweighted analysis, the abiraterone cohort had median (IQR) g-rate of 0.000137/d (0.000094-0.001519) and the enzalutamide cohort, 0.000137/d (0.000098-0.001815); median (IQR) OS was 36.2 (32.8-38.8) months for abiraterone and 36.2 (34.1-40.5) months for enzalutamide, with a median (IQR) follow-up of 28.7 (15.6-45.6) and 30.8 (16.1-39.1) months, respectively. In IPW analysis, using abiraterone as reference, the weighted median OS was comparable between abiraterone and enzalutamide in the full cohort (36.2; 95% CI, 32.8-38.8 vs 35.5; 95 % CI, 32.9-40.4 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92-1.30; P = .32), African American veterans (39.7; 95% CI, 34.3-46.6 vs 40.3; 95% CI, 34.3-not reached months; HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.72-1.34; P = .90) and those with cardiovascular disease (31.5; 95% CI, 28.1-35.5 vs 35.0; 95% CI, 30.7-38.9; HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.91-1.37; P = .30). In 1:1 matched analysis, both the abiraterone and enzalutamide groups had 279 patients with 63 (23%) who were African American; these patients had a median (IQR) follow-up of 27.3 (15.3-40.8) and 31.1 (16.8-39.9) months, respectively. The 1:1 matched cohort consisted of 158 patients (57%) in each group with an initial Gleason score of 8 or higher, and 224 patients (80%) in each group with a PSA value of 50 ng/mL or higher at treatment initiation. For the 1:1 matched cohort and its subgroups of African American patients, patients with Gleason scores of 8 or higher, and patients with a starting PSA level of 50 ng/mL or higher, no statistically significant difference in median g-rate and OS was observed. This cohort study found that abiraterone and enzalutamide had comparable outcomes in a first-line mHSPC setting, with similar g-rates and OS in both White and African American patients. There were no differences in survival or g-rate between treatment based on race, comorbidities, and prostate cancer features, including Gleason score, PSA, and volume of disease.

[PMID: 41186946] There are disparities in blood pressure (BP) levels by race in the US. To estimate the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and deaths that could be prevented among non-Hispanic Black adults by achieving the same mean systolic BP (SBP) as non-Hispanic White adults 45 years or older. In this modeling study, the difference in mean SBP between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White US adults was calculated from the 2015-2020 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The 10-year cumulative incidence of CVD, including stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure, and CVD mortality for non-Hispanic Black adults were calculated using data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. The relative risk reduction for CVD events and mortality with initiation and intensification of antihypertensive medication treatment was applied from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration (BPLTTC), calibrated to reflect the SBP reduction for non-Hispanic Black adults to have the same SBP as non-Hispanic White adults. Data were analyzed from June 22, 2022, to August 13, 2025. Systolic blood pressure. Number of CVD events and deaths. Using data from NHANES, REGARDS, and BPLTCC, the cumulative incidence of CVD events and deaths expected over the next 10 years with current SBP levels and with SBP equity was estimated. Among 82.3 million US adults included in the study, 37.2 million (45.3%) were men, 45.0 million (54.7%) were women, 10.1 million (12.2%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 72.2 million (87.8%) were non-Hispanic White. The mean (SD) age was 60.8 (0.3) years. The mean SBP was 130.7 (95% CI, 129.0-132.5) mm Hg among non-Hispanic Black adults and 124.2 (95% CI, 123.1-125.3) mm Hg among non-Hispanic White adults for those not taking antihypertensive medication (difference, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.5-8.5] mm Hg), and 137.8 (95% CI, 135.8-139.8) mm Hg among non-Hispanic Black adults and 131.2 (95% CI, 129.7-132.7) mm Hg among non-Hispanic White adults for those taking antihypertensive medication (difference, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.0-9.1] mm Hg). Achieving equity in SBP between non-Hispanic Black and White adults was projected to reduce the number of CVD events during 10 years by 50 434 (95% CI, 33 985-71 137) among non-Hispanic Black US adults not taking antihypertensive medication and 122 881 (95% CI, 83 220-176 826) among non-Hispanic Black adults taking antihypertensive medication. Achieving equity in SBP between non-Hispanic Black and White adults was projected to reduce the number of CVD deaths during 10 years by 21 703 (95% CI, 7313-40 278) among non-Hispanic Black US adults not taking antihypertensive medication and 55 055 (95% CI, 19 823-99 693) among non-Hispanic Black adults taking antihypertensive medication. The largest proportion of CVD events and deaths prevented were among those aged 45 to 64 years. For example, more than half of CVD events prevented among non-Hispanic Black adults not taking antihypertensive medication (55%) were in that age group. The findings of this modeling study suggest that achieving SBP equity between non-Hispanic Black and White adults could substantially reduce the number of CVD events and deaths experienced by non-Hispanic Black US adults. Initiatives to maintain normal BP and achieve BP control for individuals with hypertension could have a substantial impact on health equity in the US.

[PMID: 41186945] Advance care planning (ACP) engagement is poorly understood among people with serious illness. Determine whether diagnosis of and worries about serious illness are associated with ACP engagement. This cross-sectional study was based on a nationally representative survey administered April to May 2021 online or by telephone. Eligible participants were adults and English or Spanish language. Data were analyzed May 2023 to February 2025). Having a serious illness. Three domains of ACP engagement: discussion with people close to participants, discussion with clinicians, and documentation in writing. Barriers to ACP documentation and worries about serious illness were also assessed. Survey responses were weighted to reflect the US Census population. χ2 tests and multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for covariables to assess associations between serious illness and each ACP outcome. Among 1854 participants (468 [weighted percentage, 25.2%] aged 65 years or older; 955 women [weighted percentage, 51.9%]; 193 Black [weighted percentage, 12.0%], 288 Hispanic [weighted percentage, 16.7%], 1218 White [weighted percentage, 61.2%]), 367 (weighted percentage, 20%) had serious illness. Overall, 1254 (weighted percentage, 65.9%) had engaged in ACP (283 of 367 [weighted percentage, 76.5%] serious illness vs 971 of 1487 [weighted percentage, 62.6%] without serious illness; P < .001); 1071 (weighted percentage, 55.3%) discussed ACP with people close to them, 462 (weighted percentage, 22.5%) discussed with clinicians, and 650 (weighted percentage, 32.8%) documented a surrogate. People with serious illness had higher odds than those without having discussed choices for surrogates and medical wishes with people close to them (aOR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.19-2.07] and 1.66 [95% CI, 1.26-2.19]) and with clinicians (aOR, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.63-2.88] and 2.22 [95% CI, 1.67-2.94]). Serious illness status was not associated with ACP documentation. The most common barriers to documentation were not having thought about it (489 of 1171 [weighted percentage, 43.1%]) and assuming surrogates would know what they want (369 of 1171 [weighted percentage, 32.2%]). Participants who were worried (vs not worried) about being able to afford care, surrogates making the best or right decisions, having access to the best treatments, or having high stress or symptoms had significantly higher rates of ACP engagement. In this survey study of adults in the US, we found that ACP discussions with someone close to them were high, yet discussions with clinicians and documentation were low, even among people with serious illness. Our findings offer insights into how people's worries about serious illness care may affect their engagement in ACP, and how to leverage these insights to tailor patient-facing messaging about ACP.

[PMID: 41186838] Justice-involved individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) face heightened relapse risks during the reentry period. While medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are effective, long-term recovery also depends on psychological and structural supports, including situational confidence (perceived ability to resist substance use in high-risk situations) and recovery capital (the internal and external resources that support recovery). This cross-sectional study examined situational confidence and its association with recovery capital among 107 justice-involved adults receiving MOUD in an urban jail in Texas. Participants completed the Brief Situational Confidence Questionnaire (BSCQ) and the 10-item Brief Assessment of Recovery Capital (BARC-10). Mental health and substance use were assessed using the PHQ-9, GAD-7, AUDIT, and ASSIST. Bivariate associations were examined using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess factors associated with high situational confidence (BSCQ ≥ 80%). Participants had a mean age of 38.9 years (SD = 0.4); most were male (74.0%), non-Hispanic Black or other race/ethnicity (58.0%), and had a high school education or less (59.8%). A majority (66.4%) reported unstable housing in the 30 days prior to incarceration. Fewer than half (44.9%) reported high situational confidence, with a mean score of 67.6 (SD = 26.9). Higher recovery capital was strongly associated with high situational confidence (aOR = 2.66; 95% CI: 1.52-4.96). Depression (aOR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16-0.78), sexual minority status (aOR = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.01-0.78), and reliance on informal income-generating activities (""hustling"") (aOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10-1.01) were associated with lower situational confidence. Recovery capital is a strong predictor of situational confidence among justice-involved individuals receiving MOUD. Interventions that enhance recovery capital, including access to employment, housing, and social support, integrate mental health care, and provide tailored support for marginalized subgroups, may improve recovery outcomes during incarceration and reentry. Brief, validated tools like the BSCQ and BARC-10 may help identify individuals at greater relapse risk and guide more targeted, equity-informed reentry planning.",10

This review consolidates findings from the available literature and illustrates the relationships between inflammation, neurohormonal activation, metabolic derangements, and comorbidities in HF, with a focus on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed®, Wiley Online Library, Scopus, and Web of Science (limited to 2025). The search terms included ""heart failure"", ""HFpEF"", ""inflammation"", ""smoldering inflammation"", ""biomarkers"", ""cytokines"", ""fibrosis"", and ""comorbidities"". Peer-reviewed articles, reviews, as well as clinical and observational studies describing the mechanistic, prognostic and therapeutic aspects of SI in HF were included. Studies limited to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were excluded.Structural changes leading to hemodynamic perturbations in HFpEF are correlated with processes mediated by SI. Several biomarkers measure inflammation and provide diagnostic and prognostic value, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2), galectin-3 (Gal-3), and iron homeostasis. Clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and other targeted interventions in the modulation of SI.Smoldering inflammation is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of HFpEF and the progression of comorbidities. Understanding SI may improve risk stratification and management strategies. Both established and emerging anti-inflammatory therapies, when administered alone or in combination, may target SI in order to enhance HF management.

[PMID: 41174219] In the software development, high impact on diverse industries are expanding at a fast pace. Early defect fixation and adjustment according to needs are essential to increase the performance, accuracy, durability and reliability of the software. Machine Learning (ML) approaches have used to analyze the Software Requirement (SR) in software development offer a great way to accelerate symmetric development and defect correction, especially because software failures are unpredictable. This research utilizes classification and regression-based models like Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Adaptive Moment Estimation (AME) to forecast bug resolving times from applicable asymmetric data attributes. ML models are used to predict defect resolution and feature completion time. The data takes into consideration several stages including issue detection, testing, and validation. The outcome of ML models, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm has an accuracy of 66% but the proposed approach of RF, ANN, and ADE illustrates an astonishing 98% accuracy. The dataset with symmetric attributes has trends and strong correlations. The proposed model result is better than other available software failure time prediction in terms of precision and accuracy, providing a sound to defect solution and prediction in SR.

[PMID: 41158235] Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Dysregulated small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have recently been demonstrated to participate in cancer activity through their influence on cellular transformation and carcinogenesis. Specifically, <i>SNORD93</i> exhibits consistent dysregulation across multiple malignancies and demonstrates significant correlation with adverse clinical outcomes, but it remains unclear how <i>SNORD93</i> is involved in the development of CRC. In this study, we examined the role of <i>SNORD93</i> in CRC pathogenesis in order to provide novel diagnostic and treatment targets for CRC. The expression levels of <i>SNORD93</i> were quantified in CRC tissue samples (n=13) and paired adjacent normal tissue samples (n=13) from the same patients, as well as in human CRC cell lines (HT-29, SW480, and HCT-15) and the normal human intestinal epithelial crypt cell (HIEC) line via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The biological significance of <i>SNORD93</i> in the proliferation, migration, cell cycle progression, and cell apoptosis was examined through gain-of-function analyses via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, and flow cytometry. Additionally, the expression of related proteins was quantified through Western blotting (WB). A significant downregulation of <i>SNORD93</i> was identified in CRC tissues and cells. Moreover, downregulation of <i>SNORD93</i> was significantly associated with the poor survival of patients with CRC. In contrast, the overexpression of <i>SNORD93</i> suppressed the growth of CRC cells in vitro but did not affect CRC cell migration. In terms of mechanism, <i>SNORD93</i> inhibited cellular proliferation by arresting cells at the G1/S transition phase, while simultaneously inducing apoptosis. Moreover, <i>SNORD93</i> overexpression correlated with elevated phosphorylation of both receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), suggesting potential involvement of necroptosis pathways. Collectively, these results establish <i>SNORD93</i> as a functionally significant tumor-suppressive snoRNA in CRC.

[PMID: 41157542] Demodulating Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals in complex wireless environments remains a fundamental challenge, especially when traditional receiver designs rely on explicit channel estimation under adverse conditions such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or carrier frequency offset (CFO). Motivated by practical challenges in decoding DroneID-a proprietary OFDM-like signaling format used by DJI drones with a nonstandard frame structure-we present TranSIC-Net, a Transformer-based end-to-end neural network that unifies channel estimation and symbol detection within a single architecture. Unlike conventional methods that treat these steps separately, TranSIC-Net implicitly learns channel dynamics from pilot patterns and exploits the attention mechanism to capture inter-subcarrier correlations. While initially developed to tackle the unique structure of DroneID, the model demonstrates strong generalizability: with minimal adaptation, it can be applied to a wide range of OFDM systems. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic OFDM waveforms and real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) signals show that TranSIC-Net consistently outperforms least-squares plus zero-forcing (LS+ZF) and leading deep learning baselines such as ProEsNet in terms of bit error rate (BER), estimation accuracy, and robustness-highlighting its effectiveness and flexibility in practical wireless communication scenarios.

[PMID: 41151274] Given the importance of environmental sustainability, energy security risk in ensuring stable energy supply, minimizing business risks and costs, and supporting long-term investment and sustainable growth, and the examination of the energy security risk and financial development in terms of strategic business aspect is crucial in academic literature. For this, the current study establishes the quantile-dependent association between business development indicators and the environmental sustainability in broader sense. Precisely, this study investigates the role of energy security risk (ESR) and its four sub-indices, with diverse measures of firm's financial performance in the United States from 1970 to 2020. The novel Wavelet Quantile Correlation (WQC) methodology is selected to obtain the study results. The outcomes of the wavelet quantile correlations expose the non-linear behavior of the variables chosen, acknowledging the method's utility. Regarding the connectedness of financial development with energy security risk indices, the overall results reveal that the various indicators of banking sector are positively associated while majority stock market indicators negatively correlates with the energy security risk at various bearish and bullish market conditions in the short and medium run. With the geopolitical risk, the banking sector is negatively affected, while stock market variables possess an escalating impact. Various indicators of banking sector are negatively correlated with economic risk, while stock market is positively tied with economic risk. Similarly, the reliability risk is negatively secured to the quantile association with the most of the banking sector indicators. Also, the environmental risk has an increasing negative impact on banking sector indicators at various bearish, stable, and bullish quantiles, specifically in the short and long run. For robustness, the Quantile-on-Quantile Regression (QQR) analysis has been performed to validate the outcomes. In light of the outcomes, policies regarding the enhancement of business strategy development and eliminating the impact of environmental risks in developed countries like the USA have been furnished.

[PMID: 41150816] Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with long-term disturbances in stress regulation, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress and reduced psychological coping capacity. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between selected neurobiological biomarkers (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1-IGF-1; Caspase-9-CASP-9; Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase-nNOS; and Interleukin-10-IL-10) and coping styles evaluated using the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) questionnaire in men with trauma experience. Particular emphasis was placed on analyzing the effect of PTSD chronicity (≤5 years vs. >5 years) on these relationships. The study included 92 adult men with a history of life-threatening situations. Participants were divided into three groups: PTSD within the past ≤5 years (<i>n</i> = 33), PTSD within the past >5 years (<i>n</i> = 31), and a No PTSD group (<i>n</i> = 28). Biomarkers were measured in blood serum. Coping strategies were assessed using the Brief-COPE questionnaire, which includes four subscales: task-oriented, emotion-oriented, avoidant, and general coping. Due to the lack of normal distribution, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post hoc test were used. Correlations between biomarkers and Brief-COPE subscales were calculated using Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (Rho). Significant differences between groups were found in all four biomarkers (<i>p</i> < 0.001). IGF-1 and IL-10 reached the highest values in the No PTSD group and the lowest in the PTSD ≤ 5 years group, indicating neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory deficits in PTSD. Conversely, CASP-9 and nNOS levels (markers of apoptosis and oxidative stress) were highest in PTSD ≤ 5 years, with partial normalization in the PTSD > 5 years group. In terms of coping strategies, the No PTSD group displayed a highly adaptive profile (task-oriented: 30/32; emotion-oriented: 43/48; and avoidant: 12/32). Individuals with PTSD ≤ 5 years presented a maladaptive pattern (task-oriented: 13/32; avoidant: 26/32; and emotion-oriented: 27/48), while in PTSD > 5 years, a further decline in emotion-oriented (21/48) and general coping (59/112) was observed, suggesting progressive depletion of psychological resources. The strongest correlations between biomarkers and coping strategies occurred in PTSD groups. Low IGF-1 levels in PTSD ≤ 5 years correlated negatively with emotion-oriented coping (Rho = -0.39) and general coping (Rho = -0.35). High CASP-9 levels were associated with reduced task-oriented coping in PTSD > 5 years (Rho = -0.29). Similar trends were observed for nNOS and IL-10, indicating a disturbance in neurobiological balance that favors persistence of PTSD symptoms. PTSD, both in its acute and chronic phases, is associated with an abnormal profile of neuroprotective, apoptotic, and inflammatory biomarkers, which correlates with impaired adaptive coping capacity. Although partial normalization of biological parameters is observed in chronic PTSD, deficits in emotion-oriented and task-oriented coping persist. The Brief-COPE questionnaire, combined with biomarker analysis, may serve as a useful clinical tool for assessing psychophysiological balance and designing early interventions. These results highlight the potential of IGF-1, CASP-9, nNOS, and IL-10 as biomarkers of stress adaptation and therapeutic targets in PTSD.

[PMID: 41118334] Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is a common disease of the urinary system. Laparoscopic pyeloplasty, especially robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty, has become the primary surgical method for the treatment of UPJO. As YouTube gradually becomes a platform for young doctors to learn surgical techniques, we intend to assess these surgical videos of traditional laparoscopic pyeloplasty and robot-assisted pyeloplasty on YouTube in terms of their educational quality. Two authors searched for ""laparoscopic pyeloplasty"", ""robot-assisted pyeloplasty"", and ""robotic pyeloplasty"" on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/) individually on March 16, 2023. We developed the LAP-VEGaS Video Assessment Tool /LAP-VEGaS-LP scale based on the LAP-VEGaS guidelines to quantify the quality of the videos. And we used JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) Benchmark Criteria to assess the reliability of the videos. SPSS 26.0 software was applied to the description of the statistics and correlation analysis. Finally, 55 videos were included. The average length of the videos was 9.30 minutes (IQR, 22.56 minutes). The mean number of subscribers was 4745 (range, 3-28,700, IQR 16684). The mean number of VPI (views per like) was defined as the percentage of the like ratio, and the ratio of the views was 2.48% (IQR, 6.79). The median JAMA score of the videos was 6 (IQR, 2). The mean LAP-VEGaS-LP score was 17.72 (SD 0.76). The video definition had a positive correlation with the number of subscribers (r=0.410, P=0.003), views ratio (r=0.431, P=0.002), and VPI (r=0.443, P=0.001). The LAP-VEGaS-LP score had a positive correlation with the number of subscribers (r=0.398, P=0.004), definition (r=0.314, P=0.026), views ratio (r=0.459, P=0.001), VPI (r=0.496, P<0.001), and the score of reliability (r=6.53, P<0.001). The educational quality of laparoscopic pyeloplasty surgical videos is concerning. A more authoritative standard is needed to guide the uploaders and improve the educational value of the videos.

[PMID: 41118020] Recent research highlights a growing link between metabolic dysregulation-particularly involving glucose and lipid metabolism-and suicidal ideation. Given the potential role that carbohydrate and fat metabolism play in suicidal ideation, it is essential to conduct a thorough examination of their joint effects. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, an innovative indicator assessing insulin resistance and overall metabolic status, shows promise in predicting mental health issues related to metabolic disorders. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between Tyg index and suicidal ideation and its influencing factors. Our study analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, covering the period from 2009 to 2018. The TyG index was derived using the equation: Ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL) / 2]. The ninth item of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 gauged ideations of suicide. Using modified multivariable logistic regression, the relationship between the TyG index and ideation of suicide was investigated in further detail. The nonlinearity was managed using smooth curve fitting, and the threshold effects of these nonlinear relationships were further investigated using a two-part linear regression model. Subgroup and interaction analyses were also performed to test the robustness of the results. Subgroup analyses were conducted by race, body mass index, and hypertensive status, while interaction terms were used to assess potential effect modification. Among the 11,551 individuals in the study, 3.55% reported experiencing suicidal ideations. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the following domains: race, degree of education, body mass index, income, diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and depressive symptoms between the groups with and without suicidal ideation. A Strong nonlinear correlation was found between suicidal ideation and an elevated TyG index; a fully adjusted model revealed a 27% increased likelihood per unit increase. In the hypertensive group, a nonlinear relationship was noted, with a threshold effect at a TyG index of 8.75. Subgroup analysis and interaction tests revealed variations in this association, particularly by race and body mass index. There was a significant positive association in obese people, but not in other groups. The study determined that an elevated TyG index may influence suicidal ideation, particularly underscoring the need for targeted interventions and routine metabolic and mental health screenings, especially in high-risk groups like obese and hypertensive individuals.

[PMID: 41111857] Background Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common health issue, particularly among women and the elderly, leading to significant morbidity and healthcare burdens. The severity of UTIs can range from uncomplicated cystitis to more severe conditions like pyelonephritis and sepsis, which may cause long-term complications such as renal scarring. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, has gained attention for its potential role in predicting UTI severity and complications. Understanding the relationship between hs-CRP levels and UTI severity could enhance patient management and treatment strategies. Objective This study aims to investigate the relationship between hs-CRP levels and UTI severity, as well as their association with clinical factors such as comorbidities, infection type, and hospital outcomes, with a focus on determining the potential of hs-CRP as a prognostic tool for UTI complications. Methodology A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at Mardan Medical Complex from December 2024 to June 2025. A total of 173 UTI patients were included. Participants were categorized into mild, moderate, and severe infection groups based on clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory results. hs-CRP levels were measured using the Roche Cobas e411 analyzer. Demographic data, comorbidities, infection type, and hospitalization details were collected. Statistical analysis, including ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and decision tree modeling, was used to assess associations between hs-CRP levels and infection severity. Results The findings of this study indicate a significant association between elevated hs-CRP levels and the severity of UTIs. The highest hs-CRP concentrations were observed in patients with severe infections, with a mean level of 26.5 mg/L. Moreover, hs-CRP levels were notably correlated with several comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Specifically, patients with hypertension exhibited a mean hs-CRP level of 24.8 mg/L, while those with diabetes had an average level of 22.6 mg/L. Among individuals with chronic kidney disease, hs-CRP levels were even higher, with a mean of 27.34 mg/L. A decision tree analysis identified distinct hs-CRP thresholds that effectively predicted the severity of infections and the likelihood of complications, such as renal scarring and nephrolithiasis. In terms of pathogen distribution, Escherichia coli was the most frequently identified pathogen, found in 54 patients (31.21%). Notably, antibiotic resistance did not have a significant impact on hs-CRP levels (p=0.972). Nevertheless, hs-CRP was confirmed as a reliable biomarker for assessing infection severity and predicting potential complications. Further analysis revealed a clear gradation in hs-CRP levels corresponding to the severity of infection. Patients with mild infections had a mean hs-CRP level of 15.2 mg/L, those with moderate infections had an average of 21.5 mg/L, and individuals with severe infections presented the highest mean hs-CRP levels of 26.5 mg/L (p<0.001). Conclusion Hs-CRP is a reliable biomarker for evaluating UTI severity and predicting complications. Its association with infection severity, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes suggests its potential in clinical decision-making.

[PMID: 41104300] Vaccine coverage for common infectious diseases such as Measles and Pertussis (also known as whooping cough) have been declining in England and Wales since 2014. Consequently, significant increases in Measles and Pertussis cases are observed in the community. To explore whether Google Trends offers a predictive utility as a health surveillance tool for Meases and Pertussis in England and Wales. Google search data related to Measles and Pertussis, including common associated symptoms, were downloaded for 52 weeks from 07/01/2023 - 07/01/2024. Measles and Pertussis case data were retrieved from the weekly Notification of Infectious Disease (NOID) reports. The associations between searching and case data were explored using a time-series analyses, including cross-correlations, Prais-Winsten regression and joinpoint analysis. Significant cross-correlations were found for Measles cases and ""measles"" searching ( <i>r=</i>.41) at a lag of -1 week. For Pertussis cases, searching for ""whooping cough"" ( <i>r</i>=.31), ""cough"" ( <i>r</i>=.39), ""100 day cough"" ( <i>r</i>.41) and ""vomiting"" ( <i>r</i>=.42) were significantly correlated at a lag of -3 to -2 weeks. In multivariable regression, ""measles"" remained significantly associated with Measles cases (β=.24, SE=.33, <i>p</i>=.02) as did ""whooping cough"" (β=.71, SE=.27, <i>p</i>=.01) and ""cough"" (β=1.99, SE=.54, <i>p</i>=.001) for pertussis. Increases in Measles and Pertussis cases follow increases in online searches for both diseases and selected respective symptoms. Further work is required to explore how GT can be used in conjunction with other health surveillance systems to monitor or even predict disease outbreaks, to better target public health interventions.",10

Matrix effect was determined by spiking the manufacturer's calibrator F simultaneously into pooled serum and aliquots of spot urine sample donated by a single volunteer. Stability was assessed without preservatives as well as 0.0032×<i>g</i> of thymol or 1 mL of 5 M hydrochloric acid. The urinary copeptin-to-creatinine ratio reference limit was derived from random spot urines collected from 120 apparently healthy volunteers who met the selection criteria. Our in-house derived urinary copeptin-to-creatinine ratio was<2.5 pmol/mmol creatinine, and there was a statistically significant difference in urinary copeptin concentration between males and females, but this was eliminated when corrected for urine creatinine. 24-h and spot urine with and without preservatives were stable for 7 days at 4-8 °C, 23-25 °C, and -20 °C. Limits of blank, limits of detection, and limit of quantitation were 1.1 pmol/L, and 1.81 pmol/L, respectively. Urine matrix does not distort the kinetics of the BRAHMS Thermo Fisher Copeptin assay and therefore could be measured with high accuracy. The clinical utility of urinary copeptin is still unknown, however, there is growing interest in this area in patient with autosomal polycystic kidney disease.

[PMID: 41187001] Atogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, is approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. This open-label, phase 1 study examined radiolabeled atogepant (<sup>14</sup>C-atogepant) metabolism, elimination, and mass balance after a single dose (50 mg, ~200 μCi) in healthy adult males. Blood, urine, and feces were collected ≤ 28 days for atogepant, metabolite, and radioactivity level measurement. Six participants were enrolled (mean age: 33.3 years; body mass index: 28.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); five completed the study (one withdrew on Day 7 for family emergency). For atogepant, median time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) was 1 h and mean terminal elimination half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub>) was 18.5 h; for total radioactivity, T<sub>max</sub> was 1.5 h and mean T<sub>1/2</sub> was 11.6 h. Unchanged atogepant was the major circulating species in plasma (mean atogepant/total radioactivity area under the curve ratio: ~0.75). In the 14 days after dosing, ~81% and ~8% of the radioactive dose were recovered in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, parent drug (unabsorbed drug, biliary excretion, and/or intestinal secretion) accounted for 42% of administered radioactivity. At least 11 metabolites were identified in feces, and each represented < 10% of administered radioactivity. In plasma, atogepant and metabolite M23 were the only radiometric peaks detected. Metabolite M23, tentatively characterized as dioxygenated methylated glucuronide of atogepant, represented ~15% of plasma radioactivity and was short-lived. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values, vital signs, or the electrocardiogram.

[PMID: 41186228] Poly(A) RNA polymerases D5 and D7 (PAPD5, PAPD7) are host factors that stabilize hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA transcripts. RO7239958, a liver-targeted locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), induces intracellular degradation of PAPD5- and PAPD7-encoding messenger RNAs (mRNAs). This first-in-human study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of RO7239958 in healthy volunteers and adults with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) receiving standard-of-care antiviral therapy. Forty healthy volunteers were randomized (4:1) to single ascending subcutaneous doses of RO7239958 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Based on a population PK model built to predict liver exposure, two parallel CHB cohorts (<i>n</i> = 8 and <i>n</i> = 7 per cohort) were randomized to two 4-weekly doses of RO7239958 (0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg) or placebo. RO7239958 plasma exposure increased more than dose-proportionally at dose levels of 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg, suggesting saturation of liver uptake. RO7239958 was generally well tolerated in healthy volunteers; transaminase elevations occurred at the highest doses, including one reversible Grade 3 elevation. The PK model indicated that doses of 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg would reduce PAPD5 and PAPD7 mRNA by 50% and 62%, respectively, with minimal liver toxicity. Consistent with predictions, RO7239958 was well-tolerated and safe in patients. At 0.4 mg/kg, the maximum reduction from baseline in serum hepatitis B surface antigen was observed on Day 43 (mean decline 0.2 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL; range 0.0-0.5 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL). While RO7239958 showed a potentially narrow therapeutic window, PAPD5 and PAPD7 remain potential therapeutic targets in HBV curative strategies.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study was registered at NCT03762681.

[PMID: 41185142] Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) allows non-invasive dynamic in vivo assessment of transport, uptake and metabolism of deuterated molecules. To date, DMI experiments in humans have involved ingestion of glucose-d<sub>2</sub> ([6,6'-<sup>2</sup>H₂]glucose), where labelling of the sixth carbon facilitates <sup>2</sup>H-label transfer to pyruvate, then to lactate (Lac) via lactate dehydrogenase, or to glutamate and glutamine (Glx) via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. There are advantages to using glucose-d<sub>7</sub> ([1,2,3,4,5,6,6'-<sup>2</sup>H₇]glucose) for DMI as this should yield larger signals from glucose and downstream metabolites, including deuterated water (HDO). Here, we evaluated DMI at 7 T following glucose-d<sub>7</sub> ingestion for monitoring glucose metabolism in the human brain. Results were compared to measurements using the same protocol but with oral glucose-d<sub>2</sub>. Fifteen healthy volunteers participated in the study, which involved initial measurements at natural abundance, followed by 90 min of acquisition after ingestion of 0.75 g/kg glucose-d<sub>7</sub> (7 participants) or glucose-d<sub>2</sub> (8 participants). A visual stimulus was applied for 10 participants. Larger <sup>2</sup>H signals were measured following glucose-d<sub>7</sub> ingestion, and whole-brain signal ratios at times of 100 to 120 min after glucose-d<sub>7</sub> or glucose-d<sub>2</sub> ingestion for HDO, Glx and lactate (with potential contamination from lipid signals) were 1.8 ± 0.3, 1.7 ± 0.3 and 1.6 ± 0.3, respectively. At natural abundance, the SNR of the HDO signal in the CSI data was 14 ± 1. For both isotopologues, the glucose signal peaked ~80 min after ingestion, while Glx, lactate + lipid and HDO signals increased throughout the measurement period. Estimated cerebral concentrations of HDO were larger for glucose-d<sub>7</sub>, but similar concentrations were found for glucose, Glx and lactate. No significant difference in signal or concentration between visually stimulated and unstimulated participants was found. These findings suggest that glucose-d<sub>7</sub> with DMI can facilitate non-invasive in vivo assessment of metabolism in the human brain, with wide applications in experimental medicine and disease.

[PMID: 41185034] Kiwifruit is widely recognized for its nutritional value and health benefits, yet reliable and objective methods for assessing kiwifruit intake in populations remain limited. This study aimed to identify urinary biomarkers of kiwifruit intake and develop an optimal biomarker panel for differentiating consumers within days. A randomized, controlled, crossover dietary intervention was conducted among 17 healthy volunteers. The intervention included four phases: run-in, single-exposure, repeat-exposure, and follow-up. Urine samples at multiple time-point and fruit samples were prepared and analyzed using untargeted metabolomics via dual-column ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Candidate biomarkers were identified through a systematic statistical strategy on kinetic profiles within 24 h, and annotated for potential fruit-derived origin through spectral matching. Machine learning algorithms were employed to establish an optimal biomarker panel for assessing kiwifruit intake under habitual diet conditions. Twenty-three urinary metabolites showed significantly elevated kinetic profiles, among which 15 were matched to compounds detected in the original fruit or in vitro digestion samples. These metabolites mainly included polyphenol-related metabolites and plant-derived amino acid derivatives. The excretion of many metabolites turned to be delayed compared to those typically observed for other fruits. For example, 2-isopropylmalic acid usually peaked in urine or blood within 6 h of consuming other fruits, but in our study urinary level at 24 h was much higher compared to 6 h. Most of the selected candidates are not specific to kiwifruit based on existing literature, such as hippuric acid. In this regard, an XGBoost algorithm-based model using 7 metabolites achieved substantial discriminative performance (accuracy = 0.88) in predicting kiwifruit intake within two days. This study identified potential biomarkers of kiwifruit and developed a prediction model that may differentiate consumers. Further validation is necessary to confirm the reliability and generalizability of our findings. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2100048279. Registered on July 5, 2021.

[PMID: 41185024] BACKGROUND: Proper recovery and a faster return to activity play an important role in injury prevention and can significantly impact performance. Also, maintaining balance and postural control are prerequisites for effective performance that can be strengthened based on proper recovery. This systematic review examined the effect of cold water immersion (CWI) on balance and postural control in healthy young adults. The study was searched from inception to early March 2025. Six databases, Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect, PEDro, and Cochrane Library, were searched, and studies published in English were selected. Experimental studies and controlled clinical trials that included at least two groups, a CWI experimental group and a control group, had to use at least traditional or no-intervention retrieval methods. The mean age of participants was 16. The Rob2 and critical appraisal scales were used to assess the risk of bias and quality of studies. 386 studies were found in the first stage of the search, and eight were included in this review. The effects of CWI on balance in healthy individuals are varied, with some studies suggesting a positive impact and others suggesting no effect. Duration and temperature play important roles, with shorter and more moderate immersions being more effective. Temporary neural responses cause short-term instability, but in the long term, they help improve stability and control. Due to the heterogeneity among studies, conducting a meta-analysis was impossible. The use of CWI can be done under different conditions, depending on the target population and their needs. Overall, its use yields more positive effects, although contradictions persist. It should be used with caution and tailored to the needs of the individual.

[PMID: 41184710] Actions are often learnt incidentally by observing other individuals. How aspects inherent to the social context in which an action is seen affect action learning remains poorly understood. Here we study the effect of a special social signal, the eye gaze of the demonstrator, on the immediate and delayed memory and execution of observed actions. In Experiment 1, healthy young adult volunteers (N = 37) watched short videos of a demonstrator performing novel actions with novel objects only once, and were tested for immediate and delayed recall of those actions through action execution. Overall, novel actions on novel objects were recalled more accurately if, during demonstration, the demonstrator had repeatedly gazed towards the participant (direct gaze) versus towards an object (control condition). Experiment 2 (N = 41) investigated the immediate and delayed recall of novel and familiar object-use actions performed on familiar objects. In this condition, which involved familiar information, direct gaze had no effect or was even detrimental for recall. These findings show that direct gaze benefits incidental learning and retention of novel information only (novel actions paired with novel objects in Experiment 1), and interferes with the retention of familiar information (familiar objects paired with familiar actions in Experiment 2). This study suggests a role of ostensive eye contact in incidentally learning new actions. At the same time, it limits its beneficial role to a specific type of learning scenario, one involving only novel (as opposed to familiar) information, unveiling the selective function of ostensive eye contact in the transmission of novel cultural behaviors.

[PMID: 41184657] Understanding gender-based foot morphological differences is critical for ergonomic footwear design. This study investigated these variations in young adults using photogrammetric and plantar pressure analysis. We analyzed 200 healthy participants (100 males, 100 females; aged 19-21 years) through digital photogrammetry and RSscan Footscan pressure mapping. Key parameters included foot length (FL), ball width (BWF), hallux valgus angle (HVd), lateral foot angle (LdF), and Clarke's Index for arch classification. Plantar pressure distribution was assessed across 10 anatomical zones. We revealed significant gender disparities: males had longer (26.6 vs. 25.2 cm) and wider feet (10.2 vs. 9.1 cm), while 75% of participants exhibited HVd (5.1°-6.3°), with no gender difference. Dynamic Clarke's Index showed 80% had high arches, correlating with lower BMI (p < 0.001). Pressure analysis highlighted higher midfoot loading (37.8-41.2 cm<sup>2</sup>) and medial forefoot pressure in HVd cases. Females predominantly wore smaller shoes (sizes 36-38), whereas 89% of males wore sizes 42-44. BMI influenced midfoot pressure (r = 0.3) and arch height, with flat arches linked to higher BMI. Foot asymmetry (38%) and HVd prevalence underscored the need for gender-specific shoe designs. It emphasize prioritizing ergonomic footwear to mitigate pressure imbalances, HVd progression, and asymmetry, particularly in high-BMI individuals. This dual-method approach provides actionable insights for biomechanical applications and footwear customization.

[PMID: 41183256] Constraining gait rhythm with a metronome has been shown to influence gait pattern in many different ways. While rhythmic cues can improve several parameters in some clinical populations, they do alter the long-range autocorrelations naturally exhibited in series of stride durations. However, transitions between walking with and without a metronome (and vice versa) have not been measured; it is therefore unclear how people adapt to such a change in task. To address this gap, a total of 21 healthy volunteers were asked to walk overground under three conditions: one unconstrained control condition, followed by two conditions in which a metronome was activated during either the first or second half of the trial to test both transitions. The long-range autocorrelations were assessed over a sliding window on the stride series to measure their evolution. Our observations were reproduced with a computational model allowing us to relate sudden changes in movement parameters to the long-range autocorrelations, which are typically measured over longer timescales. The results showed a clear transition in both conditions involving a metronome, with long-range autocorrelations of the series of stride durations gradually reduced when the metronome was turned on and recovered when it was turned off. In these two conditions, the change in long-range autocorrelations could be reproduced in the model by an instantaneous switching of the control policy associated with the presence or not of the metronome, suggesting that long-range autocorrelations emerge from a flexible control strategy that rapidly regulates timing and amplitude parameters according to task requirements.

The objective was to study the relationship between CRF and cardiometabolic health in adult Mexican Rarámuri (also known as Tarahumara), and to study cardiac health and physiological adaptations to ultradistance running in a subgroup of Rarámuri. In rural Rarámuri (n = 66) living at moderate altitude (1150-2400 m above sea level), we carried out measurements of anthropometry, hemodynamics (sitting blood pressure and heart rate), plasma glucose, electrocardiogram and echocardiography, and estimated CRF using a sub-maximal steptest. Mean age of the studied population was 36.1 (standard deviation 11.6) years. Two participants (3%) were underweight, and ~47% were overweight/obese. Hypertension was found in ~24% of the participants. Mean CRF was moderately high to moderately low at 49 and 34 mLO2/min/kg in men and women, respectively, and CRF was significantly and inversely associated with hemodynamic and biochemistry measures except for blood glucose (p < 0.05). In a sub-group of runners, three men had mildly increased relative ventricular mass (range 118-128 g/m2). We found a relatively high proportion of overweight/obesity as well as hypertension. The expected inverse relationship between CRF and cardiometabolic measurements was observed. Abnormal physiological myocardiac adaptation to ultradistance running was minimal.

[PMID: 41187302] Major adverse cardiovascular events resulting from atherosclerotic plaque instability account for a plurality of deaths worldwide despite the use of highly effective lipid lowering therapies. Over the last three decades, the role of inflammation in atherogenesis has been tested extensively. Although preclinical studies demonstrate a clear role for inflammation in atherogenesis, clinical studies using global anti-inflammatory therapies have not been as successful as hoped, encouraging the search for new therapeutic strategies. Thanks to the advent of cell-specific lineage tracing, we have begun to appreciate the multifaceted role of smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching in modulating plaque stability. Here, we review the mechanisms controlling smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching during early and late-stage pathogenesis, which may inspire future therapies to stabilize plaques.

[PMID: 41187128] The autonomic nervous system (ANS) dynamically regulates the internal environment to maintain homeostasis. The ANS exhibits some forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and plastic changes in neurotransmitter distribution, both of which may contribute to autonomic function. Dysautonomia refers to an abnormality in the function of the ANS, with an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Dysautonomia has been reported in conditions such as stress, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and premature death. In MS, the signs of dysautonomia include elevated plasma norepinephrine levels and increased arterial blood pressure. In this study, we characterized the effect of a high-sucrose diet (HSD) on synaptic plasticity in sympathetic ganglia of the rat by measuring LTP expression in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and analyzing the expression of acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA, as well as their balance of colocalization/segregation in ganglionic nerve terminals. The HSD consists of adding 30% sucrose to drinking water, which is an accepted model of MS. We observed an impairment in LTP expression, along with a decrease in ACh presence and a reduction in its segregation from GABA. These findings suggest the emergence of an inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission and plasticity within the SCG. We propose that dysautonomia associated with MS might involve changes in sympathetic activity, at least at the level of ganglionic cholinergic transmission. These results may help to improve our understanding of autonomic dysfunction in the context of this metabolic disorder.

[PMID: 41187125] Previous reports have noted associations between infertility in women and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in later life. However, reports conflict regarding the associations between infertility and CVD risk factors. Using data from a population-based cohort of Black and White women, we examined the association between longitudinal assessments of CVD risk factors and infertility. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a prospective cohort of Black and White women who have undergone repeated assessment of CVD risk factors beginning at study baseline (1985-1986). Risk factors included cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid levels, glucose, and C-reactive protein. At approximately 40 years of age, an ancillary study assessed histories of infertility. We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link model to examine associations between infertility (dependent variable) and repeated CVD risk factors (independent variables), with adjustment for age, race, center, and education level in 1107 women. Cigarette use and higher levels of BMI, glucose, and triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) were associated with infertility after adjustment for age, race, and education. Cigarette use had the strongest associations with self-reported infertility in multivariable models (odds ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.64, 2.14). Women with infertility histories have adverse CVD risk factors across the reproductive lifespan, but cigarette use is the primary CVD risk factor for women's self-reported infertility.

[PMID: 41187090] Despite favourable effects of oestradiol on cardiovascular risk factors, previous studies found higher risks of cardiovascular events in transgender women using gender-affirming hormone therapy. However, these studies did not adjust for socioeconomic status and lifestyle. This study investigated the association between gender-affirming hormone therapy and cardiovascular event risk in a large cohort of transgender persons compared with the general population, accounting for these factors. This retrospective cohort study included transgender women and transgender men using gender-affirming hormone therapy between 1972 and 2018 at the Amsterdam gender clinic. Medical diagnoses were registered from 2012 to 2022 by a national data registry. Standardized incidence ratios for myocardial infarction, ischaemic cerebrovascular accident, and venous thromboembolism were computed using general population incidence rates adjusted for socioeconomic status, estimated by education, employment, and income. Lifestyle (body mass index, smoking, and alcohol consumption) was analysed by age group. Adjusted for socioeconomic status, transgender women (N = 2714, 23 907 person-years) had lower myocardial infarction risk (.50 [.32; .71]), similar cerebrovascular accident risk (.94 [.72; 1.19]), and higher venous thromboembolism risk (1.81 [1.33; 2.35]) compared with general population men. Transgender men (N = 1617, 13 457 person-years) had higher myocardial infarction risk (4.20 [2.72; 6.01]), higher cerebrovascular accident risk (1.55 [1.01; 2.20]), and similar venous thromboembolism risk (1.00 [.53; 1.61]) compared with general population women. Socioeconomic status minimally impacted these results. Lifestyle largely resembled the general population. Gender-affirming hormone therapy is not associated with increased cardiovascular risk in transgender women but is in transgender men. This aligns with known effects of oestradiol and testosterone on cardiovascular risk factors.

[PMID: 41187001] Atogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, is approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. This open-label, phase 1 study examined radiolabeled atogepant (<sup>14</sup>C-atogepant) metabolism, elimination, and mass balance after a single dose (50 mg, ~200 μCi) in healthy adult males. Blood, urine, and feces were collected ≤ 28 days for atogepant, metabolite, and radioactivity level measurement. Six participants were enrolled (mean age: 33.3 years; body mass index: 28.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); five completed the study (one withdrew on Day 7 for family emergency). For atogepant, median time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) was 1 h and mean terminal elimination half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub>) was 18.5 h; for total radioactivity, T<sub>max</sub> was 1.5 h and mean T<sub>1/2</sub> was 11.6 h. Unchanged atogepant was the major circulating species in plasma (mean atogepant/total radioactivity area under the curve ratio: ~0.75). In the 14 days after dosing, ~81% and ~8% of the radioactive dose were recovered in feces and urine, respectively. In feces, parent drug (unabsorbed drug, biliary excretion, and/or intestinal secretion) accounted for 42% of administered radioactivity. At least 11 metabolites were identified in feces, and each represented < 10% of administered radioactivity. In plasma, atogepant and metabolite M23 were the only radiometric peaks detected. Metabolite M23, tentatively characterized as dioxygenated methylated glucuronide of atogepant, represented ~15% of plasma radioactivity and was short-lived. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values, vital signs, or the electrocardiogram.

[PMID: 41186946] There are disparities in blood pressure (BP) levels by race in the US. To estimate the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and deaths that could be prevented among non-Hispanic Black adults by achieving the same mean systolic BP (SBP) as non-Hispanic White adults 45 years or older. In this modeling study, the difference in mean SBP between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White US adults was calculated from the 2015-2020 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The 10-year cumulative incidence of CVD, including stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure, and CVD mortality for non-Hispanic Black adults were calculated using data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. The relative risk reduction for CVD events and mortality with initiation and intensification of antihypertensive medication treatment was applied from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration (BPLTTC), calibrated to reflect the SBP reduction for non-Hispanic Black adults to have the same SBP as non-Hispanic White adults. Data were analyzed from June 22, 2022, to August 13, 2025. Systolic blood pressure. Number of CVD events and deaths. Using data from NHANES, REGARDS, and BPLTCC, the cumulative incidence of CVD events and deaths expected over the next 10 years with current SBP levels and with SBP equity was estimated. Among 82.3 million US adults included in the study, 37.2 million (45.3%) were men, 45.0 million (54.7%) were women, 10.1 million (12.2%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 72.2 million (87.8%) were non-Hispanic White. The mean (SD) age was 60.8 (0.3) years. The mean SBP was 130.7 (95% CI, 129.0-132.5) mm Hg among non-Hispanic Black adults and 124.2 (95% CI, 123.1-125.3) mm Hg among non-Hispanic White adults for those not taking antihypertensive medication (difference, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.5-8.5] mm Hg), and 137.8 (95% CI, 135.8-139.8) mm Hg among non-Hispanic Black adults and 131.2 (95% CI, 129.7-132.7) mm Hg among non-Hispanic White adults for those taking antihypertensive medication (difference, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.0-9.1] mm Hg). Achieving equity in SBP between non-Hispanic Black and White adults was projected to reduce the number of CVD events during 10 years by 50 434 (95% CI, 33 985-71 137) among non-Hispanic Black US adults not taking antihypertensive medication and 122 881 (95% CI, 83 220-176 826) among non-Hispanic Black adults taking antihypertensive medication. Achieving equity in SBP between non-Hispanic Black and White adults was projected to reduce the number of CVD deaths during 10 years by 21 703 (95% CI, 7313-40 278) among non-Hispanic Black US adults not taking antihypertensive medication and 55 055 (95% CI, 19 823-99 693) among non-Hispanic Black adults taking antihypertensive medication. The largest proportion of CVD events and deaths prevented were among those aged 45 to 64 years. For example, more than half of CVD events prevented among non-Hispanic Black adults not taking antihypertensive medication (55%) were in that age group. The findings of this modeling study suggest that achieving SBP equity between non-Hispanic Black and White adults could substantially reduce the number of CVD events and deaths experienced by non-Hispanic Black US adults. Initiatives to maintain normal BP and achieve BP control for individuals with hypertension could have a substantial impact on health equity in the US.

[PMID: 41186892] High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a nuclear protein, once released to the extracellular space, participates in the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Thrombomodulin alfa (TMα), a recombinant soluble protein of endothelial thrombomodulin, prevents CIPN by promoting thrombin-dependent HMGB1 degradation and activation of protein C and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI/plasma carboxypeptidase B/CPB2). We thus investigated the downstream molecules of activated protein C (APC) and TAFI (TAFIa), for prevention of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) in mice. OIPN was prevented by TMα and by each of an anti-HMGB1-neutralizing antibody (HAb), APC and porcine pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (ppCPB, used as a stable surrogate of TAFIa), or their combination at subeffective doses. Intraplantar administration of HMGB1 induced mechanical allodynia, which was abolished by TMα, but not APC or ppCPB. The anti-OIPN effects of TMα and APC were reversed by an antagonist of proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), targetable by APC, and the effect of TMα was also reversed by a CPB inhibitor. Intraplantar administration of mouse C5a (mC5a), targetable by TAFIa, caused mechanical allodynia, an effect blocked by TMα, a mC5a receptor (mC5aR) antagonist or HAb. The mC5aR antagonist prevented OIPN development. Oxaliplatin significantly increased plasma C5a levels in the mice treated with argatroban, a thrombin inhibitor, capable of reducing the degradation of HMGB1 by the endogenous thrombin-thrombomodulin axis. Our data thus suggest that the anti-OIPN effect of TMα involves APC-induced PAR1 activation and TAFIa-induced degradation of C5a that induces HMGB1-dependent pain, in addition to HMGB1 degradation.

[PMID: 41186654] The timing of anti-hypertensive medication may influence cardiovascular outcomes and blood pressure control, yet the evidence remains inconclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the effects of bedtime versus morning dosing of anti-hypertensives on mortality, cardiovascular events, and ambulatory blood pressure. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bedtime versus morning administration of antihypertensive therapy. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to June 2025. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for categorical outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous variables. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.3.3. PROSPERO registration ID: CRD420251113957. Pooled analysis of six RCTs with 49,983 patients was included. Bedtime dosing of anti-hypertensive medications resulted in a lower incidence of heart failure (1.3% vs. 2.0%; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.85) but not myocardial infarction (1.4% vs. 1.6%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64-1.17), stroke or transient ischemic attack (0.9% vs. 1.3%; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49-1.05), all-cause mortality (2.6% vs. 3.1%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53-1.06), or cardiovascular mortality (1.0% vs. 1.5%; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.22-1.21). For blood pressure, bedtime dosing significantly reduced evening systolic blood pressure (MD - 4.71 mmHg, 95% CI - 6.64 to - 2.78) and evening diastolic blood pressure (MD - 1.66 mmHg, 95% CI - 1.92 to - 1.40), with no significant differences observed in morning readings. Bedtime administration of anti-hypertensive medications may be associated with reduction in MACE and heart failure incidence. No significant effect was observed in mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

[PMID: 41186583] There is growing evidence for the benefits of physical activity during the menopause life stage. However, limited research has explored physical activity behavior of UK women. Using a mixed-methods approach, 2 phases of research were undertaken to: (1) assess physical activity levels and examine the relationship with menopausal symptoms, and (2) use the COM-B theoretical framework to understand the influence of ""Capability, Opportunity and Motivation"" on physical activity Behavior. In phase 1, participants completed an online survey (n = 655; mean age = 49.9 y). Descriptive analyses were supplemented with χ2 tests, with Bonferroni correction. In phase 2, 4 online focus groups (n = 24; mean age = 52.7 y) were undertaken and thematically analyzed. In phase 1, 75% reported achieving 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity/week, although 57% reported activity levels had decreased during the menopause life stage. Twelve out of 14 symptoms were experienced by >50%, with changes in mood and brain fog most common (>80%). There was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the moderate to vigorous physical activity guidelines between those women who did or did not experience individual symptoms, although for 10/14 symptoms, >50% indicated a negative impact on likelihood to engage in activity. In phase 2, capability (eg, menopausal symptoms), opportunity (eg, social support), and motivation (eg, low confidence) were all influential on behavior. These findings enhance our understanding of UK women's experiences of being physically active during the menopause, and provide insight into potential intervention strategies to support women to be active at that time.",10

This study provides a single-cell transcriptomic profile of mouse immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout pregnancy and assesses the similarities and differences between these immune cells and human decidual immune cells. Homeostasis of the immune microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface is essential for pregnancy. Immune cell heterogeneity at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnant mice remains understudied. Here, we perform in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analysis with 120,238 maternal-fetal single cells of mice from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E18.5 and in vitro experiments to establish an immune cell atlas. Macrophages constitute the largest population, with some subsets resembling human counterparts, and the number of Ccr2 + macrophages in the decidua increases as pregnancy progresses. Neutrophils constitute the second largest population, and Ifit1 + N2 neutrophils are localized close to the implantation site during early pregnancy. Three NK cell subsets were identified, including the previously reported NK1.1 - subset. In combination with in vitro experiments, the presence of T and B cells within the decidua was validated. Our work profiles a comprehensive immune cell atlas of the mouse maternal-fetal interface, offering a valuable reference for further investigations.

[PMID: 41184605] Clinical observations of patients with congenital heart disease carrying SMAD2 genetic variants revealed correlations with multi-organ impairments at the developmental and functional levels. Many patients with congenital heart disease present with glomerulosclerosis, periglomerular fibrosis and albuminuria. It remains largely unknown whether SMAD2 variants associated with congenital heart disease can directly alter kidney cell fate, tissue patterning and organ-level function. Here we investigate the role of pathogenic SMAD2 variants in podocytogenesis, nephrogenic cell lineage specification and glomerular filtration barrier function using a combination of CRISPR-based disease modelling, stem cell and microfluidic organ-on-a-chip technologies. We show that the abrogation of SMAD2 results in altered patterning of the mesoderm and intermediate mesoderm cell lineages, which give rise to nearly all kidney cell types. Following further differentiation of intermediate mesoderm cells, the mutant podocytes failed to develop arborizations and interdigitations. A reconstituted glomerulus-on-a-chip system showed substantial albumin leakage, as observed in glomerulopathies. This study implicates chronic heart disease-associated SMAD2 mutations in kidney tissue malformation that might inform targeted regenerative therapies.

[PMID: 41180383] Heart failure and cardiovascular disease are the primary causes of mortality in patients with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), resulting from mutations in the LMNA gene. In this study, we investigated a familial pedigree of HGPS to derive induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells using a nonintegrating Sendai virus method from both affected and unaffected family members. The goal was to create a comprehensive robust and reliable cellar model to study the accelerated aging disease's progression. The resulting iPSCs fulfilled all pluripotency criteria, demonstrated differentiation into all three germ layers, and retained the HGPS mutation. In addition, these iPSCs exhibited key HGPS characteristics, such as shortened telomeres, abnormal Lamin A (Progerin) expression, and reduced cardiac marker levels. Thus, our approach offers a robust, reliable, and accurate representation of the disease pathology for the aging community.

[PMID: 41177513] The excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in cardiac tissue increases myocardial stiffness, contributing to diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmia risk. While this clinical association is established, the underlying electromechanical mechanisms remain elusive. Using human and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes cultured on tunable 3D PDMS substrates replicating infarcted rat heart decellularized ECM (dECM) stiffness, we systematically investigated how ECM-mediated mechanical changes alter action potentials and sodium current dynamics, as well as Nav1.5 expression. 3D PDMS substrates were fabricated with stiffness values spanning the mechanical range of infarcted rat heart dECM (Young's modulus: ∼20-400 kPa; elastic modulus: ∼5-30 pN/nm). Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (15-day culture), neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (3-day culture) and human embryonic kidney 293 (24-h culture) cells stably expressing human Nav1.5 were cultured on the these PDMS substrates. Stiffness-dependent cellular electrophysiological effects were assessed using patch-clamp recordings. The gene and protein level changes were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immune blot. We found that evaluated substrate stiffness levels progressively reduced the AP upstroke slope, resulted in proarrhythmic AP morphologies characterized by increased AP instability and triangulation. Electrophysiological analysis revealed this mechanical modulation occurred through distinct sodium channel kinetic alterations: (1) a significant rightward-shifted voltage-dependent activation curve, and (2) a faster transition from a closed state to inactivation occurred, while maintaining unchanged current density, steady-state inactivation properties, and recovery time across stiffness conditions. This effect may arise from a conformation change in Nav1.5, since the expression and distribution of Nav1.5 has not altered across three PDMS groups. In summary, substrate stiffening impaired cardiomyocyte depolarization and promoted conduction abnormalities via Nav1.5 dysfunction, suggesting a mechanoelectrical mechanism in ECM deposition related arrhythmogenesis.

[PMID: 41176539] Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is associated with intricate changes that can eventually lead to heart failure. Galangin is a natural flavonoid derived from the rhizome of the galangal plant that has shown protective effects against a variety of cardiomyopathies. Galangin undergoes methylation at the third hydroxyl position to form Galangin 3-methyl ether (G3-ME), thus increasing its lipophilicity, thereby facilitating its cellular entry and regulatory effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of G3-ME on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the underlying mechanisms. Two established transgenic mouse models of HCM, i.e., Myh6<sup>R404Q</sup> and Tnnt2<sup>R109Q</sup> mice, were used for in vivo studies. For in vitro experiments, H9c2, a rat cardiomyocyte cell line, along with human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs), were exposed to angiotensin II (Ang II, 1 μM). We showed that G3-ME (2.5-20 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the expression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy marker genes Nppa and Nppb in Ang II-treated H9c2 cells. G3-ME (5 μM) effectively mitigated the Ang II-induced expansion of H9c2 cells and hESC-CMs. In the two HCM mouse models, administration of G3-ME (20 or 50 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.) for 4 weeks significantly improved the cardiac hypertrophy phenotype. By conducting RNA sequencing combined with network pharmacology, we identified histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) as the direct target of G3-ME in H9c2 cells. We demonstrated that G3-ME inhibited both the phosphorylation of HDAC2 and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway during the cardiac hypertrophy process in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of HDAC2 resulted in inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy, whereas its overexpression facilitated cardiac hypertrophy through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, G3-ME attenuates pathological cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro by targeting HDAC2, leading to the inactivation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. G3-ME may serve as a promising option for addressing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

[PMID: 41173008] Generation of in vitro human induced pluripotent cell (hiPSC)-derived skeletal muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs) holds great promise for regenerative medicine for skeletal muscle wasting diseases, for example Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). While multiple approaches have been described to obtain SMPCs in vitro, hiPSC-derived SMPCs generated using transgene-free protocols are usually obtained in a low amount and resemble a more embryonal/fetal stage of differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway during an in vitro skeletal muscle differentiation protocol increases the yield of PAX7<sup>+</sup> and CD54<sup>+</sup> human SMPCs (hSMPCs) and drives them to a higher maturation stage, in both human embryonic stem (ES) and patient-derived induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). Importantly, the obtained SMPCs are able to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes in vitro and engraft in vivo. These findings reveal that modulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic avenue to generate SMPCs in vitro with potential for cell therapy approaches.

[PMID: 41173005] In early blastocyst, inner cell mass (ICM) undergoes a second wave of lineage commitment to generate epiblast (Epi) and primitive endoderm (PrE), restricting the developmental potential of their progeny. However, the epigenetic mechanism underlying this lineage segregation remains unclear. Here, we reveal that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibition with EPZ-6438 transdifferentiates murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into primitive endoderm stem cells (PrESCs). Genetic ablation of Ezh2 in ESCs reduces the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) deposition at the promoters of PrE-specific genes, derepressing their expression and facilitating the PrESC conversion. Reconstitution with wild-type EZH2, but not catalytically inactive or EED-binding-deficient mutants in EZH2-deficient ESCs, blocks this transition. Strikingly, EZH2 inhibition reduces epiblast cell numbers in blastocysts, with 45.9% of embryos exhibiting ICMs composed of no SOX2-positive cells. Furthermore, EPZ-6438 treatment in human naive ESCs upregulates hypoblast-associated genes. In sum, these results reveal an evolutionarily conserved role for EZH2-polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in safeguarding pluripotency from primitive endoderm cell fate.

[PMID: 41171815] Although small animal models of Fanconi anemia (FA) are useful, they do not faithfully replicate many of the clinical features seen in FA patients. We reasoned that a porcine model of FA with its similar physiology and a relatively long lifespan would produce a phenotype more similar to human FA. Targeting FANCA in domestic swine resulted in skeletal abnormalities and extreme sensitivity to interstrand DNA cross-linking agents. In addition, FANCA disruption followed by mitomycin C treatment resulted in a > 10-fold increase in chromosomal radials, a finding that is considered diagnostic for human FA. Bone marrow derived, hematopoietic progenitor cells from a FANCA null pig showed a 75% reduction in colony forming activity compared to wild type. Evaluation of steady state hematopoiesis in the peripheral blood revealed the gradual development of red cell macrocytosis and a reduction in circulating neutrophils. Targeting of FANCD2 failed to produce any biallelic animals demonstrating the loss of FANCD2 function is embryonic lethal in pigs. These results indicate that a porcine model of FANCA holds promise for the development of strategies to prevent the development of bone marrow failure and malignancies in patients with FA.

[PMID: 41167193] Transposable elements (TEs) occupy nearly half of the genome and drive developmental innovation, yet the mechanisms of silencing long terminal repeats (LTRs) remain incompletely understood. We demonstrate that methyltransferase-like 3 deficiency reverts naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to a totipotent-like state with reactivation and chromatin resetting of 8C-associated genes, eRNAs, and LTRs, particularly ERV1 and ERVL-MaLR. Moreover, m<sup>6</sup>A on primate-specific L1PA is found to be essential. Mechanistically, L1PA binds 8C-associated LTRs and eRNAs and regulates chromatin through RNA-scaffold complexes with chromatin regulators, where m<sup>6</sup>A directs protein-binding preference. In naive hESCs, m<sup>6</sup>A on L1PA suppresses EP300 binding to ERV1 and enhances KAP1 binding to ERVL-MaLR, thereby restricting LTR activity. In parallel, the m<sup>6</sup>A-L1PA axis or m<sup>6</sup>A on eRNAs limits EP300/H3K27ac occupancy at 8C enhancers. Our findings reveal a conserved mechanism in which humans and mice employ species-specific long interspersed nuclear element-1 subfamilies with m<sup>6</sup>A to regulate LTR activity, underscoring the crucial role of transposons in RNA-chromatin crosstalk during cell fate transitions.",10
Hypocretin neurones suppress panicprone state in rats.,hypocretin neurons AND orexin AND panic behavior AND rat model,"28649201,25583879,22453138,41187381,41187128,41187072,41186973,41186870,41186827,41186824","[PMID: 28649201] Orexin neurons originating in the perifornical and lateral hypothalamic area are highly reactive to anxiogenic stimuli and have strong projections to anxiety and panic-associated circuitry. Recent studies support a role for the orexin system and in particular the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) in coordinating an integrative stress response. However, no selective OX1R antagonist has been systematically tested in two preclinical models of using panicogenic stimuli that induce panic attack in the majority of people with panic disorder, namely an acute hypercapnia-panic provocation model and a model involving chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis in the perifornical hypothalamic area followed by intravenous sodium lactate infusion. Here we report on a novel brain penetrant, selective and high affinity OX1R antagonist JNJ-54717793 (1S,2R,4R)-7-([(3-fluoro-2-pyrimidin-2-ylphenyl)carbonyl]-<i>N</i>-[5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazin-2-yl]-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-amine). JNJ-54717793 is a high affinity/potent OX1R antagonist and has an excellent selectivity profile including 50 fold versus the OX2R. <i>Ex vivo</i> receptor binding studies demonstrated that after oral administration JNJ-54717793 crossed the blood brain barrier and occupied OX1Rs in the rat brain. While JNJ-54717793 had minimal effect on spontaneous sleep in rats and in wild-type mice, its administration in OX2R knockout mice, selectively promoted rapid eye movement sleep, demonstrating target engagement and specific OX1R blockade. JNJ-54717793 attenuated CO<sub>2</sub> and sodium lactate induced panic-like behaviors and cardiovascular responses without altering baseline locomotor or autonomic activity. These data confirm that selective OX1R antagonism may represent a novel approach of treating anxiety disorders, with no apparent sedative effects.

[PMID: 25583879] Orexins (OXs) are peptides produced by perifornical (PeF) and lateral hypothalamic neurons that exert a prominent role in arousal-related processes, including stress. A critical role for the orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) in complex emotional behavior is emerging, such as overactivation of the OX1R pathway being associated with panic or anxiety states. Here we characterize a brain-penetrant, selective, and high-affinity OX1R antagonist, compound 56 [N-({3-[(3-ethoxy-6-methylpyridin-2-yl)carbonyl]-3-azabicyclo[4.1.0]hept-4-yl}methyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-2-amine]. Ex vivo receptor binding studies demonstrated that, after subcutaneous administration, compound 56 crossed the blood-brain barrier and occupied OX1Rs in the rat brain at lower doses than standard OX1R antagonists GSK-1059865 [5-bromo-N-({1-[(3-fluoro-2-methoxyphenyl)carbonyl]-5-methylpiperidin-2-yl}methyl)pyridin-2-amine], SB-334867 [1-(2-methyl-1,3-benzoxazol-6-yl)-3-(1,5-naphthyridin-4-yl)urea], and SB-408124 [1-(6,8-difluoro-2-methylquinolin-4-yl)-3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]urea]. Although compound 56 did not alter spontaneous sleep in rats and in wild-type mice, its administration in orexin-2 receptor knockout mice selectively promoted rapid eye movement sleep, demonstrating target engagement and specific OX1R blockade. In a rat model of psychological stress induced by cage exchange, the OX1R antagonist prevented the prolongation of sleep onset without affecting sleep duration. In a rat model of panic vulnerability (involving disinhibition of the PeF OX region) to threatening internal state changes (i.e., intravenous sodium lactate infusion), compound 56 attenuated sodium lactate-induced panic-like behaviors and cardiovascular responses without altering baseline locomotor or autonomic activity. In conclusion, OX1R antagonism represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders associated with stress or hyperarousal states.

[PMID: 22453138] Acute hypercapnia (elevated arterial CO(2)/H(+)) is a suffocation signal that is life threatening and rapidly mobilizes adaptive changes in breathing and behavioral arousal in order to restore acid-base homeostasis. Severe hypercapnia, seen in respiratory disorders (eg, asthma or bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), also results in high anxiety and autonomic activation. Recent evidence has demonstrated that wake-promoting hypothalamic orexin (ORX: also known as hypocretin) neurons are highly sensitive to local changes in CO(2)/H(+), and mice lacking prepro-ORX have blunted respiratory responses to hypercapnia. Furthermore, in a recent clinical study, ORX-A, which crosses blood-brain barrier easily, was dramatically increased in the plasma of patients with COPD and hypercapnic respiratory failure. This is consistent with a rodent model of COPD where chronic exposure to cigarette smoke led to a threefold increase in hypothalamic ORX-A expression. In the present study, we determined the role of ORX in the anxiety-like behavior and cardiorespiratory responses to acute exposure to a threshold panic challenge (ie, 20% CO(2)/normoxic gas). Exposing conscious rats to such hypercapnic, but not atmospheric air, resulted in respiratory, pressor, and bradycardic responses, as well as anxiety-like behavior and increased cellular c-Fos responses in ORX neurons. Systemically, pre-treating rats with a centrally active ORX1 receptor antagonist (30 mg/kg SB334867) attenuated hypercapnic gas-induced pressor and anxiety responses, without altering the robust bradycardia response, and only attenuated breathing responses at offset of the CO(2) challenge. Our results show that the ORX system has an important role in anxiety and sympathetic mobilization during hypercapnia. Furthermore, ORX1 receptor antagonists may be a therapeutic option rapidly treating increased anxiety and sympathetic drive seen during panic attacks and in hypercapnic states such as COPD.

[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187128] The autonomic nervous system (ANS) dynamically regulates the internal environment to maintain homeostasis. The ANS exhibits some forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and plastic changes in neurotransmitter distribution, both of which may contribute to autonomic function. Dysautonomia refers to an abnormality in the function of the ANS, with an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Dysautonomia has been reported in conditions such as stress, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and premature death. In MS, the signs of dysautonomia include elevated plasma norepinephrine levels and increased arterial blood pressure. In this study, we characterized the effect of a high-sucrose diet (HSD) on synaptic plasticity in sympathetic ganglia of the rat by measuring LTP expression in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and analyzing the expression of acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA, as well as their balance of colocalization/segregation in ganglionic nerve terminals. The HSD consists of adding 30% sucrose to drinking water, which is an accepted model of MS. We observed an impairment in LTP expression, along with a decrease in ACh presence and a reduction in its segregation from GABA. These findings suggest the emergence of an inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission and plasticity within the SCG. We propose that dysautonomia associated with MS might involve changes in sympathetic activity, at least at the level of ganglionic cholinergic transmission. These results may help to improve our understanding of autonomic dysfunction in the context of this metabolic disorder.

[PMID: 41187072] Inflammation is a vital response to injury or infection but can lead to diseases if chronic. Natural remedies like plant extracts present potential alternatives to synthetic drugs, offering efficacy with fewer side effects. This study explores the anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties of the aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera (AEMO) using various animal models. AEMO was evaluated in xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, wound healing, and cotton pellet granuloma models. In the carrageenan model, AEMO demonstrated significant dose-dependent reductions in paw edema (P < .001), with the 350 mg/kg dose achieving 94.4% inhibition, comparable to diclofenac. Similarly, in the cotton pellet model, AEMO significantly reduced granuloma weight at higher doses. The xylene model confirmed AEMO's efficacy, with doses of 175 mg/kg and 350 mg/kg showing reductions in ear edema comparable to diclofenac. In the wound healing model, AEMO accelerated wound closure in a dose-dependent manner, with the 60% AEMO group achieving complete healing by Day 10. Biochemical and hematological analyses showed reductions in inflammatory markers such as ALP, C-reactive protein, and WBC, supporting the anti-inflammatory potential of AEMO. These findings suggest that AEMO exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties, making it a promising natural alternative to conventional treatments like diclofenac. Further research is warranted to explore its potential clinical applications.

[PMID: 41186973] Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in MRI, yet concerns about gadolinium ion release, tissue retention, rare adverse events, and environmental persistence have encouraged the search for alternatives. Prior work on plant-based extracts has been largely confined to gastrointestinal luminal imaging, with limited exploration in extraluminal organs as contrast agents. To preclinically investigate the potentials of Betanin and beetroot-derived Betanin-based contrast agents (BBCA) in vitro and in vivo via oral, intravenous, and intraperitoneal administration, and to compare them with gadobutrol (a GBCA). Prospective preclinical experimental study. In vitro studies on human and mouse fibroblast cell lines, and in vivo tests involving male Wistar albino rats (n = 15) and male New Zealand albino rabbits (n = 2). 3 T, spin echo, and gradient echo sequences. Betanin and BBCA compositions were characterized by mass spectrometry. Safety was assessed by in silico modeling, cytotoxicity, flow cytometry, histology, and blood biochemistry tests. Images of phantom solutions were used to characterize the paramagnetic features via MR relaxation times and relaxivities. In vivo contrast behavior in organs was evaluated following oral, intraperitoneal, and intravenous administrations. The quantitative data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 9.0; p value < 0.05 was significant. Betanin had greater molecular binding efficiency and therapeutic capacity. BBCA was less cytotoxic than gadobutrol. Some elements in BBCA were present in larger amounts than Betanin. T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> decreased with an increase in BBCA concentration, and r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub> were estimated as 0.0014 and 0.0224 mmol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Both agents demonstrated contrast enhancements not only in the gastrointestinal lumen but also in the parenchymal organ, as well as in the vascular structure, with lower toxicity and antioxidative benefits. In particular, the enhancement in the liver was noteworthy. Betanin and BBCA may be considered as viable options for contrast-enhanced abdominal MRI.

[PMID: 41186870] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) seriously threatens the lives of preterm infants. The absence of animal models that can simulate its progression from early hyperoxic lung injury to late hypoxic vascular remodeling has hindered related research. To establish a neonatal rat BPD-PH model by simulating exposure to sequential hyperoxic hypoxia experienced by human preterm infants. Newborn SD rats were randomized into two control groups (C1 exposed to 21% O₂ for 2 weeks; C2 exposed to 21% O₂ for 3 weeks), and three exposure groups (H1 exposed to 75% O₂ for 2 weeks; H2 exposed to 75% O₂ for 2 weeks and then to 10% O₂ for a week; H3 exposed to 75% O₂ for 2 weeks and then to normoxia for a week). Cardiopulmonary parameters were evaluated by echocardiography, right ventricular systolic pressure measurement, histology, and α-SMA immunofluorescence. H1 and H2 groups exhibited distinct phenotypes, with those in the H2 group showing more severe phenotypes. The H2 group exhibited a 142% increase in RVSP relative to those in the C2 group. The right-heart index (RI) was 0.43 ± 0.01 in the H2 group, 0.36 ± 0.02 in the H3 group, and 0.22 ± 0.03 in the C2 group. Pulmonary vascular remodeling was significantly increased in the H2 group compared to the control and H3 groups. The H2 group uniquely replicated the disease process, with alveolar simplification preceding hypoxia-induced vascular thickening. The sequential hyperoxic hypoxia model dynamically mimicked the clinical progression of BPD-PH, which may provide a powerful platform for stage-specific mechanism research and development of novel therapeutic strategies.

[PMID: 41186827] We performed a comparative analysis of lipid and cholesterol metabolism disorders, as well as liver condition in male Wistar rats receiving high-fat diets with different cholesterol contents. Addition of 2% cholesterol to the diet resulted in a marked aggravation of fatty liver disease, characterized by extreme accumulation of fat and cholesterol. A diet supplemented with 0.5% cholesterol resulted in serum cholesterol accumulation and liver steatosis, but had no effect on weight gain or body composition. Introduction of 1% cholesterol to the diet induced similar abnormalities as 2% cholesterol, but without the extreme cholesterol and fat accumulation in the liver. This model can be used in the future to evaluate the effectiveness of the studied functional foods.

[PMID: 41186824] The sizes of intracerebral high-grade gliomas 101.8 and C6 in Wistar and Long-Evans rats and their relationship with survival were determined; changes in the thickness of the cerebral cortex were evaluated and morphological features of glioma models were studied. Median glioma volumes measured on MRI of brain slices in Wistar rats with glioblastoma 101.8 and glioma C6 were 169 (148-252) mm<sup>3</sup> and 114 (47-154) mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively; in Long-Evans rats with glioma C6, the median volume of the tumor was 159 (85-223) mm<sup>3</sup> without significant differences. The mean survival time of Wistar rats with glioblastoma 101.8 and glioma C6 were 16 ± 1 (SE = 0.3) days and 33 ± 6 (SE = 2) days; in Long-Evans rats with glioma C6, the mean survival time was 30 ± 2 (SE = 4) days. Survival in rats with glioblastoma 101.8 was significantly lower than in animals with C6 glioma. A negative correlation of tumor size and survival was revealed in Wistar and Long-Evans rats with glioma C6: r = -0.80 (p = 0.006) and r = -0.70 (p = 0.03), respectively. The mean thickness of the cortex of the contralateral hemisphere in tumor-bearing rats was significantly lower than in sham-operated animals. Glioma models vary in the growth rate. At the late stages of 101.8 and C6 gliomas, the thickness of the cerebral cortex of the contralateral hemisphere decreases. The volume of C6 glioma can be used as a predictor of Wistar and Long-Evans rat survival.",10
Hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission is unrelated to energy balance.,hypothalamic glutamate AND neurotransmission AND energy balance AND regulation,"37507231,35501599,34654752,33441043,32719118,30390285,30310864,27871072,26370162,25716862","[PMID: 37507231] The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a functionally heterogeneous nucleus critical for systemic energy, glucose, and lipid balance. We showed previously that the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) plays essential roles regulating excitatory and inhibitory transmission in SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons of the VMH and facilitating glucose and lipid homeostasis in female mice. Although mGluR5 is also highly expressed in VMH astrocytes in the mature brain, its role there influencing central metabolic circuits is unknown. In contrast to the glucose intolerance observed only in female mice lacking mGluR5 in VMH SF1 neurons, selective depletion of mGluR5 in VMH astrocytes enhanced glucose tolerance without affecting food intake or body weight in both adult female and male mice. The improved glucose tolerance was associated with elevated glucose-stimulated insulin release. Astrocytic mGluR5 male and female mutants also exhibited reduced adipocyte size and increased sympathetic tone in gonadal white adipose tissue. Diminished excitatory drive and synaptic inputs onto VMH Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP<sup>+</sup>) neurons and reduced activity of these cells during acute hyperglycemia underlie the observed changes in glycemic control. These studies reveal an essential role of astrocytic mGluR5 in the VMH regulating the excitatory drive onto PACAP<sup>+</sup> neurons and activity of these cells facilitating glucose homeostasis in male and female mice.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal circuits within the VMH play chief roles in the regulation of whole-body metabolic homeostasis. It remains unclear how astrocytes influence neurotransmission in this region to facilitate energy and glucose balance control. Here, we explored the role of the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, using a mouse model with selective depletion of mGluR5 from VMH astrocytes. We show that astrocytic mGluR5 critically regulates the excitatory drive and activity of PACAP-expressing neurons in the VMH to control glucose homeostasis in both female and male mice. Furthermore, mGluR5 in VMH astrocytes influences adipocyte size and sympathetic tone in white adipose tissue. These studies provide novel insight toward the importance of hypothalamic astrocytes participating in central circuits regulating peripheral metabolism.

[PMID: 35501599] Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for maintaining energy and glucose balance within the central nervous system. Because the study of its metabolic actions has been limited to effects in neuronal cells, its role in other cell types within the brain remains poorly understood. Here we show that astrocytic BDNF signaling within the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) modulates neuronal activity in response to changes in energy status. This occurs via the truncated TrkB.T1 receptor. Accordingly, either fasting or central BDNF depletion enhances astrocytic synaptic glutamate clearance, thereby decreasing neuronal activity in mice. Notably, selective depletion of TrkB.T1 in VMH astrocytes blunts the effects of energy status on excitatory transmission, as well as on responses to leptin, glucose and lipids. These effects are driven by increased astrocytic invasion of excitatory synapses, enhanced glutamate reuptake and decreased neuronal activity. We thus identify BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in VMH astrocytes as an essential mechanism that participates in energy and glucose homeostasis.

[PMID: 34654752] Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are essential for reproduction, but their role in the control of energy balance and other homeostatic functions remains unclear. High-frequency firing of hypothalamic arcuate Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons releases kisspeptin into the median eminence, and neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin onto neighboring Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to generate a slow EPSP mediated by TRPC5 channels that entrains intermittent, synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. High-frequency optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also releases glutamate to excite the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and inhibit the orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons via metabotropic glutamate receptors. At the molecular level, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is critically involved in the regulation of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and neuronal excitability through its interaction with plasma membrane (PM) calcium (e.g., TRPC) channels. Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons would increase neuronal excitability and their synchronous firing, which ultimately would affect energy homeostasis. Using optogenetics in combination with whole-cell recording and GCaMP6 imaging in slices, we discovered that deletion of <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1 neurons significantly increased the amplitude and duration of the slow EPSP and augmented synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i oscillations in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Deletion of <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons amplified the actions of NKB and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD). Therefore, STIM1 appears to play a critical role in regulating synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, which ultimately affects the coordination between energy homeostasis and reproduction.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons are essential for stimulating the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and maintaining fertility. However, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons appear to be a key player in coordinating energy balance with reproduction. The regulation of calcium channels and hence calcium signaling is critically dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) calcium channels. We have conditionally deleted <i>Stim1</i> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and found that it significantly increased the excitability of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD).

[PMID: 33441043] To maintain metabolic homeostasis, motivated behaviors are driven by neuronal circuits that process information encoding the animal's energy state. Such circuits likely include ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) glutamatergic neurons that project throughout the brain to drive food intake and energy expenditure. Targets of VMH glutamatergic neurons include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus that, when activated, inhibit food intake. Although an energy-state-sensitive, glutamate circuit between the VMH and POMC neurons has been previously indicated, the significance and details of this circuit have not been fully elucidated. Thus, the goal of the present work was to add to the understanding of this circuit. Using a knockout strategy, the data show that the VMH glutamate→POMC neuron circuit is important for the inhibition of food intake. Conditional deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT2) in the VMH results in increased bodyweight and increased food intake following a fast in both male and female mice. Additionally, the targeted blunting of glutamate release from the VMH resulted in an ∼32% reduction in excitatory inputs to POMC cells, suggesting that this circuit may respond to changes in energy state to affect POMC activity. Indeed, we found that glutamate release is increased at VMH-to-POMC synapses during feeding and POMC AMPA receptors switch from a calcium-permeable state to a calcium-impermeable state during fasting. Collectively, these data indicate that there is an energy-balance-sensitive VMH-to-POMC circuit conveying excitatory neuromodulation onto POMC cells at both pre- and postsynaptic levels, which may contribute to maintaining appropriate food intake and body mass.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Despite decades of research, the neurocircuitry underlying metabolic homeostasis remains incompletely understood. Specifically, the roles of amino acid transmitters, particularly glutamate, have received less attention than hormonal signals. Here, we characterize an energy-state-sensitive glutamate circuit from the ventromedial hypothalamus to anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that responds to changes in energy state at both sides of the synapse, providing novel information about how variations in metabolic state affect excitatory drive onto POMC cells.

[PMID: 32719118] The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) plays chief roles regulating energy and glucose homeostasis and is sexually dimorphic. We discovered that expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) in the VMH is regulated by caloric status in normal mice and reduced in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mutants, which are severely obese and have diminished glucose balance control. These findings led us to investigate whether mGluR5 might act downstream of BDNF to critically regulate VMH neuronal activity and metabolic function. We found that mGluR5 depletion in VMH SF1 neurons did not affect energy balance regulation. However, it significantly impaired insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, lipid metabolism, and sympathetic output in females but not in males. These sex-specific deficits are linked to reductions in intrinsic excitability and firing rate of SF1 neurons. Abnormal excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly and elevated expression of the GABAergic synthetic enzyme GAD67 also cooperate to decrease and potentiate the synaptic excitatory and inhibitory tone onto mutant SF1 neurons, respectively. Notably, these alterations arise from disrupted functional interactions of mGluR5 with estrogen receptors that switch the normally positive effects of estrogen on SF1 neuronal activity and glucose balance control to paradoxical and detrimental. The collective data inform an essential central mechanism regulating metabolic function in females and underlying the protective effects of estrogen against metabolic disease.

[PMID: 30390285] Neurons in the brain, particularly those in the hypothalamus, are essential for the maintenance of whole-body metabolic homeostasis. Dysfunctions or dysregulations of them can result in various metabolic diseases, including eating disorders, obesity, and diabetes. In addition to hormonal and peptidergic regulation, accumulating evidence has shown that these neurons are subject to synaptic regulation, which has been largely overlooked. In this chapter, we focus on synaptic neurotransmission of hypothalamic neurons and summarize current knowledge of synaptic plasticity in the maintenance of energy balance. Synaptic modulation engaged by circulating hormones is also discussed.

[PMID: 30310864] Energy balance is regulated by anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. POMC neurons make extensive projections and are thought to release both amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters. However, whether they communicate directly with NPY/AgRP neurons is debated. Initially, using single-cell RT-PCR, we determined that mouse POMC<sup>eGFP</sup> neurons express <i>Slc17a6</i> (<i>Vglut2</i>) and <i>Slc18a2</i> (<i>Vmat2</i>), but not <i>Slc31a1</i> (<i>Vgat</i>) mRNA, suggesting glutamate and non-canonical GABA release. Quantitative (q)RT-PCR of POMC<sup>eGFP</sup> cells revealed that <i>Vglut2</i> and <i>Vmat2</i> expression was significantly increased in E2- versus oil-treated, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Since 17β-estradiol (E2) is anorexigenic, we hypothesized that an underlying mechanism is enhancement of POMC signaling. Therefore, we optogenetically stimulated POMC neurons in hypothalamic slices to examine evoked release of neurotransmitters onto NPY/AgRP neurons. Using brief light pulses, we primarily observed glutamatergic currents and, based on the paired pulse ratio (PPR), determined that release probability was higher in E2- versus oil-treated, OVX female, congruent with increased <i>Vlgut2</i> expression. Moreover, bath perfusion of the Gq-coupled membrane estrogen receptor (ER) agonist STX recapitulated the effects of E2 treatment. In addition, high-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation generated a slow outward current that reversed near E<sub>k+</sub> and was antagonized by naloxone, indicative of β-endorphin release. Furthermore, individual NPY/AgRP neurons were found to express <i>Oprm1</i>, the transcript for μ-opioid receptor, and DAMGO, a selective agonist, elicited an outward current. Therefore, POMC excitability and neurotransmission are enhanced by E2, which would facilitate decreased food consumption through marked inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons.

[PMID: 27871072] Testosterone exerts profound effects on reproduction and energy homeostasis. Like other orexigenic hormones, it increases endocannabinoid tone within the hypothalamic feeding circuitry. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that testosterone upregulates the expression of diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL)α in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) to increase energy intake via enhanced endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde inhibition of anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Energy intake, meal patterns, and energy expenditure were evaluated in orchidectomized, male guinea pigs treated subcutaneously with testosterone propionate (TP; 400 μg) or its sesame oil vehicle (0.1 mL). TP rapidly increased energy intake, meal size, O2 consumption, CO2 production, and metabolic heat production, all of which were antagonized by prior administration of the DAGL inhibitor orlistat (3 μg) into the third ventricle. These orlistat-sensitive, TP-induced increases in energy intake and expenditure were temporally associated with a significant elevation in ARC DAGLα expression. Electrophysiological recordings in hypothalamic slices revealed that TP potentiated depolarization-induced suppression of excitatory glutamatergic input onto identified ARC POMC neurons, which was also abolished by orlistat (3 μM), the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (1 μM), and the AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor compound C (30 μM) and simulated by transient bath application of the dihydrotestosterone mimetic Cl-4AS-1 (100 nM) and testosterone-conjugated bovine serum albumin (100 nM). Thus, testosterone boosts DAGLα expression to augment retrograde, presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release onto ARC POMC neurons that, in turn, increases energy intake and expenditure. These studies advance our understanding of how androgens work within the hypothalamic feeding circuitry to affect changes in energy balance.

[PMID: 26370162] The strength of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory synaptic input is a principle determinant of neuronal activity. However, because of differences in the number of GABA afferent inputs and the sites of synapses, it is difficult to directly assay for altered GABA transmission between specific cells. The present study tested the hypothesis that the level of mRNA for the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) can provide a reliable proxy for GABA release. This was tested in a mouse hypothalamic circuit important in the regulation of energy balance. Fluorescent in situ hybridization results show that the expression of Gad1 mRNA (encoding the GAD67 enzyme) was increased in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons after an overnight fast, consistent with the ability of GABA from these neurons to stimulate food intake. Optogenetic studies confirmed that the observed increase in Gad1 mRNA correlated with an increase in the probability of GABA release from NPY/AgRP neurons onto downstream proopiomelanocortin neurons. Likewise, there was an increase in the readily releasable pool of GABA in NPY/AgRP neurons. Selective inhibition of GAD activity in NPY/AgRP neurons decreased GABA release, indicating that GAD67 activity, which is largely dictated by expression level, is a key determinant of GABA release. Altogether, it appears that Gad expression may be a reliable proxy of altered GABAergic transmission. Examining changes in Gad mRNA as a proxy for GABA release may be particularly helpful when the downstream targets are not known or when limited tools exist for detecting GABA release at a particular synapse.

[PMID: 25716862] Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) regulates vital physiological functions, including energy balance and sleep. MCH cells are thought to be GABAergic, releasing GABA to inhibit downstream targets. However, there is little experimental support for this paradigm. To better understand the synaptic mechanisms of mouse MCH neurons, we performed neuroanatomical mapping and characterization followed by optogenetics to test their functional connectivity at downstream targets. Synaptophysin-mediated projection mapping showed that the lateral septal nucleus (LS) contained the densest accumulation of MCH nerve terminals. We then expressed channel rhodopsin-2 in MCH neurons and photostimulated MCH projections to determine their effect on LS activity. Photostimulation of MCH projections evoked a monosynaptic glutamate release in the LS. Interestingly, this led to a feedforward inhibition that depressed LS firing by a robust secondary GABA release. This study presents a circuit analysis between MCH and LS neurons and confirms their functional connection via monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways. Our findings indicate that MCH neurons are not exclusively GABAergic and reveal a glutamate-mediated, feedforward mechanism that inhibits LS cells.",10
"IFI16 impedes STING phosphorylation and translocation, resulting in reduced activation of STING.",IFI16 AND STING AND phosphorylation AND translocation,"28194029,27764250,26134128,26121674,24349538,41187334,41187107,41187089,41187049,41186968","[PMID: 28194029] Many human cells can sense the presence of exogenous DNA during infection though the cytosolic DNA receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which produces the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Other putative DNA receptors have been described, but whether their functions are redundant, tissue-specific or integrated in the cGAS-cGAMP pathway is unclear. Here we show that interferon-γ inducible protein 16 (IFI16) cooperates with cGAS during DNA sensing in human keratinocytes, as both cGAS and IFI16 are required for the full activation of an innate immune response to exogenous DNA and DNA viruses. IFI16 is also required for the cGAMP-induced activation of STING, and interacts with STING to promote STING phosphorylation and translocation. We propose that the two DNA sensors IFI16 and cGAS cooperate to prevent the spurious activation of the type I interferon response.

[PMID: 27764250] IFI16 (gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16), a predominantly nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation, also functions as an innate immune response DNA sensor and induces the IL-1β and antiviral type-1 interferon-β (IFN-β) cytokines. We have shown that IFI16, in association with BRCA1, functions as a sequence independent nuclear sensor of episomal dsDNA genomes of KSHV, EBV and HSV-1. Recognition of these herpesvirus genomes resulted in IFI16 acetylation, BRCA1-IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1 inflammasome formation, cytoplasmic translocation, and IL-1β generation. Acetylated IFI16 also interacted with cytoplasmic STING and induced IFN-β. However, the identity of IFI16 associated nuclear proteins involved in STING activation and the mechanism is not known. Mass spectrometry of proteins precipitated by anti-IFI16 antibodies from uninfected endothelial cell nuclear lysate revealed that histone H2B interacts with IFI16. Single and double proximity ligation microscopy, immunoprecipitation, EdU-genome labeled virus infection, and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that H2B is associated with IFI16 and BRCA1 in the nucleus in physiological conditions. De novo KSHV and HSV-1 infection as well as latent KSHV and EBV infection induces the cytoplasmic distribution of H2B-IFI16, H2B-BRCA1 and IFI16-ASC complexes. Vaccinia virus (dsDNA) cytoplasmic replication didn't induce the redistribution of nuclear H2B-IFI16 or H2B into the cytoplasm. H2B is critical in KSHV and HSV-1 genome recognition by IFI16 during de novo infection. Viral genome sensing by IFI16-H2B-BRCA1 leads to BRCA1 dependent recruitment of p300, and acetylation of H2B and IFI16. BRCA1 knockdown or inhibition of p300 abrogated the acetylation of H2B-IFI16 or H2B. Ran-GTP protein mediated the translocation of acetylated H2B and IFI16 to the cytoplasm along with BRCA1 that is independent of IFI16-ASC inflammasome. ASC knockdown didn't affect the acetylation of H2B, its cytoplasmic transportation, and the association of STING with IFI16 and H2B during KSHV infection. Absence of H2B didn't affect IFI16-ASC association and cytoplasmic distribution and thus demonstrating that IFI16-H2B complex is independent of IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1-inflammasome complex formed during infection. The H2B-IFI16-BRCA1 complex interacted with cGAS and STING in the cytoplasm leading to TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of pIRF3 and IFN-β production. Silencing of H2B, cGAS and STING inhibited IFN-β induction but not IL-1β secretion, and cGAMP activity is significantly reduced by H2B and IFI16 knockdown during infection. Silencing of ASC inhibited IL-1β secretion but not IFN-β secretion during de novo KSHV and HSV-1 infection. These studies identify H2B as an innate nuclear sensor mediating a novel extra chromosomal function, and reveal that two IFI16 complexes mediate KSHV and HSV-1 genome recognition responses, with recognition by the IFI16-BRCA1-H2B complex resulting in IFN-β responses and recognition by IFI16-BRCA1 resulting in inflammasome responses.

[PMID: 26134128] The IL-1β and type I interferon-β (IFN-β) molecules are important inflammatory cytokines elicited by the eukaryotic host as innate immune responses against invading pathogens and danger signals. Recently, a predominantly nuclear gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) involved in transcriptional regulation has emerged as an innate DNA sensor which induced IL-1β and IFN-β production through inflammasome and STING activation, respectively. Herpesvirus (KSHV, EBV, and HSV-1) episomal dsDNA genome recognition by IFI16 leads to IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1 inflammasome association, cytoplasmic translocation and IL-1β production. Independent of ASC, HSV-1 genome recognition results in IFI16 interaction with STING in the cytoplasm to induce interferon-β production. However, the mechanisms of IFI16-inflammasome formation, cytoplasmic redistribution and STING activation are not known. Our studies here demonstrate that recognition of herpesvirus genomes in the nucleus by IFI16 leads into its interaction with histone acetyltransferase p300 and IFI16 acetylation resulting in IFI16-ASC interaction, inflammasome assembly, increased interaction with Ran-GTPase, cytoplasmic redistribution, caspase-1 activation, IL-1β production, and interaction with STING which results in IRF-3 phosphorylation, nuclear pIRF-3 localization and interferon-β production. ASC and STING knockdowns did not affect IFI16 acetylation indicating that this modification is upstream of inflammasome-assembly and STING-activation. Vaccinia virus replicating in the cytoplasm did not induce nuclear IFI16 acetylation and cytoplasmic translocation. IFI16 physically associates with KSHV and HSV-1 genomes as revealed by proximity ligation microscopy and chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies which is not hampered by the inhibition of acetylation, thus suggesting that acetylation of IFI16 is not required for its innate sensing of nuclear viral genomes. Collectively, these studies identify the increased nuclear acetylation of IFI16 as a dynamic essential post-genome recognition event in the nucleus that is common to the IFI16-mediated innate responses of inflammasome induction and IFN-β production during herpesvirus (KSHV, EBV, HSV-1) infections.

[PMID: 26121674] The innate immune system pattern recognition receptors (PRR) are the first line of host defenses recognizing the various pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns and eliciting defenses by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-18 or interferon β (IFN-β). NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) are cytoplasmic inflammasome sensors of foreign molecules, including DNA. IFI16, a sequence-independent nuclear innate sensor ALR, recognizes episomal dsDNA genomes of herpes viruses such as KSHV, EBV, and HSV-1 in the infected cell nuclei, forms an inflammasome complex with ASC and procaspase1, and relocates into the cytoplasm leading into Caspase-1 and IL-1β generation. IFI16 also induces IFN-β during HSV-1 infection via the cytoplasmic STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway. Thus far, whether IFI16 recognizes foreign DNA directly or utilizes other host protein(s) is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that BRCA1, a DNA damage repair sensor and transcription regulator, is in complex with IFI16 in the host cell nucleus, and their association increases in the presence of nuclear viral genomes during de novo KSHV, EBV and HSV-1 infection, and in latent KSHV or EBV infection, but not by DNA damage responses (DDR) induced by bleomycin and vaccinia virus cytoplasmic dsDNA. BRCA1 is a constituent of the triggered IFI16-inflammasome and is translocated into the cytoplasm after genome recognition along with the IFI16-inflammasome. The absence of BRCA1 abrogated IFI16-viral genome association, inflammasome assembly, IFI16 cytoplasmic localization, and Caspase-1 and IL-1β production. The absence of BRCA1 also abolished the cytoplasmic IFI16-STING interaction, downstream IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of pIRF3 and IFN-β production during de novo KSHV and HSV-1 infection. These findings highlight that BRCA1 plays a hitherto unidentified innate immunomodulatory role by facilitating nuclear foreign DNA sensing by IFI16, subsequent assembly and cytoplasmic distribution of IFI16-inflammasomes leading into IL-1β formation and the induction of IFN-β via cytoplasmic signaling through IFI16-STING, TBK1 and IRF3.

[PMID: 24349538] Cytoplasmic viral RNA and DNA are recognized by RIG-I-like receptors and DNA sensors that include DAI, IFI16, DDX41, and cGAS. The RNA and DNA sensors evoke innate immune responses through the IPS-1 and STING adaptors. IPS-1 and STING activate TBK1 kinase. TBK1 is phosphorylated in its activation loop, leading to IRF3/7 activation and Type I interferon (IFN) production. IPS-1 and STING localize to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, whereas it is unclear where phosphorylated TBK1 is localized in response to cytoplasmic viral DNA. Here, we investigated phospho-TBK1 (p-TBK1) subcellular localization using a p-TBK1-specific antibody. Stimulation with vertebrate DNA by transfection increased p-TBK1 levels. Interestingly, stimulation-induced p-TBK1 exhibited mitochondrial localization in HeLa and HepG2 cells and colocalized with mitochondrial IPS-1 and MFN-1. Hepatitis B virus DNA stimulation or herpes simplex virus type-1 infection also induced p-TBK1 mitochondrial localization in HeLa cells, indicating that cytoplasmic viral DNA induces p-TBK1 mitochondrial localization in HeLa cells. In contrast, p-TBK1 did not show mitochondrial localization in RAW264.7, L929, or T-23 cells, and most of p-TBK1 colocalized with STING in response to cytoplasmic DNA in those mammalian cells, indicating cell type-specific localization of p-TBK1 in response to cytoplasmic viral DNA. A previous knockout study showed that mouse IPS-1 was dispensable for Type I IFN production in response to cytoplasmic DNA. However, we found that knockdown of IPS-1 markedly reduced p-TBK1 levels in HeLa cells. Taken together, our data elucidated the cell type-specific subcellular localization of p-TBK1 and a cell type-specific role of IPS-1 in TBK1 activation in response to cytoplasmic viral DNA.

[PMID: 41187334] Hexokinase domain containing protein 1 (HKDC1) is a recently discovered fifth human hexokinase isozyme that is significantly upregulated in several disease states, including lung and liver cancers. Cellular studies suggest that HKDC1 is a low activity hexokinase; however, its functional characteristics have remained enigmatic. Here, we describe the kinetic and regulatory features of recombinant human HKDC1, demonstrating it to be a robust hexokinase (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub> = 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) with a unique glucose <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value (0.49 ± 0.07 mM) that differs markedly from all other human hexokinase isozymes. The isolated C-terminal domain of HKDC1 displays kinetic characteristics nearly identical to the full-length enzyme, whereas the N-terminal domain is inactive. Unlike all other 100 kDa vertebrate hexokinases characterized to date, HKDC1 is insensitive to product inhibition by physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate, with apparent inhibition constants above 1 mM. The hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is also insensitive to Dinaciclib, a pan cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that reportedly disrupts the ability of nuclear localized HKDC1 to phosphorylate retinoblastoma-binding protein 5. Conversely, the hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is potently inhibited by a synthetic glucosamine derivative previously developed for hexokinase 1 and 2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 103 ± 6 nM. An HKDC1 variant associated with retinitis pigmentosa, T58M, displays a modest, but statistically significant 2-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub>) compared to the wild-type enzyme. Together, our results provide a detailed functional characterization of recombinant HKDC1 and set the stage for investigating the link between HKDC1 catalysis and human disease.

[PMID: 41187107] Emerging clinical evidence suggests a link between environmental noise and the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNcDA neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNcDA neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41187089] Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling plays a crucial role in plant immunity, regulating both pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) through cell-surface receptors and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) via intracellular nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs). Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs/CDPKs) serve as key Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors and signal transducers in these processes. In this study, we demonstrate the relevance of two rice CPKs, OsCPK5 and OsCPK13, for rice blast resistance. Both are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive kinases, with potential in planta heteromer formation enhancing their phosphorylation/signaling functions. Single <i>oscpk5</i> and <i>oscpk13</i> mutants exhibit impaired early PTI responses and enhanced susceptibility to rice blast fungus, suggesting that these kinases are essential for effective immunity. Surprisingly, although it is also defective in PTI, the <i>oscpk5</i>/<i>13</i> double mutant displays enhanced resistance to rice blast. An NLR protein OsCPK5/13-ASSOCIATING RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1 (OsCARP1), which is physically associated with both OsCPK5 and OsCPK13, is genetically required for the heightened resistance of <i>oscpk5</i>/<i>13.</i> Furthermore, OsCARP1-induced cell death in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> can be suppressed by the expression of OsCPK5 and OsCPK13. Based on these findings, we postulate that the positive blast resistance roles of OsCPK5 and OsCPK13 are guarded by OsCARP1, thus leading to OsCARP1-dependent ETI resistance in the <i>oscpk5</i>/<i>13</i> double mutant or upon manipulation by still unknown pathogen effectors during infection. Our results offer insights into how plants counteract potential pathogen attack on key Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling immune components.

[PMID: 41187049] Plasmodium falciparum hexose transporter 1 protein or PfHT1 is the major glucose transporter of the parasite and indispensable for its survival at the blood stage of infection. PfHT1 transports the hexose sugar to meet the energy demand of the parasite. Studying the mechanism of transport and designing structure specific inhibitors against PfHT1 is an intelligent strategy to kill malaria parasite by starving it out because at the blood stage the sole carbon source of Plasmodium falciparum is glucose. In this study the conformational dynamics of PfHT1 has been studied in detail in the apo and holo (inhibitor bound) form using Molecular Dynamics Simulation, which reveals that PfHT1 undergoes ligand induced closed state if compared with the apo form. The geometry of ligand binding pocket also shifts from the apo form in the presence of inhibitors. The lead molecules were obtained from screening nearly 4500 compounds. A de novo drug designing approach based on the skeleton of the leads, has produced inhibitors of PfHT1 with higher specificity and affinity. The drug screening data as well as the conformational dynamics study was validated using Molecular Dynamics Simulation. In simulation a near physiological environment was created for PfHT1 by constructing a lipid phase (phospholipid bilayer) sandwiched between aqueous phases (mimics extracellular and cytosolic polar environment).

[PMID: 41186968] Rice cooking and eating quality (CEQ), a core agronomic trait tied to consumer preference and market value, is regulated by endosperm starch, protein, and lipid metabolism; this review synthesizes advances in its molecular mechanisms, focusing on genetic determinants and regulatory networks of storage substances. Starch is key: the Wx gene (central hub) has ≥ 9 allelic variants (e.g., Wxᵃ, Wxᵇ and Wx<sup>ela</sup>), modulating amylose content (AC) via GBSSI activity, Wx gene expression levels, splicing efficiency, etc., and exerting pleiotropic effects on protein/lipid metabolism, grain transparency, and taste; storage proteins (80% glutelin) harm CEQ by inhibiting starch gelatinisation, regulated by relevant gene families and vesicular pathways (e.g., Rab5a-VPS9a); lipids (0.3%-3% of endosperm) affect Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) profiles and aroma via genes like OsFAD, PDCT, FGC3; modules (e.g., OsNF-Ys, OsbZIP60, Ghd7-OsNAC42) balance starch-protein accumulation. Breeding strategies include marker-assisted selection, CRISPR/Cas9 editing of Wx elements or glutelin genes, gene pyramiding (Wx, ALK, GS3), and artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated intelligent breeding to boost efficiency; the review first proposes a framework: 'Wx genotype determination - amylopectin/glutelin regulation - CEQ improvement', and the establishment of this framework is rooted in the core role of the Wx gene in determining rice eating quality, which is achieved through its pleiotropic regulation of starch, protein, and lipid metabolism in the endosperm. Future directions: use Wx allelic diversity, decipher multi-omics modules (e.g., RNA methylation in starch metabolism), and integrate aroma, Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), grain shape, chalkiness, sugar transport genes to balance yield and CEQ for rice breeding.",10
IgA plasma cells that are specific for transglutaminase 2 are scarce in the duodenal mucosa of celiac disease patients when the disease is active.,IgA plasma cells AND transglutaminase 2 AND duodenal mucosa AND celiac disease activity,"22366952,41186447,41184249,41174365,41169469,41168619,41163720,41156639,41155892,41155294","[PMID: 22366952] Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder in which mucosal autoantibodies to the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are generated in response to the exogenous antigen gluten in individuals who express human leukocyte antigen HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 (ref. 3). We assessed in a comprehensive and nonbiased manner the IgA anti-TG2 response by expression cloning of the antibody repertoire of ex vivo-isolated intestinal antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). We found that TG2-specific plasma cells are markedly expanded within the duodenal mucosa in individuals with active celiac disease. TG2-specific antibodies were of high affinity yet showed little adaptation by somatic mutations. Unlike infection-induced peripheral blood plasmablasts, the TG2-specific ASCs had not recently proliferated and were not short-lived ex vivo. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that there is a germline repertoire with high affinity for TG2 that may favor massive generation of autoreactive B cells. TG2-specific antibodies did not block enzymatic activity and served as substrates for TG2-mediated crosslinking when expressed as IgD or IgM but not as IgA1 or IgG1. This could result in preferential recruitment of plasma cells from naive IgD- and IgM-expressing B cells, thus possibly explaining why the antibody response to TG2 bears signs of a primary immune response despite the disease chronicity.

[PMID: 41186447] In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), human intestinal myofibroblasts (HIMF) gets activated due to chronic inflammation and start accumulating excessive extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM drives the significant clinical problem of intestinal fibrosis and stricture formation in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients that require surgical intervention in a large group of the population. In this review, we delineate the role of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a matrix bound, calcium (Ca) dependent enzyme, as an important effector in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. We discuss the role of TG2 in fibrotic diseases with a focus on intestinal fibrosis and TG2 as a potential target for therapy of stricturing CD. This review additionally covers the progress in our mechanistic understanding of TG2 as a marker and driver for intestinal fibrosis and stricture formation in IBD patients. TG2 May play a central role in promoting inflammation independent progression of fibrosis, potentially explaining the lack of efficacy of traditional anti-inflammatory drugs in fibrotic diseases. The anti-fibrotic potential of TG2 specific inhibitors in stricturing Crohn's disease are just starting to be explored. Further investigations are needed to identify novel mechanisms for TG2 specific inhibitors in the intestine.

[PMID: 41184249] Differentiation syndrome (DS) is a serious complication with an unclear pathogenesis that arises following all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or arsenic trioxide induction therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). DS symptoms include pyrexia, respiratory compromise, increased body mass, fluid accumulation, pulmonary infiltrates, hypotension, tachycardia, edema, and sepsis. It can also affect the kidneys and the central nervous system. The standard treatment to counteract DS involves the temporary cessation of ATRA or arsenic trioxide treatment and the administration of high-dose steroids to mitigate the inflammatory response. If left untreated, DS can be fatal. Further research has revealed that the inability to promptly recognize intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with APL may result in lethal consequences, with the cytokine storm identified as the principal factor in this scenario as well. ATRA therapy is known to induce transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which functions as a catalyst for DS development. In this study, we used NB4 cell lines and cells from a human patient with APL to investigate the ex vivo effects of ATRA and 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> cotreatment on NF-κB-regulated luciferase reporter gene activity. ATRA alone substantially enhanced cellular NF-κB luciferase reporter gene activity, whereas 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> dose-dependently reduced this activity. During ATRA-initiated cell maturation, 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, known as calcidiol, suppressed the mRNA expression of NF-κB (p65/p50) and Rel family members, as well as the expression of genes associated with increased NF-κB activity. 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> also inhibited the ATRA-induced production of cytokines (e.g., IL-8), including IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1, associated with the ""cytokine storm."" Combined treatment with ATRA plus 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> reduced cellular phospho-p65 and transglutaminase 2 (TG2) levels and increased the level of inhibitor of Rel (IκB), thereby attenuating the cytokine storm. These findings provide a molecular interpretation for clinical DS and IHC observations and may support future exploration of ATRA plus 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> cotreatment as a therapy for APL.

[PMID: 41174365] The objective of the present work was to assess if the degree of crosslinking of pea proteins (PPI) by transglutaminase (TG) affects the in vitro gastric digestion of pea proteins in the bulk and at the oil-water interface as well as the duodenal lipolysis of the emulsions. PPI samples were prepared at protein concentrations of 10-18 % w/w and 1 % TG at 37 °C and characterized by small deformation tests and texture measurements. The degree of crosslinking linearly decreased with the increase of protein concentration and at the same time a loss of elasticity occurred. However, both the storage modulus G' and gel hardness increased with increasing protein concentration. These three crosslinked proteins were tested regarding their susceptibility to be hydrolysed by pepsin as well as the behaviour of their emulsions during in vitro gastroduodenal digestion. As the degree of crosslinking of the samples increases and they are more homogeneous (lower PPI concentration), they are more rapidly hydrolysed by pepsin in the bulk because the enzyme and the acid may easily diffuse into the gel microparticles. At the interface, lower degrees of PPI crosslinking would allow a higher structural flexibility, exposing peptide bonds that pepsin can more easily cleave. The rate of lipolysis increased as the degree of crosslinking decreased but at the end of duodenal digestion they converged to similar values. A correlation was found between the kinetics of gastric proteolysis of emulsions mediated by pepsin and the kinetics of duodenal lipolysis.

[PMID: 41169469] Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes refer to a group of disorders characterized by dysfunction in two or more endocrine glands, often accompanied by autoimmune involvement in non-endocrine tissues. A 6-year-old girl was admitted due to suspected diabetes mellitus. The symptoms observed by the parents were polyuria, polydipsia, and an acetone odor. Physical examination revealed a dry oral mucosa, a tongue coated with a white film, ecchymoses on the upper limbs, and a distended abdomen, arched above the chest level, and increased bowel sounds. After comprehensive differential diagnostics, the patient was identified with diabetes mellitus type 1, autoimmune hepatitis, immune thrombocytopenia, celiac disease, and thus autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 4. The case illustrates a very rare combination of coexisting autoimmune disorders. When a patient is diagnosed with one autoimmune disease, it is crucial to screen actively for other autoimmune conditions. It is essential to remember that the clinical presentation of a patient is often the result of overlapping symptoms from multiple conditions.

[PMID: 41168619] Drug permeability across epithelial barriers is critical for predicting oral bioavailability and efficacy. Conventional models, including animals and simple cell cultures, lack intestinal complexity and translational value. Organoids and organ-on-a-chip technologies address these limitations, offering physiologically relevant, human-specific platforms for more accurate drug permeability assessment [1]. Intestinal organoids, derived from stem cells, reproduce key structural and functional features of the gut, including crypt-villus organization, transporter and enzyme expression, and absorptive and secretory functions. Organoids are grown inside of microfluidic chips under dynamic media flow that attempt to recapitulate one or more tissue-specific functions, thereby supporting epithelial maturation and enabling more predictive drug transport measurements. Permeability can be studied by introducing compounds at the apical surface and quantifying their translocation to the basolateral compartment using analytical techniques. Compared with animal models, these approaches yield data of greater human relevance while reducing ethical concerns [2]. Furthermore, they enable the evaluation of passive permeability, active transport, intestinal metabolism, and interactions with microbial products [3]. In this study, permeability was investigated for three model compounds with distinct properties: lisinopril (low permeability), metoprolol (moderate permeability), and fluconazole (high permeability). Experiments were conducted using the Emulate human duodenum-on-a-chip platform and benchmarked against the Ralph Russ Canine Kidney (RRCK) cell line. Apparent permeability (P<sub>app</sub>) values were correlated with literature-reported effective permeability (P<sub>eff</sub>) using linear regression. This regression was implemented in Simcyp® Simulator and GastroPlus™ to predict systemic exposure, which was compared against observed plasma concentration-time profiles.

[PMID: 41163720] Human tissue transglutaminase (hTG2) is a multifunctional enzyme with both protein cross-linking and G-protein activity. Dysregulation of these functions has been implicated in diseases such as celiac disease and cancer, prompting the development of hTG2 inhibitors, many of which act covalently <i>via</i> a pendant electrophilic warhead. Most small molecule hTG2 inhibitors to date feature terminal, sterically minimal warheads, based on the assumption that bulkier electrophiles impair binding and reactivity. Here, we report structure-activity relationships (SAR) of a novel internal alkynyl warhead scaffold for irreversible inhibition of hTG2. This series includes one of the most potent non-peptidic hTG2 inhibitors reported to date. We demonstrate that this scaffold not only inhibits transamidase activity but also abolishes GTP binding, while exhibiting excellent isozyme selectivity. In addition, we investigate the tunability and stability of this warhead, providing insights into its broader applicability. Through detailed kinetic analysis, this study establishes a new scaffold for irreversible hTG2 inhibition and expands the design principles for covalent warheads beyond traditional terminal systems.

[PMID: 41156639] Rotavirus (RV) is one of the main etiologic agents associated with diarrheal diseases (DDs), being responsible for approximately 200 thousand deaths annually. Currently, there are still many aspects regarding the virus biology, cell cycle, and pathophysiology of RV that need further elucidation. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate whether the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) might be associated with RV infection. This immune receptor has been observed as an amplifier of inflammatory responses in different infectious and non-infectious diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Initially, we searched for public transcriptomic data regarding RV infection and the expression of TREM-1 and its associated genes, which were significantly upregulated in infected mice and children. Then, we infected monocytes with the virus, with or without a TREM-1 inhibitor. The inhibition of the receptor's activity resulted in a significant decrease in IL-1β production. We also observed a reduction in cytopathic effects when MA104 cells were treated with TREM-1 inhibitors and then infected with simian RV. To further elucidate the interactions between the virus and TREM-1, in silico tools were used to simulate interactions between the receptor and RV proteins. These simulations suggested the occurrence of interactions between TREM-1 and VP5*, a protein involved in viral attachment to target cells, and also between the receptor and NSP4, a viral enterotoxin with immunostimulant properties. Hence, our results indicate that TREM-1 is involved in RV infection, both as a mediator of inflammatory responses and as a player in the host-virus relationship.

[PMID: 41155892] <b>Background</b>: Drug resistance (DR) mediated by ABC transporters in the cytoplasmic membrane has been one of the best studied mechanisms of DR in vitro. More recently, it has also been suggested that ABC transporters expressed on lysosomal membranes could increase the sequestration of anticancer drugs in lysosomes, thereby reducing their concentration at target sites, and causing DR. Unfortunately, convincing evidence that such a DR mechanism actually exists is lacking, even in the case of in vitro experiments. <b>Methods</b>: This hypothetical study using simplified models evaluates the effect of ABC transporter-mediated accumulation of anticancer drugs in lysosomes on their concentration at target sites under standard in vitro conditions. <b>Results</b>: Calculations show that an ABC transporter resident on the plasma membrane must create and maintain a relatively small concentration gradient between extracellular space and the target site to reduce the drug concentration at the target site by, for example, half. In contrast, if a lysosomal ABC transporter is to also halve the concentration of the drug at the target site, then it must create and maintain a huge concentration gradient between lysosomes and target sites. It is very likely that massive accumulation of drugs in lysosomes would have a negative effect on the function of the lysosomes themselves. <b>Conclusions</b>: The results of this hypothetical study strongly suggest that the mechanism of DR mediated by lysosomal ABC transporters is questionable, as it requires enormous accumulation of the drug in lysosomes, which would likely also impair their function. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this hypothetical DR mechanism could actually be utilized by tumor cells to defend against the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy in vitro.

[PMID: 41155294] Stress is a predisposing factor for pulmonary diseases; however, its effects on the lungs of healthy individuals have not been fully elucidated. Since bovine lactoferrin (bLf) is a powerful immunomodulator, this study aimed to evaluate whether lactoferrin can modulate the effects of chronic stress on humoral and cellular immunity in the lungs. We performed chronic restraint stress (RS) and oral administration of bLf in a BALB/c model, assessing serum corticosterone, body weight, and various lung immunity parameters, including immunoglobulin concentrations in serum and tracheobronchial lavages (TBLs), secretory IgA (S-IgA) levels in TBLs, IgA-secreting plasma cells, relative expression of pIgR, CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte Th1 and Th2 populations, and antigen-presenting cell (APC) populations in the lungs. Our results demonstrate that stress increases corticosterone and production of total IgA and IgG, while decreasing levels of IgM and S-IgA, promotes a Th1/Th2 profile imbalance, and decreases APC populations. Interestingly, bLf modulates serum corticosterone levels and stress-induced weight loss, and it also modulates humoral and cellular effects produced by chronic stress. These results demonstrate that bLf should be considered a new therapeutic target for further studies, focusing on prophylactic and co-therapeutic administration to treat and prevent respiratory diseases.",10

We sought to examine how the genetic variants of the MSY influence male susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis. Approach and Results: Analysis of 129 133 men from UK Biobank revealed that only one of 7 common MSY haplogroups (haplogroup I1) was associated with CAD-carriers of haplogroup I1 had ≈11% increase in risk of CAD when compared with all other haplogroups combined (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18; <i>P</i>=6.8×10<sup>-4</sup>). Targeted MSY sequencing uncovered 235 variants exclusive to this haplogroup. The haplogroup I1-specific variants showed 2.45- and 1.56-fold respective enrichment for promoter and enhancer chromatin states, in cells/tissues relevant to atherosclerosis, when compared with other MSY variants. Gene set enrichment analysis in CAD-relevant tissues showed that haplogroup I1 was associated with changes in pathways responsible for early and late stages of atherosclerosis development including defence against pathogens, immunity, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial respiration, lipids, coagulation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. <i>UTY</i> was the only Y chromosome gene whose blood expression was associated with haplogroup I1. Experimental reduction of <i>UTY</i> expression in macrophages led to changes in expression of 59 pathways (28 of which overlapped with those associated with haplogroup I1) and a significant reduction in the immune costimulatory signal. Haplogroup I1 is enriched for regulatory chromatin variants in numerous cells of relevance to CAD and increases cardiovascular risk through proatherosclerotic reprogramming of the transcriptome, partly through <i>UTY</i>.

[PMID: 28238413] Haplogroup I, a common European paternal lineage of the Y chromosome, is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease in British men. It is unclear whether this haplogroup or any other haplogroup on the Y chromosome is associated with histological characteristics of the diseased vessel wall in other vascular manifestations of cardiovascular diseases showing a male preponderance. We examined Dutch men undergoing either carotid endarterectomy from the Athero-Express biobank (AE, n = 1217) or open aneurysm repair from the Aneurysm-Express biobank (AAA, n = 393). Upon resolving the Y chromosome phylogeny, each man was assigned to one of the paternal lineages based on combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome. We examined the associations between the Y chromosome and the histological characteristics of the carotid plaque and aneurysm wall, including lipid content, leukocyte infiltration and intraplaque haemorrhage, in all men. A majority of men were carriers of either haplogroup I (AE: 28% AAA: 24%) or haplogroup R (AE: 59% AAA: 61%). We found no association between Y chromosomal haplogroups and histological characteristics of plaque collected from carotid arteries or tissue specimens of aneurysms. Moreover, the distribution of frequency for all Y chromosomal haplogroups in both cohorts was similar to that of a general population of Dutch men. Our data show that genetic variation on the Y chromosome is not associated with histological characteristics of the plaques from carotid arteries or specimens of aneurysms in men of Dutch origin.

[PMID: 23640493] Haplogroup I of male-specific region of the human Y chromosome is associated with 50% increased risk of coronary artery disease. It is not clear to what extent conventional cardiovascular risk factors and genes of the male-specific region may explain this association. A total of 1988 biologically unrelated men from 4 white European populations were genotyped using 11 Y chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms and classified into 13 most common European haplogroups. Approximately 75% to 93% of the haplotypic variation of the Y chromosome in all cohorts was attributable to I, R1a, and R1b1b2 lineages. None of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including body mass index, blood pressures, lipids, glucose, C-reactive protein, creatinine, and insulin resistance, was associated with haplogroup I of the Y chromosome in the joint inverse variance meta-analysis. Fourteen of 15 ubiquitous single-copy genes of the male-specific region were expressed in human macrophages. When compared with men with other haplogroups, carriers of haplogroup I had ≈ 0.61- and 0.64-fold lower expression of ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat, Y-linked gene (UTY) and protein kinase, Y-linked, pseudogene (PRKY) in macrophages (P=0.0001 and P=0.002, respectively). Coronary artery disease predisposing haplogroup I of the Y chromosome is associated with downregulation of UTY and PRKY genes in macrophages but not with conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

[PMID: 22325189] A sexual dimorphism exists in the incidence and prevalence of coronary artery disease--men are more commonly affected than are age-matched women. We explored the role of the Y chromosome in coronary artery disease in the context of this sexual inequity. We genotyped 11 markers of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome in 3233 biologically unrelated British men from three cohorts: the British Heart Foundation Family Heart Study (BHF-FHS), West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), and Cardiogenics Study. On the basis of this information, each Y chromosome was tracked back into one of 13 ancient lineages defined as haplogroups. We then examined associations between common Y chromosome haplogroups and the risk of coronary artery disease in cross-sectional BHF-FHS and prospective WOSCOPS. Finally, we undertook functional analysis of Y chromosome effects on monocyte and macrophage transcriptome in British men from the Cardiogenics Study. Of nine haplogroups identified, two (R1b1b2 and I) accounted for roughly 90% of the Y chromosome variants among British men. Carriers of haplogroup I had about a 50% higher age-adjusted risk of coronary artery disease than did men with other Y chromosome lineages in BHF-FHS (odds ratio 1·75, 95% CI 1·20-2·54, p=0·004), WOSCOPS (1·45, 1·08-1·95, p=0·012), and joint analysis of both populations (1·56, 1·24-1·97, p=0·0002). The association between haplogroup I and increased risk of coronary artery disease was independent of traditional cardiovascular and socioeconomic risk factors. Analysis of macrophage transcriptome in the Cardiogenics Study revealed that 19 molecular pathways showing strong differential expression between men with haplogroup I and other lineages of the Y chromosome were interconnected by common genes related to inflammation and immunity, and that some of them have a strong relevance to atherosclerosis. The human Y chromosome is associated with risk of coronary artery disease in men of European ancestry, possibly through interactions of immunity and inflammation.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187363] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains a major respiratory pathogen of economic concern in the poultry industry. This study investigated the farm-level prevalence of IBV and evaluated associated risk factors in northern Vietnam by a cross-sectional study from June 2022 to June 2024. A total of 69 poultry farms were randomly selected across nine provinces, and pooled tracheal swab samples were purposively collected for IBV detection using RT-qPCR. The overall IBV farm-level prevalence was 34.78 % (95 % CI:23.71-47.21 %). Although no statistically significant differences were found across provinces, production types, age groups, or flock sizes, IBV was detected in all subgroups, indicating widespread circulation of the virus. A total of 22 potential risk factors were initially assessed using univariate logistic regression. Of these, six variables with P < 0.1, including farm size, number of poultry houses, presence of multiple age groups, vaccination at day-old, frequency of disinfection before chick placement, and proximity to live bird markets and residential areas, were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model retained two independent predictors: performing more than one disinfection before chick placement (P = 0.035), and administration of a live IB vaccine at one day of age (P = 0.006), both of which were significantly associated with reduced the odds of IBV infection at the farm level. These findings suggest that strategic vaccination and careful calibration of disinfection protocols are critical to minimizing IBV transmission at the farm level.

[PMID: 41187309] Cardiovascular disorders are closely linked to metabolic syndrome and remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, despite advances in early detection and treatment. Adipokines, cardiokines, and myokines play critical roles in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis. In this study, we measured serum levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), irisin, and adiponectin in 243 male patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. We investigated the associations of these biomarkers with coronary artery disease (CAD) and their correlation with metabolic syndrome status. FSTL1 levels were predicted using a Particle Swarm Optimization-enhanced Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (PSO-ANFIS) based on artificial intelligence. Patients with CAD exhibited significantly lower FABP4 levels (p<0.0001), and low FABP4 levels emerged as an independent predictor of CAD in logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 0.903, 95% CI 0.825-0.987, p=0.025). The combination of adiponectin, FSTL1, and irisin as a biomarker strategy demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96). Both FSTL1 and adiponectin independently correlated with metabolic syndrome (p<0.001, odds ratio 1.039, 95% CI 1.025-1.054; p<0.001, odds ratio 0.979, 95% CI 0.971-0.988, respectively). The prediction of FSTL1 levels using PSO-ANFIS supports the concept of harmonization among metabolic messengers. These findings underscore the potential of FABP4 and FSTL1 as valuable biomarkers for diagnosing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, thereby facilitating personalized interventions targeting organokine pathways.

[PMID: 41187304] Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) represents a complex interplay of pathophysiological processes that create a self-perpetuating cycle of heart and kidney dysfunction. While it is clearly understood how hemodynamic changes connect pathogenesis in the two organs, other processes are also in play. Some are the structural changes involving both the cellular and extracellular compartments that precede functional alterations. Fibrosis, which is initiated by an inflammatory response triggering myofibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix production, is a common denominator of heart and kidney pathology in CRS. This review focuses on fibroblast activities as a crucial factor in disease onset and progression in CRS. We explore how fibrosis in one organ can trigger or worsen dysfunction in the other organ, and we describe the key pathological signaling pathways of cardiorenal fibrosis, the extracellular matrix-derived biomarkers that can aid clinical management and drug development, and the therapeutic opportunities that can be beneficial in CRS by targeting fibroblast activities.

[PMID: 41187280] Parents of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) serve as primary caregivers and play a central role in decisions regarding their children's health care, development, and overall well-being. Their health information behavior directly influences the care decisions and outcomes of their children. In China, the online health information environment is vast but varies in quality, which places a significant information-seeking burden on them in the digital age. Moreover, Chinese cultural backgrounds shape parents' views, perspectives, and practices related to health information. To date, there have been no studies in China reporting on the experiences of parents of children with CHD concerning their health information behavior. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of health information behavior among parents of children with CHD during the disease journey through the lens of Chinese culture. This study used a descriptive phenomenological qualitative method. Face-to-face, semistructured, and in-depth interviews were conducted with parents of children with CHD from March to July 2025 at a tertiary grade A hospital located in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China. Data were collected and managed using the NVivo 12.0 software (QSR International), and thematic analysis was applied to identify and interpret participants' experiences and perspectives. A total of 24 parents of children with CHD participated in this study, including 6 fathers and 18 mothers. In total, 6 themes emerged from the data: (1) Looking for health information both online and offline; (2) Seeking health information from professionals and peers as well; (3) Evolving health information needs in the disease journey; (4) Showing diverse attitudes toward health information seeking; (5) Positive and negative feelings during health information behavior process; and (6) Disclosure versus concealment of children's disease information. Parents of children with CHD seek health information from both online and offline sources and also combine health information from professionals and peers. Medical institutions should provide authoritative information resources, while regulatory authorities should conduct professional reviews before disseminating health information online to foster a reliable information environment. Additional efforts should focus on utilizing rehabilitation narratives from peer networks, delivering personalized information support tailored to parents' information-seeking styles and children's disease stages, and offering training and services to stimulate and cultivate a conscious decision-making process regarding disease disclosure and sharing.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.",10

We show that many mRNAs encoding iron uptake or iron mobilization proteins are expressed in iron-replete conditions in the absence of the S. cerevisiae RNase III ortholog Rnt1p or of the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p. Extended forms of these mRNAs accumulate in the absence of Rnt1p or of the 5'-->3' exonucleases Xrn1p and Rat1p, showing that multiple degradative pathways contribute to the surveillance of aberrant forms of these transcripts. RNase III-deficient cells are hypersensitive to high iron concentrations, suggesting that Rnt1p-mediated RNA surveillance is required to prevent iron toxicity. These results show that RNA surveillance through multiple ribonucleolytic pathways plays a role in iron homeostasis in yeast to avoid the potentially toxic effects of the expression of the iron starvation response in iron-replete conditions.

[PMID: 41186395] A goal of multiomics experiments is to understand how mechanistic molecular biology is altered between conditions, typically a control group and experimental groups. Oftentimes, this involves studying changes in biomolecule relationships (e.g., interactions and metabolic relationships) of several types of biomolecules (e.g., lipids, metabolites, gene products like proteins). Though several databases contain relationships between biomolecules, understudied species may have little to no relationship information in databases and thus must be mined from the literature. There are several challenges to literature mining, including automated full-text extraction, duplicate biomolecule term collapsing, and implementation of complex machine learning tools. To make relationship extraction more accessible to the community, a Python package called <i>DancePartner</i> was developed to allow for the extraction of relationships from literature and databases, with functions to map biomolecule synonyms to standardized identifiers and visualize and characterize the resulting multiomics network. Here, two example data sets are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of <i>DancePartner</i>: one of 14,986 papers and abstracts for <i>Caernohabditis elegans</i>, and another of 33,606 papers and abstracts for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. These relationships are combined with relationships from KEGG, WikiPathways, UniProt, and LipidMaps, and they are visualized. Networks are then compared for their differences in build times.

[PMID: 41186358] Three types of iron(II)-triazole spin-crossover nanoparticles were synthesized using a micellar exchange approach, each coated with a thin silica shell. Two were obtained under optimized conditions, yielding rod-shaped nanoparticles (1np, 2np). The synthesis of the third one involved a reduced co-surfactant amount, which led to oval-shaped nanoparticles (3np). The particle size of 1np (42 nm × 21 nm), 2np (113 nm × 53 nm), and 3np (234 nm × 137 nm), and their quality were confirmed using TEM microscopy with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalyzer and powder X-ray diffraction. The spin-crossover properties of these compounds were then investigated through DC magnetometry and DSC calorimetry, considering the influence of particle size and magnetic field strength. Only the thermal hysteresis width Δ<i>T</i><sub>1/2</sub> turns out to be field independent, whereas the spin transition temperature (<i>T</i>↑1/2 and <i>T</i>↓1/2) and high-spin (HS) remnant fraction in the low-spin (LS) state change with varying the applied field. The magnetic field exerted the most significant influence on the HS remnant fraction in the LS state; specifically, applying a 70 kOe field reduced the HS phase by up to 24% compared to low-field conditions. Quantitative analysis of the spin-crossover behaviour was performed using the Slichter and Drickamer model.

[PMID: 41186282] <i>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</i> is a chemolithoautotrophic acidophilic bacterium widely found in industrial biomining operations. The cells obtain energy through iron and/or sulfur oxidation, and the resulting ferric iron can solubilize copper and other critical materials. The genetic engineering of acidophiles including <i>A. ferrooxidans</i> remains challenging due to limited molecular tools. In this study, we explored the feasibility of retron-based genetic engineering tools in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i> ATCC23270, leveraging a <i>pBAD</i> promoter system for inducible gene expression. We successfully expressed retron elements in <i>Escherichia coli</i> using the broad host pJRD215 plasmid and demonstrated both RNA and DNA antisense interference. We then expressed retron elements in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i> and targeted RNA antisense interference of the <i>PetA2</i> gene, which is a <i>bc</i>1 complex gene involved in the sulfur metabolism electron transport chain. Engineered strains exhibited reduced expression of sulfur oxidation genes and increased iron oxidation under high sulfur conditions, demonstrating retron-mediated regulation. While transcriptional interference was evident, genome editing in concert with the addition of a single-stranded annealing protein (SSAP), or recombineering, was not detected in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i>. These findings establish retrons as a viable new tool for genetic modulation in <i>A. ferrooxidans</i><i>,</i> suggesting a new capability for metabolic engineering of acidophilic extremophiles.

[PMID: 41186005] Aeromonas hydrophila-induced bacterial sepsis is a major threat to aquaculture, characterised by excessive inflammation, ferroptosis (an iron-dependent lipid peroxidation-driven cell death) and oxidative damage, which collectively lead to high mortality. Taurine (TAU) and glutathione (GSH) have been demonstrated to have potential therapeutic efficacy against ferroptosis-associated pathologies through redox modulation. However, their combined effects and underlying mechanisms in alleviating A. hydrophila infection remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the protective roles of TAU, GSH and their combination in vitro using yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) macrophages and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) kidney (CIK) cells and in vivo using yellow catfish challenged with A. hydrophila. The results showed that TAU and GSH, either alone or in combination, alleviated oxidative stress by significantly reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and inhibited nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway activation. This led to downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β), accompanied by alleviated ferroptosis. In vivo, dietary supplementation with TAU (10 g/kg) or GSH (350 mg/kg) alone improved survival rates (51.7% and 38.3%, respectively), reduced tissue bacterial loads and protected intestinal and hepatic tissues by preserving mucosal barrier function. However, the TAU + GSH combination unexpectedly decreased survival (28.3%) due to excessive immunosuppression (overproduction of IL-10 and TGF-β) and impaired mucosal barrier, which exacerbated pathogen colonisation. Together, our findings demonstrate that TAU and GSH alleviate A. hydrophila-induced oxidative stress by reducing mitochondrial ROS overproduction and disrupting the ROS/NF-κB signalling pathway, thereby attenuating inflammatory cytokine storms and ferroptosis. These results provide novel insights into the pathological mechanisms of bacterial sepsis in fish and develop sustainable strategies to improve disease resistance in aquaculture.

[PMID: 41185602] Silver nanoparticles are materials that exhibit good antimicrobial activity due to their unique properties. Silver nanoparticles obtained by using chemical synthesis techniques cause the formation of toxic products during and after the process. Therefore, there is a need for environmentally friendly, cheap, and fast synthesis. The green synthesis technique is developed as an alternative to chemical synthesis techniques, which enables the synthesis of silver nanoparticles in an environmentally friendly, cheap, and fast way. In this study, the potential of <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> (<i>G. glabra</i>, licorice) roots for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles was determined. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized using various techniques. It was determined that the obtained nanoparticles exhibited maximum absorbance at 420 nm, with an average size of 36 nm. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH·) radical scavenging activity of the synthesized nanoparticles was 94 ± 1.18%, the iron-reducing capacity was 55 ± 0.84%, and the antimicrobial activity, determined by the disk diffusion method on <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>), was found to be quite good.

[PMID: 41185323] In Mexico, the tequila industry is an important source of agro-industrial by-products, such as agave bagasse (AB). A second use of this high-fiber material may be accomplished by its incorporation into sourdough fermentation. This study evaluated the impact on the microbial communities in wheat sourdough added with AB and Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50307. Five treatments were evaluated, B1: wheat flour; BI2: B1 inoculated with L. lactis (10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL); C10: B1 + AB (10 % w/w); T5: BI2 + AB (5 % w/w); and T10: BI2 + AB (10 % w/w). Sourdough was produced after a 6-day fermentation at 25 °C, with daily evaluation of the fermentation quotient (FQ), fermentation curves (FC), and organic acid production. Acidification kinetics revealed that treatment T10 was the most stable during fermentation, with lactic acid as the primary metabolite produced, being significantly higher (p < 0.05) for treatments T10 and BI2 (11.5-12.2 mg/kg). From high-throughput sequencing, the addition of L. lactis exhibited increased dominance and population diversity in treatment T10. Diversity analysis revealed that Bacillota was the predominant bacterial phylum in most treatments. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was by far the dominant yeast species in all treatments, associated with the sourdoughs' acidification. From HPLC and GC-MS sugars (e.g., fructose and lactose) and volatile organic content (e.g., pentanoic acid, 2,3-dimethylpentane) varied depending on the sourdough treatment. AB may be utilized as a fiber source for sourdough production. Concurrently, the interaction between AB and L. lactis promoted an early stabilization of the sourdough acidification process, bacterial community modulation, and a different volatile compounds profile.

[PMID: 41184768] Methemoglobinemia is a potentially life-threatening condition resulting from the oxidation of hemoglobin's iron moiety from ferrous (Fe²⁺) to ferric (Fe³⁺). Clinical features include cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen therapy, chocolate-colored blood, and a marked saturation gap between pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas. Methylene blue remains the cornerstone of treatment; however, in rare instances, patients may exhibit refractory responses necessitating advanced interventions. Literature documenting methemoglobinemia due to fungicides like azoxystrobin and propiconazole remains scarce. A young female presented with altered sensorium, shock, and hypoxia following the ingestion of a fungicide containing azoxystrobin and propiconazole. Despite a PaO₂ of 400 mmHg on ABG, pulse oximetry showed 83% oxygen saturation, raising suspicion of dyshemoglobinemia. Methemoglobin levels were elevated at 80.7%. She was treated with intravenous methylene blue. While an initial decline in methemoglobin levels to 4% was observed, relapse occurred within 12 h. On day three, therapeutic red blood cell exchange transfusion was performed resulting in a reduction of methemoglobin levels to 14.2%. Despite aggressive measures, she succumbed to refractory shock on day five of admission. This report presents likely the first documented case of fatal methemoglobinemia due to ingestion of azoxystrobin and propiconazole-a combination fungicide widely used in agriculture. The case highlights the limitations of standard therapies like methylene blue in severe poisoning and underscores the need for early consideration of exchange transfusion. With the increasing use of such agents in rural communities, clinicians must maintain vigilance for unusual toxicities and ensure timely escalation in refractory cases.

Here we design an iron-embedded liquid metal catalyst that enables reversible switching of the aggregation and electron spin of iron atoms by controlling an external magnetic field. This facilitates a reversible conversion of the primary liquid products, methyl hydroperoxide (CH<sub>3</sub>OOH) and acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH), under ambient conditions.

In the absence of the magnetic field, iron atoms are atomically dispersed, leading to the C1 pathway without C-C bond coupling. When a magnetic field is applied, iron atoms cluster, favouring CH<sub>3</sub>COOH production in the C2 pathway. The product distribution can be finely and reversibly tuned with magnetic field intensity adjustments ranging from 0 to 500 G. Our findings highlight the potential for using an external magnetic field to precisely control catalytic pathways.

[PMID: 41184355] Given the nutritional importance of bread in the Iranian diet, ensuring its safety regarding chemical contaminants is crucial. This study assesses the potential health risks posed by heavy metals in bread available in Iran. A total of 248 bread samples were collected from 11 provinces during winter 2020. After sample preparation, the concentration of heavy metals was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. A health risk assessment model was employed to evaluate health effects and carcinogenic potential. The average concentrations of Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Cadmium (Cd), Aluminum (Al), Cobalt (Co), Lead (Pb), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), and Mercury (Hg) were 3.08 ± 1.24, 13.6 ± 44.94, 59.24 ± 30.62, 0.004 ± 0.02, 4.98 ± 2.85, 0.01 ± 0.03, 0.65 ± 1.71, 1 ± 1.42, 0.05 ± 0.23, and 0.03 ± 0.12 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Notably, the levels of Pb (0.65 ± 1.71 mg/kg) and Cr (1 ± 1.42 mg/kg) exceeded the WHO/FAO and Iranian National Standards threshold levels for both children and adults, indicating potential health risks. Overall, these findings suggest potential health and carcinogenic risks associated with heavy metals contamination in bread.

Although DCIS itself is confined to the milk duct and not immediately life-threatening, its potential for progression to invasive disease necessitates careful clinical management. The increased detection of DCIS due to advancements in imaging and widespread screening programs has raised critical questions regarding its classification, prognosis, and optimal treatment strategies. While most cases exhibit indolent behavior, others harbor molecular characteristics that drive malignant transformation. A key challenge lies in distinguishing low-risk DCIS, which may never progress, from aggressive cases requiring intervention. Tumor microenvironment dynamics, immune cell infiltration, and molecular alterations, including hormone receptor (HR) status, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) expression, and genetic mutations, play crucial roles in determining disease trajectory. This review explores the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying DCIS progression, with an emphasis on myoepithelial cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and microenvironmental factors. By integrating recent findings, this article aims to refine risk stratification approaches and guide future strategies for personalized DCIS management. Improved prognostic biomarkers and targeted therapeutic interventions could help optimize treatment decisions, balancing the need for effective cancer prevention while minimizing overtreatment in low-risk patients.

[PMID: 40155037] This review describes the histopathological and molecular features distinguishing high-risk ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS) from low-risk DCIS and their progression to invasive breast cancer (IBC). We summarize key alterations that occur in various compartments of the breast tissue such as myoepithelial cells, luminal epithelial cells, and the immune environment. Evidence suggests that DCIS and IBC share a largely similar genome, with comparable transcriptomes across various grades of DCIS and IBC. However, some studies report transcriptional up-regulation of multiple genes in luminal epithelial cells of high-risk DCIS. High-risk DCIS is also characterized by loss of genes that are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the myoepithelium, a physical barrier that keeps the cancer cells from invading surrounding tissue. High-grade DCIS is also characterized by global hypomethylation, but hypermethylation of select gene promoters also occurs. Immune environment changes that correlate with high-risk DCIS include overall increased T cell, B cell, and macrophage infiltration. Despite the active immune environment, these immune cells are in suppressed state and are characterized by increased presence of immunosuppressive Tregs, immunosuppressive M2, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), an immunophenotypic switch of fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and lesser amounts of protective cytotoxic T cells. Several long noncoding RNAs also play a role in driving the premalignant phenotypic changes in normal breast epithelial and DCIS cells. Further validating the ability of these prognostic biomarkers for predicting DCIS progression will help reduce overtreatment while effectively managing the patients with DCIS that are at high risk of progression to IBC.

[PMID: 40101158] Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a risk factor for subsequent invasive breast cancer (IBC). To identify events in DCIS that lead to invasive cancer, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on DCIS lesions and matched normal breast tissue. Inferred copy-number variation was used to identify neoplastic epithelial cells from clinical specimens, which contained a mixture of DCIS and normal ducts. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated intratumoral clonal heterogeneity that was associated with significant gene expression differences. Classification of epithelial cells into mammary cell states revealed that subclones contained a mixture of cell states, suggesting an ongoing pattern of differentiation after neoplastic transformation. Cell state proportions were significantly different based on estrogen receptor expression, with estrogen receptor-negative DCIS more closely resembling the distribution in the normal breast, particularly with respect to cells with basal characteristics. Specific alterations in cell state proportions were associated with progression to invasive cancer in a cohort of DCIS with longitudinal outcome. Ongoing transcription of key basement membrane (BM) genes occurred in specific subsets of epithelial cell states, including basal/myoepithelial, which are diminished in DCIS. In the transition to IBC, the BM protein laminin, but not COL4, was altered in DCIS adjacent to invasion. Loss of COL4, but not laminin, in an in vitro DCIS model led to an invasive phenotype. These findings suggest that the process of invasion is a loss-of-function event due to an imbalance in critical cell populations essential for BM integrity rather than a gain of an invasive phenotype by neoplastic cells. Single-cell analyses reveal ductal carcinoma in situ comprises multiple genetic clones with significant phenotypic diversity and link alterations in epithelial cell states and basement membrane integrity with invasive breast cancer progression.

[PMID: 39821028] Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for ~20% of all breast cancer diagnoses but whilst known to be a precursor of invasive breast cancer (IBC), evidence suggests only one in six patients will ever progress. A key challenge is to distinguish between those lesions that will progress and those that will remain indolent. Molecular analyses of neoplastic epithelial cells have not identified consistent differences between lesions that progressed and those that did not, and this has focused attention on the tumour microenvironment (ME).The DCIS ME is unique, complex and dynamic. Myoepithelial cells form the wall of the ductal-lobular tree and exhibit broad tumour suppressor functions. However, in DCIS they acquire phenotypic changes that bestow them with tumour promoter properties, an important evolution since they act as the primary barrier for invasion. Changes in the peri-ductal stromal environment also arise in DCIS, including transformation of fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs orchestrate other changes in the stroma, including the physical structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM) through altered protein synthesis, as well as release of a plethora of factors including proteases, cytokines and chemokines that remodel the ECM. CAFs can also modulate the immune ME as well as impact on tumour cell signalling pathways. The heterogeneity of CAFs, including recognition of anti-tumourigenic populations, is becoming evident, as well as heterogeneity of immune cells and the interplay between these and the adipocyte and vascular compartments. Knowledge of the impact of these changes is more advanced in IBC but evidence is starting to accumulate for a role in DCIS. Detailed in vitro, in vivo and tissue studies focusing on the interplay between DCIS epithelial cells and the ME should help to define features that can better predict DCIS behaviour.

[PMID: 39138514] A better understanding of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is urgently needed to identify these preinvasive lesions as distinct clinical entities. Semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F) is a soluble axonal guidance molecule, and its coreceptors Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and NRP2 are strongly expressed in invasive epithelial BC cells. We utilized two cell line models to represent the progression from a healthy state to the mild-aggressive or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) stage and, ultimately, to invasive cell lines. Additionally, we employed in vivo models and conducted analyses on patient databases to ensure the translational relevance of our results. We revealed SEMA3F as a promoter of invasion during the DCIS-to-invasive ductal carcinoma transition in breast cancer (BC) through the action of NRP1 and NRP2. In epithelial cells, SEMA3F activates epithelialmesenchymal transition, whereas it promotes extracellular matrix degradation and basal membrane and myoepithelial cell layer breakdown. Together with our patient database data, these proof-of-concept results reveal new SEMA3F-mediated mechanisms occurring in the most common preinvasive BC lesion, DCIS, and represent potent and direct activation of its transition to invasion. Moreover, and of clinical and therapeutic relevance, the effects of SEMA3F can be blocked directly through its coreceptors, thus preventing invasion and keeping DCIS lesions in the preinvasive state.

[PMID: 39072314] Ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS), characterized by a proliferation of neoplastic cells confined within the mammary ducts, is distinctly isolated from the surrounding stroma by an almost uninterrupted layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) and by the basement membrane. Heightened interactions within the adipose microenvironment, particularly in obese patients, may play a key role in the transition from DCIS to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), which is attracting growing interest in scientific research. Adipose tissue undergoes metabolic changes in obesity, impacting adipokine secretion and promoting chronic inflammation. This study aimed to assess the interactions between DCIS, including <i>in situ</i> cancer cells and MECs, and the various components of its inflammatory adipose microenvironment (adipocytes and macrophages). To this end, a 3D co-culture model was developed using bicellular bi-fluorescent DCIS-like tumoroids, adipose cells, and macrophages to investigate the influence of the inflammatory adipose microenvironment on DCIS progression. The 3D co-culture model demonstrated an inhibition of the expression of genes involved in apoptosis (<i>BAX, BAG1, BCL2, CASP3, CASP8</i>, and <i>CASP9</i>), and an increase in genes related to cell survival (<i>TP53</i>, <i>JUN</i>, and <i>TGFB1</i>), inflammation (<i>TNF-α, PTGS2, IL-6R</i>), invasion and metastasis (TIMP1 and MMP-9) in cancer cells of the tumoroids under inflammatory conditions versus a non-inflammatory microenvironment. On the contrary, it confirmed the compromised functionality of MECs, resulting in the loss of their protective effects against cancer cells. Adipocytes from obese women showed a significant increase in the expression of all studied myofibroblast-associated genes (myoCAFs), such as <i>FAP</i> and <i>α-SMA</i>. In contrast, adipocytes from normal-weight women expressed markers of inflammatory fibroblast phenotypes (iCAF) characterized by a significant increase in the expression of <i>LIF</i> and inflammatory cytokines such as <i>TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8</i>, and <i>CXCL-10</i>. These changes also influenced macrophage polarization, leading to a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. In contrast, myoCAF-associated adipocytes, and the cancer-promoting microenvironment polarized macrophages towards an M2 phenotype, characterized by high CD163 receptor expression and IL-10 and TGF-β secretion. Reciprocal interactions between the tumoroid and its microenvironment, particularly in obesity, led to transcriptomic changes in adipocytes and macrophages, may participate in breast cancer progression while disrupting the integrity of the MEC layer. These results underlined the importance of adipose tissue in cancer progression.

[PMID: 38766192] Ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS) constitutes an array of morphologically recognized intraductal neoplasms in the mammary ductal tree defined by an increased risk for subsequent invasive carcinomas at or near the site of biopsy detection. However, only 15-45% of untreated DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer, so understanding mechanisms that prevent progression is key to avoid overtreatment and provides a basis for alternative therapies and prevention. This study was designed to characterize the tumor microenvironment and molecular profile of high-risk DCIS that grew to a large size but remained as DCIS. All patients had DCIS lesions >5cm in size with at least one additional high-risk feature: young age (<45 years), high nuclear grade, hormone receptor negativity, HER2 positivity, the presence of comedonecrosis, or a palpable mass. The tumor immune microenvironment was characterized using multiplex immunofluorescence to identify immune cells and their spatial relationships within the ducts and stroma. Gene copy number analysis and whole exome DNA sequencing identified the mutational burden and driver mutations, and quantitative whole-transcriptome/gene expression analyses were performed. There was no association between the percent of the DCIS genome characterized by copy number variants (CNAs) and recurrence events (DCIS or invasive). Mutations, especially missense mutations, in the breast cancer driver genes <i>PIK3CA</i> and <i>TP53</i> were common in this high-risk DCIS cohort (47% of evaluated lesions). Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density was higher in DCIS lesions with TP53 mutations (p=0.0079) compared to wildtype lesions, but not in lesions with <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations (p=0.44). Immune infiltrates were negatively associated with hormone receptor status and positively associated with HER2 expression. High levels of CD3+CD8- T cells were associated with good outcomes with respect to any subsequent recurrence (DCIS or invasive cancer), whereas high levels of CD3+Foxp3+ Treg cells were associated with poor outcomes. Spatial proximity analyses of immune cells and tumor cells demonstrated that close proximity of T cells with tumor cells was associated with good outcomes with respect to any recurrence as well as invasive recurrences. Interestingly, we found that myoepithelial continuity (distance between myoepithelial cells surrounding the involved ducts) was significantly lower in DCIS lesions compared to normal tissue (p=0.0002) or to atypical ductal hyperplasia (p=0.011). Gene set enrichment analysis identified several immune pathways associated with low myoepithelial continuity and a low myoepithelial continuity score was associated with better outcomes, suggesting that gaps in the myoepithelial layer may allow access/interactions between immune infiltrates and tumor cells. Our study demonstrates the immune microenvironment of DCIS, in particular the spatial proximity of tumor cells and T cells, and myoepithelial continuity are important determinants for progression of disease.

[PMID: 37506511] The heterogeneous cell population in the stromal microenvironment is considered to be attributed to the multiple sources from which the cells originate. Tumor associated myoepithelial cells (TAMEs) are one of the most important populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) especially in breast cancer. On the other hand, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have previously been described to be the origin of tumor-associated cellular components in the TME. We prepared a cancer stem cell model converting mouse-induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) in the presence of conditioned medium of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells. The converted cells developed tumors progressing into invasive carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) like structure when transplanted into mouse mammary fat pads. The primary cultured cells from the tumor further exhibited markers of CSC such as Sox2, Oct3/4, - CD133 and EpCAM, and mammary gland-related TAME markers such as α-smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin 8, whey acidic protein, prolactin receptor and progesterone receptor as well. These results indicated that the CSCs could be an origin of TAMEs contributing to mammary gland epithelial cell differentiation and the progression to invasive carcinoma during tumor development. The gene expression profiles confirmed the enhanced signaling pathways of PI3K/AKT and MAPK, which have been demonstrated to be enriched in the CSC models, together with the estrogen receptor signaling which was peculiar to mammary gland-derived character.

[PMID: 37190184] In breast cancer, progression to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) involves interactions between immune, myoepithelial, and tumor cells. Development of IDC can proceed through ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-obligate, non-invasive stage, or IDC can develop without evidence of DCIS and these cases associate with poorer prognosis. Tractable, immune-competent mouse models are needed to help delineate distinct mechanisms of local tumor cell invasion and prognostic implications. To address these gaps, we delivered murine mammary carcinoma cell lines directly into the main mammary lactiferous duct of immune-competent mice. Using two strains of immune-competent mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6), one immune-compromised (severe combined immunodeficiency; SCID) C57BL/6 strain, and six different murine mammary cancer cell lines (D2.OR, D2A1, 4T1, EMT6, EO771, Py230), we found early loss of ductal myoepithelial cell differentiation markers p63, α-smooth muscle actin, and calponin, and rapid formation of IDC in the absence of DCIS. Rapid IDC formation also occurred in the absence of adaptive immunity. Combined, these studies demonstrate that loss of myoepithelial barrier function does not require an intact immune system, and suggest that these isogenic murine models may prove a useful tool to study IDC in the absence of a non-obligatory DCIS stage-an under-investigated subset of poor prognostic human breast cancer.

[PMID: 36946175] Recently, many types of 3D culture systems have been developed to preserve the physicochemical environment and biological characteristics of the original tumors better than the conventional 2D monolayer culture system. There are various types of models belonging to this culture, such as the culture based on non-adherent and/or scaffold-free matrices to form the tumors. Agarose mold has been widely used to facilitate tissue spheroid assembly, as it is essentially non-biodegradable, bio-inert, biocompatible, low-cost, and low-attachment material that can promote cell spheroidization. As no studies have been carried out on the development of a fluorescent bicellular tumoroid mimicking ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS) using human cell lines, our objective was to detail the practical approaches developed to generate this model, consisting of a continuous layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) around a previously formed <i>in situ</i> breast tumor. The practical approaches developed to generate a bi-cellular tumoroid mimicking ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS), consisting of a continuous layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) around a previously formed <i>in situ</i> breast tumoroid. Firstly, the optimal steps and conditions of spheroids generation using a non-adherent agarose gel were described, in particular, the appropriate medium, seeding density of each cell type and incubation period. Next, a lentiviral transduction approach to achieve stable fluorescent protein expression (integrative system) was used to characterize the different cell lines and to track tumoroid generation through immunofluorescence, the organization of the two cell types was validated, specific merits and drawbacks were compared to lentiviral transduction. Two lentiviral vectors expressing either EGFP (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) or m-Cherry (Red Fluorescent Protein) were used. Various rates of a multiplicity of infection (MOI) and multiple types of antibodies (anti-p63, anti-CK8, anti-Maspin, anti-Calponin) for immunofluorescence analysis were tested to determine the optimal conditions for each cell line. At MOI 40 (GFP) and MOI 5 (m-Cherry), the signals were almost homogeneously distributed in the cells which could then be used to generate the DCIS-like tumoroids. Images of the tumoroids in agarose molds were captured with a confocal microscope Micro Zeiss Cell Observer Spinning Disk or with IncuCyte® to follow the progress of the generation. Measurement of protumoral cytokines such as IL-6, IL8 and leptin confirmed their secretion in the supernatants, indicating that the properties of our cells were not altered. Finally the advantages and disadvantages of each fluorescent approach were discussed. This model could also be used for other solid malignancies to study the complex relationship between different cells such as tumor and myoepithelial cells in various microenvironments (inflammatory, adipose and tumor, obesity, <i>etc.</i>). Although, this new model is well established to monitor drug screening applications and perform pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses.",10

[PMID: 40174861] Systemic RV dysfunction is a significant prognostic factor in congenital heart disease, particularly affecting patients with transposition of the great arteries post-atrial switch and congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. These patients often experience chronic pressure loading conditions, leading to structural, mechanical, and electrical adaptations that can result in heart failure. This article reviews novel therapeutic approaches for managing systemic right ventricular failure in patients with adult congenital heart disease, focusing on pharmacologic, device-based, and advanced heart failure therapies. Traditional heart failure medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have shown mixed results in systemic right ventricular failure. However, newer agents like angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have demonstrated promising outcomes in improving cardiac remodeling and function. Cardiac resynchronization therapy has shown benefits in selected patients, particularly those with prior ventricular pacing. Mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation remain viable options for advanced heart failure, with recent studies indicating favourable long-term outcomes. The management of systemic right ventricular failure requires a personalized approach, considering the unique anatomic and physiological characteristics of each patient. Although traditional therapies have limited efficacy, novel pharmacologic and device-based treatments might offer new hope for this patient population. Further research is needed to refine these strategies and identify new therapeutic targets.

Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test and chi-square test were used for group comparisons.Multivariable Logistic regression was applied to identify factors influencing outcomes (in-hospital mortality and adverse cardiovascular events). <b>Results:</b> (1) From 1990 to 2021, the number of children with CHD and HF in China increased from 333 000 (95% uncertainty interval (<i>UI</i>) 271 000-405 000) to 368 000 (95%<i>UI</i> 296 000-459 000), a growth of 10.8% (95%<i>UI</i> 5.0%-16.6%). Concurrently the prevalence rate increased from 104.5 (95%<i>UI</i> 85.1-127.3) per 100 000 to 142.0 (95%<i>UI</i> 114.0-176.8) per 100 000, a growth of 35.9% (95%<i>UI</i> 28.7%-43.0%), with an EAPC of 1.5% (95%<i>CI</i> 1.2%-1.8%). Although the number of cases in the<1 year and 1-<2 years groups decreased by 41.0% and 25.6%, respectively, the prevalence in all age groups showed an upward trend:<1 year EAPC 0.6% (95%<i>CI</i> 0.5%-0.7%); 1-<2 years EAPC 0.9% (95%<i>CI</i> 0.8%-1.0%); 2-<5 years EAPC 1.2% (95%<i>CI</i> 1.0%-1.4%); 5-<10 years EAPC 1.5% (95%<i>CI</i> 1.2%-1.8%); 10-<15 years EAPC 2.1% (95%<i>CI</i> 1.9%-2.3%). (2) The multicenter study revealed that among 1 062 hospitalized children, 528 (49.7%) were male and 534 (50.3%) were female, with the age at admission of 5.4 (2.2,18.2) months. The majority of the children (77.9%, 827/1 062) were under 2 years of age, whereas 22.1% (235/1 062) were aged between 2-<18 years. Children with complex congenital heart defects accounted for the highest proportion (48.6%, 516/1 062), while those with isolated CHD made up 31.5% (335/1 062). Statistically significant differences were observed in several variables in demographics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes between the two age groups (all <i>P</i><0.05). The use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (41.1%, 436/1 062) and beta-blockers (8.7%, 92/1 062) was lower in hospitalized children with CHD and HF. Logistic regression identified complex CHD (<i>OR</i>=7.73, 95%<i>CI</i> 2.24-26.63; <i>OR</i>=3.17, 95%<i>CI</i> 1.92-5.23), pulmonary hyperperfusion (<i>OR</i>=2.15, 95%<i>CI</i> 1.01-4.18; <i>OR</i>=2.00, 95%<i>CI</i> 1.35-2.97), left ventricular ejection fraction<55% (<i>OR</i>=2.13, 95%<i>CI</i> 1.08-4.21; <i>OR</i>=2.80, 95%<i>CI</i> 1.45-5.56), arterial oxygen partial pressure (<i>OR</i>=0.99, 95%<i>CI</i> 0.98-0.99; <i>OR</i>=0.99, 95%<i>CI</i> 0.98-0.99), and serum calcium levels (<i>OR</i>=0.31, 95%<i>CI</i> 0.17-0.58; <i>OR</i>=0.42, 95%<i>CI</i> 0.28-0.62) as independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality and cardiovascular events. <b>Conclusions:</b> The disease burden of CHD combined with HF in China has shown a continuous upward trend from 1990 to 2021, with higher growth rates in older age groups. Complex CHD, pulmonary hyperperfusion, left ventricular ejection fraction <55%, arterial oxygen partial pressure, and serum calcium concentration are independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality and cardiovascular events.

[PMID: 39273041] Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be a major global health concern, representing a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. This review provides a comprehensive examination of CVDs, encompassing their pathophysiology, diagnostic biomarkers, advanced imaging techniques, pharmacological treatments, surgical interventions, and the emerging role of herbal remedies. The review covers various cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, peripheral artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular diseases, and congenital heart defects. The review presents a wide range of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins, C-reactive protein, CKMB, BNP, NT-proBNP, galectin, adiponectin, IL-6, TNF-α, miRNAs, and oxylipins. Advanced molecular imaging techniques, including chest X-ray, ECG, ultrasound, CT, SPECT, PET, and MRI, have significantly enhanced our ability to visualize myocardial perfusion, plaque characterization, and cardiac function. Various synthetic drugs including statins, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmics are fundamental in managing CVDs. Nonetheless, their side effects such as hepatic dysfunction, renal impairment, and bleeding risks necessitate careful monitoring and personalized treatment strategies. In addition to conventional therapies, herbal remedies have garnered attention for their potential cardiovascular benefits. Plant extracts and their bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, saponins, and alkaloids, offer promising cardioprotective effects and enhanced cardiovascular health. This review underscores the value of combining traditional and modern therapeutic approaches to improve cardiovascular outcomes. This review serves as a vital resource for researchers by integrating a broad spectrum of information on CVDs, diagnostic tools, imaging techniques, pharmacological treatments and their side effects, and the potential of herbal remedies.

[PMID: 37828735] BACKGROUND Decompensated heart failure (HF) is recognized as a significant prognostic factor for unfavorable outcomes in both the general population and adults with congenital heart diseases (ACHD). Among ACHD patients, those with advanced heart failure may be candidates for heart transplantation. However, in ACHD patients requiring heart surgery, even with reduced ejection fraction, the administration of appropriate medications can result in improved circulatory parameters, functional class, and surgical outcomes. CASE REPORT We present 5 patients who exhibited indications for open-heart surgery, advanced heart failure (HF) accompanied by congestion, and significant physical activity limitations or symptoms at rest (NYHA class III-IV). Among the patients, 40% were male, with a mean age of 47.4 years (ranging from 32 to 62 years). Three patients displayed reduced systemic ventricular ejection fraction, while 4 patients experienced arrhythmia. Congenital heart diseases (CHD) observed in the patients included repaired double-outlet right ventricle, congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, repaired tetralogy of Fallot, partial anomalous right pulmonary venous return, and atrial septal defect. Comprehensive heart failure medications were administered, including an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, levosimendan, beta-blockers, phosphocreatine, and diuretics. The preoperative period ranged from 8 days to 2 months. Notably, significant clinical and hemodynamic improvements were observed in all cases, and all open-heart surgeries were successfully completed. CONCLUSIONS Advanced and decompensated HF has a high impact on surgical outcomes. Preoperative care with prescribed medical management for ACHD patients is possible and provides good early and mid-term postoperative results.

[PMID: 35292147] Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a relatively newly diagnosed area, and evidence-based medicine (EBM) standards are emerging and currently include an aspirin, β blocker, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker for patients with hypertension, vascular abnormality imaging, and cardiac rehabilitation. Because SCAD is an uncommon condition, many providers are unfamiliar with EBM treatment standards which could affect the implementation of recommended treatment. This study documented the frequency of failure to meet EBM SCAD treatment standards and factors contributing to conformance failure. Patients who presented to a tertiary referral hospital from January 1, 2005, to July 6, 2020, were included. The electronic medical record was reviewed for EBM treatment. Patients who did not meet the criteria of EBM were contacted by phone for a phone interview. The study period included 118 patients with SCAD, 3 of whom (2.5%) died and were not eligible for this study. In the final cohort of 115 patients, the average age was 55 years, female gender (97%) and EBM standards were met in 30%. Of patients who participated in the phone interview, 38 (33%) reported frustration with SCAD misdiagnosis (39%), inadequate mental health resources (37%), and communication failure regarding the need for cardiologist follow-up (26%). Cardiac rehabilitation use was impacted by location, time of day, availability, and cost. The most common medication-limiting factor for β-blocker usage was fatigue (15%). Most (59%) patients did not undergo fibromuscular dysplasia imaging. In conclusion, in this 15-year SCAD study from a single tertiary care hospital SCAD registry, only 30% met the current EBM for SCAD. Unique solutions that are both patient-informed and evidence-driven are needed to achieve the best clinical outcomes.

[PMID: 34233773] In patients with right ventricular diastolic dysfunction after complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot, some employ the use of beta-blockade. The theoretical benefit of this therapy is felt to be one of the two: 1) reduction in heart rate with subsequent increase in diastolic filling time and stroke volume; 2) halting or reversal of right ventricular remodelling. This study aimed to characterise the use of beta-blockade in paediatric admissions with complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot and characterise the effects of beta-blockade on admission characteristics. Admissions from 2004 to 2015 in the Pediatric Health Information System database with complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot were identified. Characteristics between admissions with and without beta-blockade were compared by univariate analysis. Next, regression analyses were conducted to determine the independent association of beta-blockade on length of admission, billed charges, cardiac arrest, and inpatient mortality while controlling for demographic variables and comorbidities. A total of 3594 admissions were included in the final analyses. Of these, 371 employed beta-blockade. Admissions with beta-blockade were more likely to have heart failure and tachyarrhythmias. These admissions also tended to be longer by univariate analysis. Regression analyses demonstrated that beta-blockade was independently associated with a 2.8-day increase in length of stay and no statistically significant change in billed charges, cardiac arrest, or inpatient mortality. Beta-blockade after complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot is associated with a longer length of stay but did not statistically significantly impact billed charges, cardiac arrest, or inpatient mortality.

[PMID: 32468142] Serial changes of electrocardiograms (ECG) could be used to assess their clinical features in atrial septal defects (ASD) after transcatheter closure together with other clinical parameters. We retrospectively studied 100 ASD patients who underwent transcatheter closure. Complications of persistent atrial fibrillation occurred in five ASD patients, and they were excluded. We divided the other 95 patients according to PQ intervals before closure (normal: < 200 ms, n = 51; prolonged: ≥ 200 ms, n = 44) to evaluate their clinical characteristics and parameters such as echocardiography, chest X-rays, and brain natriuretic protein (BNP) levels. Individuals in the prolonged PQ group were significantly older, had higher incidences of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and heart failure (HF) treated with more β-blockers and diuretics, and with a higher tendency of NYHA functional classification and BNP levels than the normal PQ group. The prolonged PQ group also had a significantly higher incidence of complete right bundle branch block, wider QRS intervals, and larger cardiothoracic ratios in chest X-rays accompanied by larger right atrial-areas and larger left atrial dimensions in echocardiograms. Furthermore, the prolonged PQ intervals with less PQ interval shortening after transcatheter closure revealed that the patients were the oldest at the time of closures and showed less structural normalization of the right heart and left atrium after ASD closure. PAF and HF also occurred more frequently in this subgroup. These results suggested that the ASD patients with prolonged PQ intervals with less PQ shortening were accompanied by more advanced clinical conditions. Together with other clinical parameters, detailed analyses of ECG and their changes after closure could elucidate the clinical characteristics and status of ASD patients with transcatheter closure and were useful for predicting structural normalization after transcatheter closure.

[PMID: 32274953] <i>Objective:</i> Congenitally corrected and surgical atrial redirected transposition of the great arteries (TGA) represents states where the morphological right ventricle serves as a systemic ventricle (S-RV). The S-RV is prone to failure, but data on medical treatment on this problem is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the survival in adults with S-RV, with or without heart failure treatment. <i>Design:</i> The SWEDCON registry was used to collect data. All adults with S-RV and minimum follow-up of 1 year were included retrospectively. Medical treatment was defined as taking beta-blockers and/or ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs for more than 50% of the time. <i>Results:</i> We identified 343 patients with S-RV (median age: 21 years). Surgical atrial redirected TGA was present in 58% and congenitally corrected TGA in 42% of patients. The medically treated group (<i>n</i> = 126) had higher rates of impaired S-RV function, use of diuretics, pacemaker and higher NYHA functional class at baseline compared to controls. The proportion of patients with impaired functional class did not change over time in the medically treated group, but increased in controls (21% vs. 30%, <i>p</i> = .015). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the mean follow-up was 10.3 years, no difference in survival was seen between the groups. <i>Conclusions:</i> Medical treatment may be beneficial in patients with S-RV and impaired functional class and appears to be safe in the long term. The treatment group had equal survival to controls, despite worse baseline characteristics, which might be a result of slower progression of disease in this group.

[PMID: 31476817] We report the case of a 44 year-old patient with complex ACHD, admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in hemodynamic profile B. He had a single ventricle with pulmonary atresia, previously submitted to three modified Blalock-Taussig shunts (mBTs) at the age of 2, 12 and 19 years old. Despite conventional treatment with diuretics, β-blockers (BB) and isosorbide dinitrate the patient progressed to profile C and the transthoracic echocardiogram disclosed a reduced systolic function. Likewise, levosimendan was commenced and an appropriate decongestion and a marked reduction in the NT-proBNP were seen. Treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, BB, ivabradine and mineralocorticoid receptor was optimized. The patient was discharged home after 26 days in NYHA class III and referred for heart transplant after right heart catheterization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful levosimendan's use in ADHF in a mBTs long-term survivor.",10
"In young and middle-aged adults, current or remote uses of ADHD medications increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events.",ADHD medications AND serious cardiovascular events AND young adult cardiovascular risk AND ADHD medication effects on heart,"22161946,41187125,41185875,41185422,41184894,41183861,41183543,41182792,41182374,41181844","[PMID: 22161946] More than 1.5 million US adults use stimulants and other medications labeled for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These agents can increase heart rate and blood pressure, raising concerns about their cardiovascular safety. To examine whether current use of medications prescribed primarily to treat ADHD is associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events in young and middle-aged adults. Retrospective, population-based cohort study using electronic health care records from 4 study sites (OptumInsight Epidemiology, Tennessee Medicaid, Kaiser Permanente California, and the HMO Research Network), starting in 1986 at 1 site and ending in 2005 at all sites, with additional covariate assessment using 2007 survey data. Participants were adults aged 25 through 64 years with dispensed prescriptions for methylphenidate, amphetamine, or atomoxetine at baseline. Each medication user (n = 150,359) was matched to 2 nonusers on study site, birth year, sex, and calendar year (443,198 total users and nonusers). Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death (SCD), or stroke, with comparison between current or new users and remote users to account for potential healthy-user bias. During 806,182 person-years of follow-up (median, 1.3 years per person), 1357 cases of MI, 296 cases of SCD, and 575 cases of stroke occurred. There were 107,322 person-years of current use (median, 0.33 years), with a crude incidence per 1000 person-years of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.14-1.57) for MI, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.20-0.42) for SCD, and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.43-0.72) for stroke. The multivariable-adjusted rate ratio (RR) of serious cardiovascular events for current use vs nonuse of ADHD medications was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72-0.96). Among new users of ADHD medications, the adjusted RR was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63-0.94). The adjusted RR for current use vs remote use was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.86-1.24); for new use vs remote use, the adjusted RR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.82-1.28); the upper limit of 1.28 corresponds to an additional 0.19 events per 1000 person-years at ages 25-44 years and 0.77 events per 1000 person-years at ages 45-64 years. Among young and middle-aged adults, current or new use of ADHD medications, compared with nonuse or remote use, was not associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events. Apparent protective associations likely represent healthy-user bias.

[PMID: 41187125] Previous reports have noted associations between infertility in women and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in later life. However, reports conflict regarding the associations between infertility and CVD risk factors. Using data from a population-based cohort of Black and White women, we examined the association between longitudinal assessments of CVD risk factors and infertility. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a prospective cohort of Black and White women who have undergone repeated assessment of CVD risk factors beginning at study baseline (1985-1986). Risk factors included cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid levels, glucose, and C-reactive protein. At approximately 40 years of age, an ancillary study assessed histories of infertility. We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link model to examine associations between infertility (dependent variable) and repeated CVD risk factors (independent variables), with adjustment for age, race, center, and education level in 1107 women. Cigarette use and higher levels of BMI, glucose, and triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) were associated with infertility after adjustment for age, race, and education. Cigarette use had the strongest associations with self-reported infertility in multivariable models (odds ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.64, 2.14). Women with infertility histories have adverse CVD risk factors across the reproductive lifespan, but cigarette use is the primary CVD risk factor for women's self-reported infertility.

[PMID: 41185875] Objectives Medical students are a high-risk group for mental health conditions. There is a paucity of research within Caribbean medical schools on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition estimated to affect approximately one in 20 adults. The purpose of this research was to determine the prevalence of ADHD-related symptoms and their associated factors affecting attention span among medical students. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a conveniently selected group of currently enrolled medical students in the Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medical Sciences (FMS) of The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus, in Trinidad and Tobago, between January and June 2024. Participants completed an online questionnaire. The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess ADHD, sleep quality, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Attention spans and lifestyle factors influencing attention were also evaluated. Statistical analyses were done for predictors of ADHD and factors affecting attention span using logistic regression-derived odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence limits. Results Out of 231 respondents, the mean age was 22.6 years (SD 2.3), with 72.3% identifying as female. The overall prevalence of a positive ADHD screen was 45%, showing no significant association with age (<i>P</i> = 0.148) or gender (<i>P</i> = 0.788). ADHD positivity was highest in Year 3 (67.3%), significantly greater than Year 1 (OR 3.66, 95% CI 1.62-8.29, <i>P</i> = 0.002). High rates of poor sleep quality (82.3%), anxiety (65.4%), and depression (73.2%) were observed, all of which were positively correlated with ADHD (<i>P</i> ≤ 0.001). The top five factors affecting attention span included tiredness/energy level (91.3%), academic load (80.1%), sleep quality (79.2%), interest in the subject (78.4%), and time of day (78.4%). Students with ADHD symptoms reported higher levels of exercise, social media usage, caffeine consumption, breakfast skipping, and fluid intake compared to non-ADHD peers (<i>P</i> < 0.05 for all). Conclusions The study highlights a high prevalence of ADHD-related symptoms and mental health comorbidities among medical students, emphasizing the need for curriculum review and enhanced support services.

[PMID: 41185422] Conduct disorder and childhood head injuries frequently co-occur and are linked to a higher risk of later delinquency. While both are known to disrupt reward-related neural circuits, this study investigated whether their combined presence leads to a unique disruption in these pathways, potentially accounting for the increased risk of delinquency. Using neuroimaging data from the baseline (age 9-10) assessment from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, four groups were compared: children with conduct disorder (CD, <i>n</i> = 588), a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, <i>n</i> = 1,216), both (mTBI+CD, <i>n</i> = 252), and typically developing controls (TD, <i>n</i> = 705). Neural activation in eight regions of interest (amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, caudal anterior cingulate cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, and insula) during reward anticipation and receipt were assessed during the monetary incentive delay task. After controlling for several covariates, including sex, ADHD, and internalizing problems, the mTBI+CD group displayed greater left amygdala and hippocampal activation during reward receipt compared to all other groups. While they displayed increased activation in the right hippocampus and thalamus compared to TD controls and the right hippocampus compared to the mTBI group, they did not differ from the CD group. No group differences emerged during reward anticipation. Increased left amygdala and hippocampus activation in children with conduct disorder and a history of mild traumatic brain injury may reflect robust encoding of emotionally charged reward experiences, potentially reinforcing memory-guided, reward-seeking behaviors.

[PMID: 41184894] In Nigeria, cardiovascular diseases, especially hypertension, are on the rise. This increase in hypertension correlates with more strokes, significantly impacting mortality. Since hypertension often persists into adulthood, early interventions are crucial to prevent its complications. Non-invasive methods, such as music and creative activities, can effectively improve blood pressure and reduce stroke risk. This study aims to improve intergenerational awareness of hypertension and promote sustainable preventive practices by involving youth and caregivers within families and communities. We employed a participatory, observational design, incorporating a five-month crowdsourcing open call followed by a designathon event. Participatory social and health innovations were combined and implemented as part of a larger study titled ""Innovative Tool to Expand Music-Inspired Strategies for Blood Pressure and Stroke Prevention"" (I-TEST BP/Stroke). Our study targeted youths aged 14 to 24, a critical period for shaping health behaviors and attitudes toward diseases. The 20 finalist textual entries were categorized into themes using the PEN-3 cultural model. The PLAN framework analyzed the effectiveness of participants' entries in conveying public health messages. The crowdsourced open call for musical ideas received 85 submissions between October 2023 and March 2024. More males (74.3%) than females, mainly aged 22-24, and mostly undergraduates (44.3%), participated in the open call, with 88.65% having heard of hypertension. Qualitative analysis with PEN-3 highlighted themes regarding Perceptions and Enablers, such as monitoring blood pressure, engaging in physical activity, and avoiding alcohol and smoking. The use of Pidgin English and Nigerian languages in songs represents Positive Cultural Empowerment. The Negative Cultural Empowerment domain addresses misconceptions about hypertension, including the belief that hypertension is a curse. Utilizing the PLAN framework, the submissions demonstrated an effective blend of catchy, memorable tunes with health education messages. The designathon produced various music genres, including afrobeats, rap, and R&B, with lyrics deemed feasible and socio-culturally appropriate. This suggests that music interventions tailored to Nigeria could enhance public awareness of hypertension and stroke prevention if scaled up.

[PMID: 41183861] Optimal neurodevelopment during pregnancy is crucial for healthy brain functioning for a lifetime, which can prevent the risk of adverse outcomes like autism, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mental health issues, or learning disabilities. Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) is one of the conditions leading to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the newborn. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the existing evidence on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with IUGR and highlight critical knowledge gaps, emphasizing the need for long-term standardized studies. A systematic literature search was conducted across Medline/PubMed, Embase, and Scopus up to June 2025 as per the eligibility criteria, including systematic reviews on neurodevelopmental outcomes in IUGR children diagnosed as per the Delphi criteria. The extracted articles underwent study selection and data extraction processes, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. The eligible articles were synthesized qualitatively and presented. Eight eligible studies were included in this review; two included meta-analyses, and six had only qualitative synthesis. Qualitative narrative synthesis was conducted for these eight studies. The included studies were of moderate quality and consistently reported that IUGR children exhibited significantly lower cognitive, motoric, and linguistic scores than their Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA) peers. Some noted specific impairments included reduced Intelligence Quotient (IQ), fine and gross motor delays, and language comprehension deficits. While some studies showed insignificant differences in behavioral or language outcomes, others linked biomarkers like S100B, Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE), and tau proteins to substandard neurodevelopment. Adverse neurological outcomes and neurodevelopmental impairment were associated with IUGR. Protective brain-sparing effects might pose benefits early in life, which may not persist throughout. IUGR children are at an elevated risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, specifically in cognitive and motor domains. While language and behavioral findings vary, early life impairments are notable. The heterogeneity in the methodologies across the included primary studies highlights the need for standardized research, diagnostic criteria, and longitudinal studies to extract definitive conclusions. Extensive neurodevelopmental monitoring, timely interventions, and further exploration of predictive biomarkers are essential to optimize outcomes and mitigate long-term adverse effects in this vulnerable population.

[PMID: 41183543] Attention deficit-/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications are commonly prescribed to children and adolescents, but therapeutic reference ranges have not been systematically evaluated yet. This study aimed to establish preliminary therapeutic reference ranges for methylphenidate (MPH), <i>d</i>-amphetamine (<i>d</i>-AMP), atomoxetine (ATX), and guanfacine (GFC), based on a systematic review of the existing relevant literature.Therapeutic reference ranges were calculated based on blood concentrations measured in responder children and adolescents with ADHD. Therapeutic ranges were determined both as mean values plus one standard deviation (SD) and using the 25<sup>th</sup>/75<sup>th</sup> IQRs. For MPH, a therapeutic reference range was calculated according to the mean maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>)±SD (8.8±7.7 ng/mL) as 1.1-16.6 ng/mL and according to the 25<sup>th</sup>/75<sup>th</sup> IQR as 7.2-11.3 ng/mL. The mean <i>d</i>-AMP C<sub>max</sub> concentration±SD was 31.9±15.2 ng/mL, resulting in a range of 16.6-47.1 ng/mL, and the calculated range according to IQR 25<sup>th</sup>/75<sup>th</sup> was 18.4-32.5 ng/mL. For ATX, mean maximum concentration at steady state (C<sub>max,ss</sub>)±SD was 589.7±656.3 ng/mL, resulting in a range of 0.0-1245.9 ng/mL, and according to 25<sup>th</sup>/75<sup>th</sup> IQR, the range was calculated as 537.0-635.5 ng/mL. For GFC, only one study was eligible, with a mean blood concentration of 7.5 ng/mL in responders.The results provide preliminary recommendations that can serve as reference values for therapeutic drug monitoring in children and adolescents treated with MPH, AMP, ATX, and GFC. Further research is needed to validate or refine the proposed therapeutic ranges.

[PMID: 41182792] Neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) are common, lifelong conditions that typically manifest during childhood. Cumulatively, approximately 15% of children globally have an NDC. NDCs have been associated with increased mortality risk, although extant literature pertains mostly to adults or to specific NDCs. To assess the mortality risk for youth aged 0 to 24 years with and without NDCs, for specific NDC groups, and by sex. A national 15-year birth cohort study of 888 975 youth from 1995 to 2009 in Aotearoa New Zealand. Cox proportional hazard models compared mortality risk after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Statistical analysis was conducted from August 17, 2024, to August 27, 2025. Youth with NDCs. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome, with medical, injury, and suicide cause-specific mortality as secondary outcomes. Of the 888 975 youths in the birth cohort, NDCs were identified in 40 071 (4.5%) (mean [SD] age at NDC diagnosis of 8.5 [4.6] years; 10 605 [26.5%] were female). Mortality risk was significantly higher for youth with NDCs compared with those without NDCs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 4.67 [95% CI, 4.13-5.28]) and higher for female individuals with NDCs compared with female individuals without NDCs (aHR, 9.69 [95% CI, 7.93-11.84]). Mortality risk was higher for all specific NDCs, including specific learning and motor disorders (aHR, 8.50 [95% CI, 7.11-10.16]), intellectual disability (aHR, 8.27 [95% CI, 6.92-9.89]), communication and language disorders (aHR, 6.06 [95% CI, 4.14-8.86]), autism (aHR, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.94-3.42]), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (aHR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.67-2.54]) compared with those without these respective conditions. Cause-specific mortality risk for those with any NDC was notably higher for medical-related deaths (aHR, 12.13 [95% CI, 10.31-14.28]) but also significantly higher for injury (aHR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.42-2.48]) and suicide (aHR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.21-2.37]) compared with those without NDCs. This population-level birth cohort study revealed a significantly higher mortality risk among youth with NDCs, especially female individuals, and marked variation in mortality risk by NDC diagnosis. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted health care interventions, improved access to medical and mental health services, and systemic changes to address the social and structural barriers that contribute to health inequities.

[PMID: 41182374] Psychostimulants have been recommended as first-line therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and safety concerns related to cardiovascular events in psychostimulant users have attracted increasing attention. However, evidence remains limited regarding the cardiovascular risks associated with methylphenidate use in children and adolescents who have heart disease or a family history of cardiovascular conditions. We conducted a self-controlled case series (SCCS) study using Taiwan's nationwide insurance database (2004-2021), which links data from births registered in the National Health Insurance system. A total of 2,493 individuals with ADHD, at least one methylphenidate prescription, and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) were enrolled. A stratified Cox regression model adjusted for time-varying confounders was used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of arrhythmias, ischaemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease during methylphenidate exposure compared with those during unexposed periods. Effect modification by congenital heart disease and family history of CVD was also assessed. We found a significantly increased risk of arrhythmias during both the exposed period (RR: 1.41, 95% CI (Confidence Interval): 1.21-1.63) and the pre-exposed period (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.15-1.96). No significant association was observed between methylphenidate use and the risk of ischaemic heart disease (RR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.49-1.50) or cerebrovascular disease (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.45-1.39). A family history of CVD did not affect cardiovascular risk. However, individuals with congenital heart diseases had an elevated risk of arrhythmias during the pre-exposed period (RR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.47-6.94) but not during the exposed period. These findings suggest that methylphenidate use is not significantly associated with ischaemic heart disease or cerebrovascular events in ADHD youth, even those with a family history of CVD or congenital heart diseases. The relationship between methylphenidate and the increased risk of arrhythmias during both the exposed and pre-exposed periods needs further investigation.

[PMID: 41181844] Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder that is characterized by progressive synovial inflammation and leads to joint destruction, functional decline, and reduced life expectancy. Although tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFi) have revolutionized RA management by preventing structural damage, their safety profiles remain controversial. Current safety assessments remain fragmented across isolated meta-analyses, failing to address competing risks or incorporate recent pharmacovigilance data. This study compared the adverse effects of anti-TNF therapy in RA and provided a stratified safety profile for optimal treatment selection. The research team searched four databases, namely PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, for relevant articles published from January 2000 to March 2025. The review adhered rigorously to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. For each meta-analysis, we recalculated effect sizes as either odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR) or standardized mean differences (SMD), accompanied by their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Methodological quality of included meta-analyses was evaluated with A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), while the certainty of evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. To address potential overlap among primary studies across meta-analyses, the investigators utilized the Graphical Representation of Overlap for Overviews (GROOVE) tool, followed by classification of the synthesized evidence into four levels based on predefined criteria. This umbrella review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42025638409). We synthesized results from 12 meta-analyses. The result indicated that TNF-α inhibitor therapy in RA patients was associated with (a) significantly increased risk of serious infection (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.31, 2.04, p < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 3%); (b) reduced risks of all cardiovascular events (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.89, p = 0.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 54%), myocardial infarction (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.98, p = 0.03, I<sup>2</sup> = 29%); and insulin resistance (SMD = -0.82, 95% CI: -1.38, -0.25, p < 0.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 92%). However, no significant associations were observed for malignant tumors (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.79, p = 0.30, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) or insulin sensitivity (SMD = 1.31, 95% CI: -0.34, 2.96, p < 0.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 93%). Substantial heterogeneity existed in all main analyses. TNF-α inhibitors are potentially associated with a higher risk of serious infection, while may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction and insulin resistance but no association was found with other indications. However, the inconsistent methodological across studies reduces statistical power and limits the reliability of these findings, which must be interpreted cautiously.

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187378] The high moisture content and perishability of the mulberry fruit restrict its high-value utilization. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) were extracted from mulberries using ultrasound-assisted acid, alkali, and enzymatic extraction processes. The structural and functional characteristics were systematically analyzed. The highest yield of SDF (23.61 %) obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction. Structural analysis showed that both IDF and SDF had a loose and porous structure with several exposed functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Functional experiments showed that IDF exhibited superior cholesterol- and nitrite-adsorption capacities compared with SDF. IDF and SDF obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities for glucose, cholesterol, and nitrite. In conclusion, ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction simultaneously enhances both the yield and functional properties of dietary fiber extracted from mulberry, providing an effective strategy for developing high-value functional ingredients and promoting sustainable utilization of the fruit.

[PMID: 41187375] To compare cost-effectiveness of targeted therapeutic strategies for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHB) patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage endometrial cancer. A Markov-based cost-utility model using a third-party payer perspective compared concurrent and maintenance treatment strategies incorporating dostarlimab and trastuzumab for newly diagnosed stage III-IV endometrial cancer: chemotherapy alone; 3 universal immunotherapy strategies (universal concurrent and maintenance dostarlimab +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu-positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas); and 3 targeted immunotherapy strategies (dostarlimab for mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas). Costs (2024 USD), utilities, and clinical estimates were derived from published literature and the National Cancer Database. The base case analysis was a microsimulation with 10,000 runs, accompanied by a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 20,000 trials. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We performed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses on key parameters and analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. All targeted immunotherapy strategies were cost-effective compared to chemotherapy alone in both NHB and NHW, while universal immunotherapy was never cost-effective. Targeted strategies were more cost-effective in NHB than NHW. Targeted dostarlimab for dMMR plus trastuzumab for HER2 serous and carcinosarcomas was the most cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy, with an ICER of $119,945/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, assuming longer durations of treatment benefit resulted in lower ICERs. Personalized treatment strategies incorporating HER2 and MMR testing should be considered to optimize both cost-effectiveness and equity in care.

[PMID: 41187366] The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, primarily through mechanisms involving carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Aberrant FGFR1 signalling has been implicated in various cancers, including lung, breast, neck and urothelial carcinoma. Despite the recognized oncogenic potential of FGFR1, therapeutic strategies targeting its kinase domain remain inadequately explored. This underscores an urgent need for the development of novel FGFR1 inhibitors, particularly through de novo drug design approaches, to effectively counteract FGFR1-driven malignancies. This research aims to develop novel FGFR1 inhibitors through a multi-step approach involving fragment-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and density functional theory studies (DFT), with the goal of targeting FGFR1's kinase binding domain to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Initially, known FGFR inhibitor molecules were retrieved and subjected to fragment-based drug designing and virtual screening. Through thorough analysis, molecules containing the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold were identified as promising candidates. A pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based database containing 90,952 molecules was subsequently retrieved from PubChem and filtered using molecular docking-based virtual screening resulting 94 molecules having better binding affinity than derazantinib, reference drug. After pharmacokinetic profiling (ADME), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) studies, out of 94 molecules only 11 compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and superior MM-GBSA binding free energies were selected. Docking-based screening revealed that selected 11 compounds demonstrated better binding scores than the reference drug, derazantinib. Among them, HIT1, was selected for 150ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess its conformational stability. DFT calculations further confirmed its bio-feasibility by analyzing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Overall, the selected lead compounds exhibited enhanced binding affinity, superior conformational stability, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to derazantinib. Present findings suggest that the identified hit molecules hold strong potential for inhibiting FGFR1's kinase domain and disrupting FGFR-associated tumor angiogenesis.

[PMID: 41187361] To explore the mechanism of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa on the accumulation of γ-glutamyl peptides and taste development in Jinhua ham, the influences of R. mucilaginosa on fungal community structure, functional enzyme gene expression, key enzyme activities, γ-glutamyl peptides accumulation and taste attributes were investigated during the dry-ripening. In comparison with Pichia kudriavzevii XS-5 (PK), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa XZY63-3 (RX) and no inoculation (CK), the inoculation with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa EIODSF019 (RE) showed the highest overall acceptance and richness. Metagenomics revealed that RE inoculation inhibited Aspergillus abundance, and the profile of Rhodotorula reached 45.94 % at genus level. The treatment of RE increased the gene abundance of amino acid metabolism pathways; the expression levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase gene in RE were increased by 83.27 % compared with CK, and the activities of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase increased from 214 U/g proteins of CK to 567 U/g proteins of RE. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the total contents of γ-glutamyl peptides increased from 136.40 μg/g of CK to 518.18 μg/g of RE. Partial least squares regression and correlation analysis indicated that γ-Glu-Cys and γ-Glu-Gln were mainly responsible for the improvement of overall acceptance and richness of Jinhua ham with RE inoculation.

[PMID: 41187357] To examine relationships among caregiver burden, parenting competence, and related factors in parents providing home-based care for children with medical complexity. We used a descriptive correlational, cross-sectional design and conducted path analysis. Convenience sampling was employed via pediatric visiting nurse stations in Kyoto and Shiga, Japan. Self-administered questionnaires were returned by 91 parents. The short version of the Japanese version of the Zarit Burden Interview and the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale were used. Analyses were performed in SPSS v29 and AMOS v29. After assessing all variable correlations, a path analysis was conducted to examine the direct and indirect effects of caregiver burden, parenting satisfaction, self-efficacy, and related variables. Caregiver burden negatively influenced parenting satisfaction (β = -0.383, p < .001) and was associated with inadequate rest (β = -0.271, p = .006) and shorter sleep duration (β = -0.228, p = .021). Higher medical complexity scores predicted greater parenting satisfaction (β = 0.202, p = .024) but were correlated with providing nighttime care (r = 0.275, p < .001), which reduced sleep duration. Model fit was adequate (goodness-of-fit index = 0.879; comparative fit index = 0.918; root mean square error of approximation = 0.043). Caregiver burden was a key factor affecting parenting competence among parents. Interventions aimed at reducing caregiver burden, such as facilitating adequate sleep and rest, may enhance their parenting competence. Future studies should recruit larger and more diverse samples and use longitudinal designs to increase generalizability and clarify temporal relationships.

[PMID: 41187332] The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) compared with anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and its impact on the primary prevention of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Patients with non-valvular AF and high thromboembolic risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc > 2 points) were included. LAAO was compared against the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 11, 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-E, while statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.4.1. A total of 10 studies with 5,779 patients were analyzed (2,916 with LAAO and 2,863 with anticoagulation). LAAO reduced, though without statistical significance, the incidence of ischemic stroke (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09). However, it showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the overall anticoagulant group (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.80; p = 0.0004). LAAO emerges as a viable strategy to reduce mortality in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, particularly when long-term anticoagulation is not feasible. Its superiority over DOACs and comparable profile to VKAs, along with the absence of periodic INR monitoring and relevant drug interactions, make it an option that may optimize adherence and quality of life.

[PMID: 41187326] This study aimed to develop a novel and efficient digital workflow for designing and manufacturing 3D-printed definitive maxillofacial obturator prostheses based on multi-source data fusion and various digital techniques, as well as to evaluate its feasibility through a randomized self-controlled study. Participants with maxillary defects were recruited for the study. A digital impression was obtained by fusing intraoral scanning data and computed tomography (CT) images. The framework and artificial-teeth-obturator were designed separately using multiple dental design software programs, fabricated through additive manufacturing (AM), and finally assembled precisely into one unit with the help of specially designed auxiliary positioning and connecting structures. For comparison, a conventional prosthesis was also made for each participant. The adaptation of both conventional and digital prostheses was evaluated and compared using the silicone rubber lining method through deviation analysis. Additionally, the chairside impression time for both conventional and digital treatments were recorded and compared. The digital workflow for designing and manufacturing maxillofacial prosthesis was successfully realized. The chairside impression time was shortened (p < 0.001). The adaptation of the digital prosthesis, including framework (349.89 ± 121.56 µm), obturator (420.08 ± 166.01 µm), and the whole prosthesis (408.36 ± 118.05 µm), proved suitable for clinical application. No statistically significant difference was observed between the digital and conventional prostheses. The newly established digital workflow for the fabrication of definitive maxillofacial obturator prostheses reduced chairside impression time and the number of appointments, featuring clinically acceptable adaptation. This approach has potential for future applications in the treatment of patients with maxillofacial defects.

[PMID: 41187324] The relationship between tooth color selection and individual satisfaction remains critical in dental esthetics. This study developed a hybrid approach combining deep learning with Bayesian network analysis to investigate how skin tone, age, and gender influence tooth color preferences. A total of 128 participants (62 males, 66 females; mean age 32.4 ± 7.8 years) evaluated 16 standardized smile images with different VITA classical shades. Participants included 60 dental professionals and 68 non-dental individuals. A hybrid model integrating convolutional neural networks with Bayesian networks was constructed to analyze color preferences. The model was validated through leave-one-out cross-validation and compared with traditional Bayesian analysis. The hybrid model achieved superior prediction accuracy (89.2%) compared to traditional Bayesian networks (82.5%, p < 0.01). B1, A1, and B2 shades received the highest overall ratings (8.63 ± 0.92, 8.21 ± 1.04, 7.85 ± 1.12, respectively). Males showed stronger preference for B1 shade (8.92 ± 0.78 vs. 8.37 ± 0.96 for females, p = 0.003), while females demonstrated more diverse preferences across multiple shades. Age negatively correlated with preference for lighter shades (r = -0.42, p < 0.001). Dental professionals exhibited greater discrimination between shades compared to non-dental participants (score range: 2.14-9.03 vs. 3.56-8.42, p < 0.01). This novel hybrid framework significantly improved tooth color prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods. The findings provide quantitative guidance for personalized shade selection based on individual characteristics, potentially enhancing clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction in esthetic dentistry.",10

Assess HF awareness, test associations with antihypertensive medication adherence, and self-efficacy for managing chronic conditions. We conducted a cross-sectional, observational survey research study. We leveraged data from participants enrolled in the American Heart Association's Research Goes Red™ registry, an online platform powered by Verily. Three surveys ascertained HF awareness, blood pressure management, and self-efficacy. Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank sum determined associations between survey domains and participant characteristics. Two thousand three hundred twenty women took the HF awareness survey, 678 the blood pressure management survey, and 755 the self-efficacy survey (response rates: 12%, 78%, and 76%, respectively). Participants were predominantly non-Hispanic White (78%), with a median age of 51 (interquartile range (IQR): 39, 62). Median HF awareness score was 4/5 (IQR: 4, 5). Participants with high HF awareness versus low were more likely to be older (<i>p</i> < 0.001), non-Hispanic White (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and less likely to smoke (<i>p</i> < 0.001) or have depression (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Nearly 90% of hypertensive participants reported medication adherence, which was not associated with HF awareness or self-efficacy. Participants with greater self-efficacy versus less were more likely to have higher HF awareness (<i>p</i> = 0.01), be older (<i>p</i> = 0.01), and less likely to have depression (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Women's awareness of HF and adherence to antihypertensive medication in this cohort was high. Depression and younger age may be important factors affecting women's HF awareness and confidence in managing chronic disease medication plans.

[PMID: 30646164] Having a child with a major birth defect can be a life-changing and stressful event that may be associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet the long-term burden of CVD for the child's mother is unknown. To assess whether mothers of an infant born with a major congenital anomaly are at higher risk of CVD compared with a comparison cohort. A population-based cohort study using individual-level linked registry data in Denmark included 42 943 women who gave birth to an infant with a major congenital anomaly between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 2013; and follow-up was conducted until 2015. A comparison group, comprising 428 401 randomly selected women, was 10:1 matched to each affected mother by maternal age, parity, and her infant's year of birth. Data analyses were performed between November 1, 2017, and February 28, 2018. Live birth of an infant with a major congenital anomaly. The primary outcome was a CVD composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stroke. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the CVD composite and other cardiovascular outcomes, including unstable angina, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and aortic aneurysm. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses generated hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for maternal demographic, socioeconomic, and chronic health indicators. Median maternal age at baseline was 28.8 years (interquartile range, 25.3-32.5 years). After a median follow-up of 19.5 years (interquartile range, 9.9-27.6 years), 914 women whose infant had a major congenital anomaly experienced a CVD event (1.21 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.13-1.28 per 1000 person-years) vs 7516 women in the comparison group (0.99 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.97-1.01 per 1000 person-years), corresponding to an unadjusted HR of 1.23 (95% CI, 1.15-1.32), and an adjusted HR (aHR) of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.07-1.23). Women who gave birth to an infant with multiorgan anomalies had an even higher aHR (1.37; 95% CI, 1.08-1.72). Mothers of infants with a major anomaly also had an increased aHR of the individual components of the composite outcome and the other cardiovascular outcomes. Women whose child had a major congenital anomaly experienced a 15% to 37% higher risk of premature cardiovascular disease. These women may benefit from targeted interventions aimed at improving their cardiovascular health.

[PMID: 29619932] Ostegenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary disease of the connective tissue caused by mutations to, mainly, the genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of collagen type 1. Patients are grouped according to clinical severity and mode of inheritance according to Sillence's classification (originally 1979, updated 2014). According to our data, the population prevalence of OI in Denmark was 10.3 per 100,000, with 575 patients registered with an OI diagnosis in the National Patient Register and alive at the end of 2012 out of a total population of 5,602,628 persons. Hallmarks of the disease are multiple fractures, blue sclera and varying degrees of bone deformities. Collagen type 1 is the most abundant collagen in the body and is an important part of the structure and function of the heart and lungs, the skeleton and many other organs. We hypothesize that patients with OI will have increased prevalence and risk of fractures throughout life, lower bone mineral density (BMD), impaired bone microstructure and bone geometry and increased risk of cardiovascular diseasesthus increased risk of all cause mortality compared to the general population.  This thesis is a systematic search and narrative review covering the four main areas of interest of the PhD scholarship (risk and causes of death, fracture rates, bone mineral density, -geometry and -microstructure and cardiovascular diseases in OI). In addition to the review the thesis include the following four studies:  1) Study 1 aimed to investigate the main causes of death and the risk of premature death in patients with OI in Denmark. We used a nationwide, registry-based, cohort study design, and included all patients registered in the National Patient Register with an OI diagnosis and a matched reference population randomly selected from the Danish Civil Service Register (matched 5:1, on gender and month and year of birth for each OI patient). We identified 687 patients with OI (25,615 person years at risk) and a reference population of 3,435 (132,131 person years at risk). One hundred and twelve patients with OI and 257 persons in the reference population died during the observation period from 1977 to 2013. The all-cause mortality hazard ratio between the OI cohort and the reference population was 2.90. The median survival time for men with OI was 72.4 years, compared to 81.9 in the reference population. The median survival time for women with OI was 77.4 years, compared to 84.5 years in the reference population. Patients with OI had a higher risk of death from respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases and trauma.  Conclusion: The all-cause hazard ratio for premature death in OI was 2.9 compared to the reference population. There was an increased risk of death due to respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases and death following trauma.  2) Study 2 aimed to compare the fracture rates across the lifespan of patients with OI with that of the general population. Using a nationwide, registry-based, cohort study design, we counted all fractures registered from 1995 in the National Patient Register. The study included the same population as in study 1, but patients who died before 1995 were excluded. We identified 644 patients   (55.6% females) in the OI cohort through the Danish National Patient Register and 3,361 persons (55.2% females), randomly selected from the Civil Registry System. A total of 416 patients with OI experienced a total of 1,566 fractures during the observation period of median 17.9 years (IQ-range: 12.4-18.0), adding up to 10,137 person years. In comparison, 709 persons in the reference population experienced a total of 1,018 fractures during follow-up. Both male and female patients with OI had an increased fracture rate throughout their life. The fracture rate ratio for participants aged 0-19 years was 10.7, for participants aged 20-54 years 17.2, and for participants aged 55 years and over 4.1 when compared to the reference population. The highest fracture rate was seen in males with OI aged 0-19 years (257 fractures per 1,000 person years). The fractures appear to follow the same pattern as in the general population, with a peak during the toddler and adolescent years (IR (incidence rates) 233.9 per 1,000 person years), fewer fractures during adulthood (IR 84.5 per 1000 person years), and increased fracture rate in older women (IR 111.9 per 1,000 person years).  Conclusion: Patients with OI have increased risk of fractures throughout life compared to the general population. The relative risk of fractures generally declines with age, however, increases in older women.  3) Study 3 aimed to evaluate the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone geometry and -microarchitecture in patients with OI type I using a cross-sectional study design and evaluating the participants using HRpQCT. The study included 39 patients with OI type I, and 39 healthy age and gender matched non-OI individuals. The patients were shorter than the reference group (159 ± 10 cm versus 170 ± 9 cm, p < 0.001), but had similar body weight. In patients with OI, areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was 8% lower at the hip (p < 0.05) and 13% lower at the spine (p < 0.001) compared with the reference group. The trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) was 28% lower in radius (p < 0.001) and 38% lower in tibia (p < 0.001) in patients with OI compared with the reference group. At radius, total bone area was 5% lower in OI patients than in controls (p < 0.05). In the tibia, cortical bone area was 18% lower in patients with OI (p < 0.001). In both radius and tibia the number of trabeculae was lower in patients compared to the reference group (35% and 38%, respectively, p < 0.001 at both sites). Furthermore, trabecular spacing was 55% higher in OI patients in both tibia and radius (p < 0.001 at both sites) when compared with reference group.  Conclusion: Patients with type I OI have lower aBMD, vBMD, bone area, and trabecular number when compared with healthy age- and gender-matched individuals.  4) Study 4 aimed to evaluate the risk of valvulopathies, atrial arrhythmias, heart failure and vascular dissections in patients with OI using a nationwide, registry-based, cohort study design. The study included the same population as in study 1. As patients with OI have increased risk of premature death, the risk of cardiovascular diseases is biased by the competing risk of death. We corrected for this increased risk by using a competing risk regression model. We found that the OI population had increased relative risk of mitral valve regurgitation (sub hazard ratio (SHR) 6.3), aortic valve regurgitation (SHR 4.5), atrial fibrillation/flutters (SHR 1.7) and heart failure (SHR 2.3) compared to the reference population. There was no difference in the risk of arterial aneurisms or arterial dissections.  Conclusion: Patients with OI have increased risk of valvulopathies, atrial arrhythmias and heart failure when compared to the reference population, even after adjusting for risk factors for these car-diovascular diseases - indicating that the quantitative or qualitative defects of collagen type 1 synthesis seen in OI influence the risk of these cardiovascular diseases in patients with OI.

[PMID: 27256754] This study sought to examine the association of a borderline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50% to 55% with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a community-based cohort. Guidelines stipulate a LVEF >55% as normal, but the optimal threshold, if any, remains uncertain. The prognosis of a ""borderline"" LVEF, 50% to 55%, is unknown. This study evaluated Framingham Heart Study participants who underwent echocardiography between 1979 and 2008 (n = 10,270 person-observations, mean age 60 years, 57% women). Using pooled data with up to 12 years of follow-up and multivariable Cox regression, we evaluated the associations of borderline LVEF and continuous LVEF with the risk of developing a composite outcome (heart failure [HF] or death; primary outcome) and incident HF (secondary outcome). During follow-up (median 7.9 years), HF developed in 355 participants, and 1,070 died. Among participants with an LVEF of 50% to 55% (prevalence 3.5%), rates of the composite outcome and HF were 0.24 and 0.13 per 10 years of follow-up, respectively, versus 0.16 and 0.05 in participants having a normal LVEF. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, LVEF of 50% to 55% was associated with increased risk of the composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05 to 1.80) and HF (HR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.41 to 3.28). There was a linear inverse relationship of continuous LVEF with the composite outcome (HR per 5 LVEF% decrement: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.16) and HF (HR per 5 LVEF% decrement: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.32). Persons with an LVEF of 50% to 55% in the community have greater risk for morbidity and mortality relative to persons with an LVEF >55%. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the optimal management of these individuals.

[PMID: 25211000] African Americans are at higher risk for preeclampsia compared with Caucasians, but longitudinal changes are unknown. We hypothesized that preeclampsia rates among African Americans would be higher than that of Caucasians and over time would maintain a consistent divergence. We analyzed the annual prevalence rates and calculated prevalence odds ratios (POR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for preeclampsia comparing 4,644 African American (weighted 608,109) with 12,131 Caucasian (weighted 1,844,391) women from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (1979-2006), including all women for whom a delivery was associated with preeclampsia. We estimated the race-specific prevalence of preeclampsia while adjusting for age, geographic region, diabetes, essential hypertension, prior myocardial infarction, heart failure, benign essential hypertension complicating a pregnancy, transient hypertension, and gestational diabetes. There was an increasing trend in preeclampsia rates per year from 1979 to 2006 for African Americans [POR 0.76 (95% CI 0.49, 1.03)] and Caucasians [0.29 (95% CI 0.17, 0.41)]. However, there was an initial decrease in prevalence from 1979-1988 among African-Americans [-0.96 (95% CI -1.78, -0.14)] that was not seen in Caucasians [0.12 (95% CI -0.33, 0.57)]. Across all study years, preeclampsia rates remained higher for African Americans compared to Caucasians, from a POR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96, 1.0) to POR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.73, 1.78). There was an increase in the prevalence of preeclampsia in African Americans compared to Caucasians in the most recent decade under study. This may be explained by healthcare system changes and disparities in obesity. Action is needed to reduce the trajectory of future cardiovascular disease caused by preeclampsia.

[PMID: 23810869] This study sought to evaluate the risk of cancer in patients with heart failure (HF) compared with community controls and to determine the impact of cancer post-HF on outcomes. HF is associated with excess morbidity and mortality. Noncardiac causes of adverse outcomes in HF are increasingly recognized, but not fully characterized. In a case-control study, we compared the history of cancer among community subjects newly diagnosed with HF from 1979 to 2002 to age-, sex-, and date-matched community controls without HF (961 pairs). Individuals without cancer at the index date (596 pairs) were followed for cancer in a cohort design, and the survival of HF patients who developed cancer was assessed. Before the index date, 22% of HF cases and 23% of controls had a history of cancer (odds ratio [OR]: 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75 to 1.17). During 9,203 person-years of follow-up (7.7 ± 6.4 years), 244 new cancer cases were identified; HF patients had a 68% higher risk of developing cancer (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.50) adjusted for body mass index, smoking, and comorbidities. The HRs were similar for men and women, with a trend toward a stronger association among subjects ≤75 years of age (p = 0.22) and during the most recent time period (p = 0.075). Among HF cases, incident cancer increased the risk of death (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.99) adjusted for age, sex, index year, and comorbidities. HF patients are at increased risk of cancer, which appears to have increased over time. Cancer increases mortality in HF, underscoring the importance of noncardiac morbidity and of cancer surveillance in the management of HF patients.

[PMID: 22039095] Evaluation of the carcinogenicity of lead for humans has been based primarily on the results of studies on occupationally exposed men, although gender differences in lead metabolism have been reported. In addition, most of the previous studies have been limited by a failure to identify and control for co-exposures to other known occupational carcinogens. The present study follows an industrial cohort of workers, mostly women, with moderate lead exposure and no confounding by other occupational exposures. Workers, employed at least 2 years between 1950 and 1978 in manual and mechanical (linotype) typesetting and type foundries in 27 printing plants in Moscow, were included in the cohort, which comprised 1423 men and 3102 women. The cohort was followed up during 1979-2003 and contributed 93,682 person-years of observation. Follow-up was 97.7% complete. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% CIs, based on mortality rates of the Moscow general population and adjusted for gender, age and calendar time, were calculated for the total cohort as well as subcohorts stratified by various exposure parameters. Among women, mortality from all causes, circulatory diseases and all cancers combined was lower than that in the Moscow general population and was similar across work groups. Among men, there was excess overall mortality, mainly due to increased mortality from ischaemic heart disease. For both sexes, no significant excess risk for any cancer site was observed, although some dose-response patterns were found. In the overall cohort, mortality from cancers of the kidney and pancreas increased up to twofold in the highest tertile of cumulative lead exposure based on duration and a relative ranking of the three subcohorts (9 deaths; SMR=2.12, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.07) and (18 deaths; SMR=2.32, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.68), respectively. Similar mortality trends for these two cancers were found in analyses by gender. Consistencies by sex and exposure level make a strong case for a link between exposure to inorganic lead and cancers of the kidney and pancreas.

[PMID: 20193835] We reported earlier that there was no decline of acute myocardial infarction hospitalization from 1988 to 1997. We now extend these observations to document trends in acute myocardial infarction hospitalization rates and in-hospital case-fatality rates for 27 years from 1979 to 2005. We determined hospitalization rates for acute myocardial infarction by age and gender using data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey and US civilian population from 1979 to 2005, aggregated by 3-year groupings. We also assessed comorbid, complications, cardiac procedure use, and in-hospital case-fatality rates. Age-adjusted hospitalization rate for acute myocardial infarction identified by primary International Classification of Diseases code was 215 per 100,000 people in 1979-1981 and increased to 342 in 1985-1987. Thereafter, the rate stabilized for the next decade and then declined slowly after 1996 to 242 in 2003-2005. Trends were similar for men and women, although rates for men were almost twice that of women. Hospitalization rates increased substantially with age and were the highest among those aged 85 years or more. Although median hospital stay decreased from 12 to 4 days, intensity of hospital care increased, including use of coronary angioplasty, coronary bypass, and thrombolytics therapy. During the period, reported comorbidity from diabetes and hypertension increased. Acute myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure increased, and cardiogenic shock decreased. Altogether, the in-hospital case-fatality rate declined. During the past quarter century, hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction increased until the mid-1990s, but has declined since then. At the same time, in-hospital case-fatality rates declined steadily. This decline has been associated with more aggressive therapeutic intervention.

[PMID: 20031905] The relationship between neutrophils and outcomes post-myocardial infarction (MI) is not completely characterized. We examined the associations of neutrophil count with mortality and post-MI heart failure (HF) and their incremental value for risk discrimination in the community. MI was diagnosed with cardiac pain, biomarkers, and Minnesota coding of the ECG. Neutrophil count at presentation, reported as counts x10(9)/L, was categorized by tertiles (lower tertile, <5.7; middle tertile, 5.7 to 8.5; upper tertile, >8.5). From 1979 to 2002, 2047 incident MIs occurred in Olmsted County, Minn (mean age, 68+/-14 years; 44% women). Median (25th to 75th percentile) neutrophil count was 7.0 (5.1 to 9.5). Within 3 years post-MI, 577 patients died, and 770 developed HF. Overall survival and survival free of HF decreased with increased neutrophil tertile (P<0.001). Compared with the lower tertile, the age and sex adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.81) for the middle tertile and 2.60 (95% CI, 2.10 to 3.22) for the upper tertile (P<0.001). Similarly, for HF, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.59) for the middle and 2.12 (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.53) for the upper tertile (P<0.001). These associations persisted after adjustment for risk factors, comorbidities, Killip class, revascularization, and ejection fraction. Neutrophil count improved risk discrimination as indicated by increases in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (all P<0.05) and by the integrated discrimination improvement analysis (all P<0.001). In the community, the neutrophil count was strongly and independently associated with death and HF post-MI and improved risk discrimination over traditional predictors.

[PMID: 19854330] The relative contribution of risk factors to the development of heart failure remains controversial. Further, whether these contributions have changed over time or differ by sex is unclear. Few population-based studies have been performed. We aimed to estimate the population attributable risk (PAR) associated with key risk factors for heart failure in the community. Between 1979 and 2002, 962 incident heart failure cases in Olmsted County were age and sex-matched to population-based controls using Rochester Epidemiology Project resources. We determined the frequency of risk factors (coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and smoking), odds ratios, and PAR of each risk factor for heart failure. The mean number of risk factors for heart failure per case was 1.9 + or - 1.1 and increased over time (P<.001). Hypertension was the most common (66%), followed by smoking (51%). The prevalence of hypertension, obesity, and smoking increased over time. The risk of heart failure was particularly high for coronary disease and diabetes with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 3.05 (2.36-3.95) and 2.65 (1.98-3.54), respectively. However, the PAR was highest for coronary disease and hypertension; each accounted for 20% of heart failure cases in the population, although coronary disease accounted for the greatest proportion of cases in men (PAR 23%) and hypertension was of greatest importance in women (PAR 28%). Preventing coronary disease and hypertension will have the greatest population impact in preventing heart failure. Sex-targeted prevention strategies might confer additional benefit. However, these relationships can change, underscoring the importance of continued surveillance of heart failure.",10

This study investigated the farm-level prevalence of IBV and evaluated associated risk factors in northern Vietnam by a cross-sectional study from June 2022 to June 2024. A total of 69 poultry farms were randomly selected across nine provinces, and pooled tracheal swab samples were purposively collected for IBV detection using RT-qPCR. The overall IBV farm-level prevalence was 34.78 % (95 % CI:23.71-47.21 %). Although no statistically significant differences were found across provinces, production types, age groups, or flock sizes, IBV was detected in all subgroups, indicating widespread circulation of the virus. A total of 22 potential risk factors were initially assessed using univariate logistic regression. Of these, six variables with P < 0.1, including farm size, number of poultry houses, presence of multiple age groups, vaccination at day-old, frequency of disinfection before chick placement, and proximity to live bird markets and residential areas, were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model retained two independent predictors: performing more than one disinfection before chick placement (P = 0.035), and administration of a live IB vaccine at one day of age (P = 0.006), both of which were significantly associated with reduced the odds of IBV infection at the farm level. These findings suggest that strategic vaccination and careful calibration of disinfection protocols are critical to minimizing IBV transmission at the farm level.

[PMID: 41187351] Epidemiological studies of large groups of nuclear industry workers offer a significant opportunity to increase our understanding of the long-term effects on health of the protracted accumulation of dose received at a low dose rate from many discrete exposures to ionising radiation. The effects of such extended aggregation of doses form an important part of the everyday concerns of radiological protection against low-level exposures. For more than half a century, databases of nuclear workers have been assembled, and the numbers of workers currently included in studies, together with the numbers of deaths among them that have now occurred, are capable of generating reasonably precise risk estimates that should provide meaningful comparisons with those obtained from other studies, such as of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, constructing, updating and maintaining these large databases, linking workers to occupational dose databases and to registers of deaths (and other outcomes, such as incident cancers) and their causes, and analyses of these data that endeavour to take account of other influential factors (such as smoking) are far from straightforward. A critical review of recent nuclear worker studies illustrates the difficulties in reliably interpreting reported statistical associations between rates of cancer and cumulative occupational doses because of the real possibility of distortions produced by biases, confounding and/or the interplay of radiation with other risk factors. This doesn't mean that studies of nuclear workers should be abandoned, far from it, but it does mean that appropriate effort needs to be expended on these studies before confident conclusions about the levels of risks from radiation exposure can be drawn from them. Unexpected findings should be examined in depth to gain a proper understanding of their origin, including the impact of doses from intakes of radionuclides upon dose-responses derived using doses from external sources of radiation.

[PMID: 41187344] The efficacy, best dosage, and safety of liposomal amphotericin B (LAB) in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania braziliensis in elderly patients was determined by a randomized, controlled trial. We selected 28 patients of both sexes age 60 years old or older with CL diagnosis confirmed by detection of L. braziliensis DNA. The groups were treated with different total doses of LAB (group 1: 12 mg/kg; group 2: 18 mg/kg; and group 3: 24 mg/kg). Clinical and laboratory evaluations were carried out during a period of 180 days (day 0, day 15, day 30, day 60, day 90, and day 180). The highest cure rate (89%) was in group 3 (differences were not statistically significant) along with the lowest incidence of side effects (11%), suggesting that 24 mg/kg is the best dose of LAB to treat CL in elderly patients.

[PMID: 41187341] Although acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a preventable condition, it continues to be diagnosed in Far North Queensland, Australia. Enhanced primary prevention is necessary to reduce the local burden of ARF and rheumatic heart disease. In this retrospective clinical audit, all cases of definite ARF in the remote Torres Strait and Cape York region of Far North Queensland between January 2020 and December 2024 were examined. Clinical records were reviewed to identify and characterize any healthcare presentations of individuals during the 6 weeks preceding their ARF diagnosis. Of 67 individuals with definite ARF 65 (97%) identified as First Nations Australians; 43/67 (64%) did not present for any healthcare in the 6 weeks preceding their diagnosis; and a further 10/67 (15%) presented for healthcare that was unrelated to group A Streptococcus (Strep A) infection. Overall, a possible Strep A infection (skin infection or sore throat) was identified in 14/67 (21%) patients; 9/67 (13%) patients presented with skin infections, and 5/67 (7%) presented with sore throats. Of these, 5/14 (36%) received appropriate antibiotic treatment. Most individuals with definite ARF in this remote region of Australia do not present for healthcare before their diagnosis; however, there remain opportunities for the primary prevention of ARF among those who do. Culturally considered health promotion, opportunistic screening, and improved recognition and treatment of Strep A infection are critical for reducing ARF incidence in this region of Australia. It is also important to define the contribution of asymptomatic Strep A infections to the pathogenesis of ARF.

[PMID: 41187337] The objective of this study was to compare coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza among US active-component service members (ACSMs) stationed at military installations near the US-Mexico border (Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas). A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess diagnoses of influenza (2020-2024) and COVID-19 (2020-2023). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing influenza and COVID-19 at border and non-border locations were calculated for laboratory-confirmed and/or symptom-based encounter diagnoses. Forty-five percent of ACSMs included in the influenza (N = 650,505) and COVID-19 (N = 660,333) analyses were near the border. There was no statistically significant increase of either COVID-19 or influenza incidence among ACSMs stationed near the border compared with those located elsewhere in the same states. A statistically significantly reduced adjusted IRR (aIRR) of laboratory-confirmed influenza (aIRR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.98) and COVID-19 (aIRR: 0.97; 95%: CI: 0.96, 0.99) was observed among ACSMs stationed near the border compared with those located elsewhere in the same states for all states combined for the entire study period. Similarly, significantly lower aIRRs were observed for all diagnoses (laboratory-confirmed or symptoms-based encounter) of influenza (aIRR: 0.81; 95% CI:0.80, 0.82) among ACSMs near the border compared with ACSMs not near the border for all states combined for the entire duration of the study. However, incidence rates of COVID-19 and influenza varied across some specific states and time periods. By assessing the potential health threats of cross-border transmission, public health officials can more effectively deploy preventive and response measures among ACSMs living and working near the US-Mexico border.

[PMID: 41187332] The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) compared with anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and its impact on the primary prevention of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Patients with non-valvular AF and high thromboembolic risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc > 2 points) were included. LAAO was compared against the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 11, 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-E, while statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.4.1. A total of 10 studies with 5,779 patients were analyzed (2,916 with LAAO and 2,863 with anticoagulation). LAAO reduced, though without statistical significance, the incidence of ischemic stroke (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09). However, it showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the overall anticoagulant group (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.80; p = 0.0004). LAAO emerges as a viable strategy to reduce mortality in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, particularly when long-term anticoagulation is not feasible. Its superiority over DOACs and comparable profile to VKAs, along with the absence of periodic INR monitoring and relevant drug interactions, make it an option that may optimize adherence and quality of life.

[PMID: 41187329] The prevalence and incidence of dementia are higher in migrants and those with low socioeconomic status (SES). Mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer a potentially scalable way to reduce dementia risk via risk factor modification. We co-designed the MIND-PRO app-an mHealth intervention targeting dementia risk factors through self-managed lifestyle changes and remote coaching-specifically designed for Dutch individuals with low SES and those with Turkish or South Asian Surinamese migration backgrounds. We focused on these migrant populations as they are the largest in the Netherlands and have the highest risk of developing dementia. In this qualitative study, we explored the needs and preferences of our target populations aged 50-75 years old at increased dementia risk by conducting semistructured interviews and focus groups. Participant feedback was used to iteratively refine and adapt a prototype intervention based on insights from prior mHealth trials. We interviewed 23 participants (median age 59, IQR 55-63 y; n=15, 65% female) and conducted two focus groups with 7 Turkish women and 13 Dutch participants with low SES. The target populations emphasized personalization features such as goal setting, self-tracking, educational material, and remote coaching. Participants highlighted the importance of social interaction and autonomy in achieving sustainable lifestyle changes. Tailoring coaching and lifestyle advice to cultural practices was deemed beneficial. Optimal mHealth interventions targeting dementia risk factors in migrants and individuals with low SES should be personalized and interactive, respect autonomy, and integrate cultural needs and preferences.

[PMID: 41187316] Accurate preoperative planning is essential for the treatment of complex fractures, but the proportion of patients who have access to this service remains low. Therefore, the purpose was to evaluate the association of computer-assisted preoperative planning via digital telemedicine with the risk of postoperative in-hospital complications for periarticular fractures of the extremities. A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed from January 2010 to December 2019. A total of 11 192 patients (≥18 years) with periarticular fractures of the extremities (proximal humerus, distal humerus, distal radius, intertrochanteric, distal femur, tibial plateau, distal tibia, and trimalleolar) were identified and divided into 2 cohorts: 7130 (63.7%) patients received conventional preoperative planning and 4062 (36.3%) patients received computer-assisted preoperative planning via telemedicine. Propensity score matching for 23 baseline characteristics yielded 4050 patient pairs. Primary outcome was in-hospital complications (surgical site infection, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, sepsis, thromboembolic event, stroke, and myocardial infarction). Among 11 192 unadjusted patients, the mean (SD) age was 60.2 (12.3) years, and 7052 (63.0%) were female. After propensity score matching (total 8100 patients, 4050 patients in each group), patients with computer-assisted preoperative planning via telemedicine had the lower in-hospital complications (7.9% [318/4050 patients] vs.10.9% [442/4050 patients]; hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.89]; P = 0.002) compared with those with conventional method. For patients undergoing complex periarticular fractures of the extremities, the use of computer-assisted preoperative planning via digital telemedicine was associated with lower incidence of in-hospital complications compared with the use of conventional method.

[PMID: 41187312] Asbestosis among adolescents and young adults is a growing concern. However, a systematic assessment of its global burden in this age group is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the global, regional, and national burden of asbestosis among adolescents and young adults from 1990 to 2021. Data on prevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were sourced from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021. The Joinpoint regression was applied to calculate the average annual percentage change of age-standardised rate. In 2021, there were 6275.95 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 4215.90-8945.83) prevalent and 833.77 (95% UI: 575.08-1151.14) incident cases of asbestosis among adolescents and young adults, accounting for 3113.03 (95% UI: 2090.19-4071.12) DALYs. The age-standardised prevalence, incidence, and DALYs rate per 100 000 population was 0.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.31), 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01-0.05), and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.07-0.14), respectively. The global age-standardised prevalence and incidence of asbestosis in adolescents and young adults had an upward trend, while the global age-standardised DALYs rate declined from 1990 to 2021. The burden of asbestosis among adolescents and young adults demonstrated heterogeneity among countries of different sociodemographic index (SDI) levels, with the most pronounced increase observed in high SDI countries. Regionally, Western Europe, Australasia, and High-income North America exhibited the most rapid escalation in asbestosis burden, whereas Eastern Europe experienced the greatest decline. Additionally, the global burden of asbestosis increased with age, peaking at 35-39 years. Males were more susceptible to early-onset asbestosis than females within the same age group. Asbestosis remains a public health challenge among adolescents and young adults, with the age-standardised incidence increasing from 1990 to 2021, patricianly in high SDI countries. Our findings emphasise the urgent need for the implementation of asbestos ban worldwide.

[PMID: 41187295] Unfortunately, some lumbar fusion patients will experience psychological distress and a deterioration of mental health postoperatively. At the extreme, these changes can lead to self-harm and suicide. This study evaluated the incidence of self-harm within 1 year of elective lumbar fusion procedures to identify risk factors for self-harm events. The PearlDiver Mariner 170 data set from 2010 to 2023 was retrospectively analyzed. Patients undergoing 1-level to 3-level posterior lumbar fusion with minimum 1-year follow-up were included. Patients with a history of self-harm before surgery were excluded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to assess risk factors for self-harm. Statistical significance was assessed at P < 0.05. In total, 138,223 patients were included. The incidence of self-harm within 1 year was 0.40% (549 patients). In the multivariable model, younger age, male sex, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores were risk factors for self-harm. Specific comorbidities associated with increased risk for self-harm included alcohol use disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, tobacco use, and preoperative opioid use (all P < 0.001). The strongest associations between comorbidity and self-harm were seen for depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.68), anxiety (OR = 2.03), and alcohol use disorder (OR = 1.89). Self-harm is a rare, yet understudied potential complication of lumbar fusion procedures. In this national database study, the incidence of self-harm was 0.4% in the year after elective lumbar fusion. Although some risk factors for self-harm are nonmodifiable, other behavioral and mental health comorbidities may serve to flag patients as targets for early preventive intervention.",10
Increased microtubule acetylation exacerbates LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutation induced locomotor deficits.,microtubule acetylation AND LRRK2 mutation AND Roc-COR domain AND locomotor deficits,"25316291,41178388,41174898,41171629,41169272,41164908,41164759,41164274,41154800,41154588","[PMID: 25316291] Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 is a multifunctional protein affecting many cellular processes and has been described to bind microtubules. Defective microtubule-based axonal transport is hypothesized to contribute to Parkinson's disease, but whether LRRK2 mutations affect this process to mediate pathogenesis is not known. Here we find that LRRK2 containing pathogenic Roc-COR domain mutations (R1441C, Y1699C) preferentially associates with deacetylated microtubules, and inhibits axonal transport in primary neurons and in Drosophila, causing locomotor deficits in vivo. In vitro, increasing microtubule acetylation using deacetylase inhibitors or the tubulin acetylase αTAT1 prevents association of mutant LRRK2 with microtubules, and the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) restores axonal transport. In vivo knockdown of the deacetylases HDAC6 and Sirt2, or administration of TSA rescues both axonal transport and locomotor behavior. Thus, this study reveals a pathogenic mechanism and a potential intervention for Parkinson's disease.

[PMID: 41178388] Spinal cord injuries (SCI) can occur from either traumatic or non-traumatic causes. While traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), caused by acute external forces, is well-researched, non-traumatic spinal cord injury (NTSCI), arising from chronic conditions like tumors and infections, is often underreported and misclassified. NTSCI is increasingly recognized as a major cause of SCI globally, particularly affecting the elderly and infants. Despite its prevalence, research on NTSCI remains limited, necessitating new models to understand its pathophysiology. This study introduces a novel, repeatable model for NTSCI in both neonatal (9 days post-partum) and adult rats (9 weeks post-partum), simulating chronic compression injuries. The model uses 3D-printed (PLA) spacers to induce mild-moderate compression in the lower thoracic vertebrae. Six weeks of spinal cord compression resulted in locomotor deficits and cellular changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic injury due to disrupted blood flow, without significant long-term inflammation or astrogliosis. This versatile model can be easily adapted for different age groups, for graded injury severities, and for different injury durations. It offers a promising avenue for understanding and treating chronic compression NTSCI, addressing a critical gap in current research. This model can be used in future research to test and understand the effectiveness and pathophysiology of decompression and cellular interventions in response to chronic compression NTSCI.

[PMID: 41174898] Microtubules are critical components of the cytoskeleton that are extensively involved in various cellular and biological processes. The execution of these functions is intricately linked to post-translational modifications of tubulin. Post-translational modifications of tubulin include acetylation, tyrosination, de-tyrosination, glutamylation, SUMOylation, and so on. These modifications are closely associated with a wide range of biological processes. Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant microtubule modifications are implicated in various diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, cardiac atrial hypertrophy, and even infertility. Aneuploid oocytes are a common cause of infertility, spontaneous abortion, trisomy syndrome, and other congenital abnormalities. The occurrence of aneuploidy is often closely associated with defects in spindle assembly, which are influenced by a series of tubulin modifications. In this review, we aimed to summarize the factors that affect tubulin modification and explore the key mechanisms underlying aneuploidy in human oocytes, thereby providing new insights and strategies for the treatment of infertility and prevention of congenital defects in newborns.

[PMID: 41171629] Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Mutations in human leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein containing both a kinase and a GTPase, are a leading cause of the familial form of PD. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity. While the bulk of LRRK2 is found in the cytosol, the protein associates with membranes where its Rab GTPase substrates are found, and under certain conditions, with microtubules. Integrative structural studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revealed the architecture of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments, and that formation of these filaments requires LRRK2's kinase to be in the active-like conformation. However, whether LRRK2 can interact with and form filaments on microtubules in its autoinhibited state, where the kinase domain is in the inactive conformation and the N-terminal LRR domain covers the kinase active site, was not known. Using cryo-ET, we show that full-length human LRRK2 can oligomerize on microtubules in its autoinhibited state. Both WT-LRRK2 and PD-linked LRRK2 mutants formed filaments on microtubules. While these filaments are stabilized by the same interfaces seen in the active-LRRK2 filaments, we observed a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats that were disordered in the active-LRRK2 filaments. The helical parameters of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are different from those reported for the active-LRRK2 filaments. Finally, the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are shorter and less regular, suggesting they are less stable.

[PMID: 41169272] Freezing of gait is a debilitating motor symptom in Parkinson's disease that significantly increases fall risk and impairs quality of life. The poorly understood pathophysiology of freezing of gait presents challenges for early prediction and therapeutic intervention. This prospective study investigated whether eye movement abnormalities, specifically in the anti-saccade paradigm, could predict freezing of gait onset in Parkinson's disease patients over a two-year follow-up period. We analysed longitudinal data from the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative, focusing on Parkinson's disease patients without freezing of gait at baseline who underwent comprehensive clinical evaluations and eye movement recordings. Anti-saccade reaction time and error ratio, combined with clinical measures including right upper extremity rigidity, demonstrated significant predictive value for freezing of gait development within two years. These findings suggest that eye movement deficits and upper limb rigidity emerge years before freezing of gait onset, indicating a prodromal phase in freezing of gait pathogenesis. The predictive relationship between these measures supports the hypothesis of shared neural substrates, potentially involving the mesencephalic locomotor region, in the development of both oculomotor dysfunction and gait freezing episodes.

[PMID: 41164908] The p.D620N mutation in VPS35 causes an autosomal dominant form of Parkinson's disease via mechanisms that are poorly understood. PINK1 and parkin, two proteins whose loss of function underlies autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, cooperate to mediate mitophagy, a quality control pathway for selective elimination of damaged mitochondria. PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy is disrupted by LRRK2 mutations, which are the most prevalent cause of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. Here, we investigated whether the p.D620N VPS35 mutation has an effect on PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy. We identified a novel family with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease caused by a p.D620N VPS35 mutation. We cultured skin fibroblasts and iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from the proband and from a second, unrelated Parkinson's disease patient with the p.D620N VPS35 mutation, and compared them with isogenic and non-isogenic control cells. PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy was severely impaired in VPS35 mutant fibroblasts and neurons, while non-selective, starvation-induced autophagy and lysosomal degradative capacity were preserved. siRNA-mediated VPS35 knockdown rescued the mitophagy defect in VPS35 mutant cells, whereas overexpression of wild-type VPS35 did not, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism of the mutation. The VPS35 mutation did not interfere with activation of PINK1 or parkin after mitochondrial depolarization, but impaired mitochondrial recruitment of the autophagy receptor optineurin. LRRK2 kinase activity was increased in the VPS35 mutant cells, as shown by enhanced levels of the T73-phosphorylated form of the LRRK2 substrate RAB10. The enhanced level of phosphorylated RAB10 in VPS35 mutant cells was decreased by treatment with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors and by VPS35 knockdown. Importantly, the mitophagy defect of VPS35 mutant fibroblasts and neurons was fully rescued by LRRK2 kinase inhibitors as well as by overexpression of PPM1H, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates multiple RAB substrates of LRRK2. Finally, in situ proximity ligation experiments revealed that endogenous VPS35 and LRRK2 are proximity partners in human dopaminergic neurons and that this proximity relationship is enhanced by the VPS35 mutation. In conclusion, the VPS35 mutation impairs PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy via a gain-of-function mechanism that involves stimulation of LRRK2 kinase activity. Thus, a VPS35/LRRK2 axis linked to dominant Parkinson's disease intersects with a pathway mediated by proteins encoded by the recessive Parkinson's disease genes.

[PMID: 41164759] Aging is a progressive and irreversible process linked to a variety of diseases. Examination of the processes targeted by pharmacological treatments could potentially both extend lifespan and alleviate age-associated diseases. 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (20(S)-PPD), a primary ginsenoside metabolite, has many beneficial properties, although it`s anti-aging effects are unknown. Lifespan and behavioral assays were used to determine the effects of 20(S)-PPD on life span and healthy lifespan. Stress resistance was systematically determined under heat, oxidative, and chemical stress conditions. The target of 20(S)-PPD was identified by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance. Investigation in mutant worms identified the signaling pathway and transcription factor mediating 20(S)-PPD-induced longevity. 20(S)-PPD could significantly extend <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) lifespan without affecting food intake and reproductive output. It also improved healthspan in aging worms by ameliorating locomotor deficits and suppressing lipofuscin accumulation. Furthermore, 20(S)-PPD enhanced stress resistance and reduced age-associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Mechanistically, 20(S)-PPD bound dose-dependently to the insulin receptor (IR) with a KD value of 8.59 μM. The life-extending effects of 20(S)-PPD involved the DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, rather than other conserved pathways. Treatment with 20(S)-PPD promoted DAF-16/FOXO activation and nuclear translocation, leading to upregulated transcription of several antioxidant and detoxification-related genes, including <i>lys-7</i>, <i>mtl-1</i>, <i>hsp-12.6</i>, <i>dod-3</i>, <i>sod-3</i>, <i>hsp-16.2</i>, <i>gst-4</i> and <i>sms-1</i>. 20(S)-PPD also upregulated the protein levels of SOD-3 and GST-4, known promoters of longevity in <i>C. elegans</i>. These findings demonstrate that IR is a molecular target of 20(S)-PPD and reveal a mechanism by which 20(S)-PPD promotes longevity and stress resistance, suggesting the potential of 20(S)-PPD in slowing aging and the development of age-associated disorders.

[PMID: 41164274] Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a link between the RAB29 gene and Parkinson's disease (PD). The Rab29 protein encoded by RAB29 regulates leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Mutations in the LRRK2 gene increase its kinase activity and contribute to autosomal dominant forms of PD. Previous research has shown that altered LRRK2 kinase activity may correlate with the activity of lysosomal hydrolases and the concentration of sphingolipids. This study aimed to assess the association of the rs823144 variant in the promoter region of the RAB29 gene with PD risk, and to evaluate RAB29 expression, lysosomal hydrolase activity, and sphingolipid concentrations in the blood of PD patients. We screened the rs823144 variant of the RAB29 gene in a cohort of PD patients (N = 903) and controls (N = 618) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The expression of the RAB29 gene was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using qPCR. We assessed the activities of lysosomal hydrolases (glucocerebrosidase (GCase), alpha-galactosidase (GLA), acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), and galactosylcerebrosidase (GALC)) and the concentrations of sphingolipids (globotriaosylsphingosine (LysoGb3), sphingomyelin (LysoSM), and hexosylsphingosine (HexSph)) in blood using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The RAB29 rs823144 C allele was associated with a reduced risk of PD in the Northwestern Russian population (OR = 0.7806, 95 % CI: 0.6578-0.9263, p = 0.0046), which is consistent with global data. However, no significant association was observed between the rs823144 C allele and RAB29 mRNA expression in PBMCs. Notably, the C allele was associated with increased GLA activity and decreased concentrations of LysoGb3 and LysoSM in the blood of PD patients. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time an association between the RAB29 rs823144 C allele and a reduced risk of PD in the Northwestern Russian population. Moreover, the RAB29 rs823144 C allele is associated with altered lysosomal enzyme activity and sphingolipid profiles, suggesting a potential role of RAB29 in sphingolipid metabolism relevant to PD pathogenesis.

[PMID: 41154800] Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder marked by the gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. This neuronal degradation causes motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. Despite decades of research, current treatments remain limited to symptom management, highlighting the urgent need for deeper insights into PD mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches. Among model organisms, zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) have emerged as a valuable tool for PD research due to the possibility of genetic manipulation. Zebrafish can be engineered to carry human PD-associated mutations, such as those in α-synuclein, LRRK2, and Parkin, enabling researchers to study the molecular and cellular basis of the disease. Additionally, exposure to neurotoxins like MPTP and paraquat allows scientists to replicate PD-like symptoms in zebrafish, supporting drug screening and behavioural analysis. This review summarises the key advantages and limitations of zebrafish as a model for PD, compares it with rodent models, and discusses recent advances and future directions that may improve translational outcomes in PD therapy and personalised medicine.

[PMID: 41154588] Given the central role of neurogenesis in building a functional nervous system, we recently developed a zebrafish-based drug-screening protocol to uncover molecules and signalling pathways regulating spinal cord neurogenesis. In this study, we have expanded this drug screen and discovered a previously unknown role of deacetylase sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) in promoting the generation of serotonergic interneurons in the spinal cord. Treatments with specific SIRT2 inhibitors reduced the generation of serotonergic neurons in the spinal cord, which led to locomotor deficits. Our data suggest that SIRT2 regulates mitotic activity in progenitor cells to promote the generation of serotonergic neurons in developing animals. Together, our results uncover SIRT2 as a key regulator of spinal cord neurogenesis and position it as a promising target for strategies aimed at neural repair in spinal cord disorders.",10

An adjunctive intervention could entail reframing bradykinesia to foster a more positive orientation toward this symptom. This paper aims to conceptualize the context-dependent benefits of this intervention. This Perspective draws on analytical thinking and synthesis of ideas from literature across medicine, psychology, and philosophy. It discusses the theoretical basis and evidence for developing a positive reframing of bradykinesia, based on potential adaptive benefits. While bradykinesia poses undeniable challenges, it may foster greater attention and adaptability by encouraging individuals to engage with its slower and variable pace. Such reframing may support safer, more intentional task execution and promote improved communication, alternative approaches to exercise, and creative problem-solving. Reframing slower movement and related movement patterns as potential resources in certain contexts could complement conventional treatments by adapting environments and daily tasks. Various social conditions support this perspective amid valid counterarguments.

[PMID: 41187107] Emerging clinical evidence suggests a link between environmental noise and the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNcDA neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNcDA neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.

[PMID: 41186960] While olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson disease (PD), its neural basis and clinical implications remain to be clarified. We investigated the neural substrates and clinical profiles, particularly non-motor symptoms (NMSs), associated with olfactory function. This retrospective study included 259 drug-naïve patients with PD who underwent the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT), comprehensive autonomic function test, neuropsychological assessments, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) at diagnosis. NMS profiles were compared across olfactory groups defined by CC-SIT scores (normosmia [n = 45], hyposmia [n = 143], anosmia [n = 74]). Associations between olfaction and clinical/imaging variables were assessed using correlation and path analyses. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the risk of developing motor complications or PD dementia according to olfactory status. CC-SIT scores correlated with Composite Autonomic Severity Scale scores (rho = -0.219, p = 0.001), NPI-Q scores (rho = -0.269, p < 0.001), and cognitive performance in memory (rho = 0.288, p < 0.001) and frontal/executive domains (rho = 0.205, p = 0.001). Dopaminergic depletion in the caudate nucleus and limbic atrophy emerged as neural substrates underlying olfactory dysfunction, mediating the association between olfaction and cognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms. Anosmia was associated with increased risk of developing PD dementia compared to normosmia (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.579; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.137-5.851) and hyposmia (HR: 2.783; 95% CI: 1.437-5.390). Anosmia was associated with higher risk of developing freezing of gait (HR: 2.571; 95% CI: 1.077-6.134) compared to normosmia. Olfactory dysfunction serves as a multifaceted clinical marker associated with convergent degeneration of nigrostriatal and limbic pathways, offering insights into PD phenotypic variance and its prognostic implications.

[PMID: 41186756] Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical features, making differential diagnosis challenging. The AQEE and GGEE peptides, derived from the proVGF neuroprotein, have emerged as potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for dementia. Indeed, we previously observed a reduction in AQEE-10 levels using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and GGEE levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a cohort of DLB patients compared to both controls and AD patients. To better investigate the diagnostic utility of these peptides, we analyzed CSF samples from both the original cohort and a newly recruited cohort. The new cohort (cohort 1) included patients, from Ulm University Hospital, with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and DLB (combined as PDD/DLB; n = 18), and AD (n = 19). The previously analyzed cohort (cohort 2), from the Amsterdam University Medical Center, included DLB (n = 44), AD (n = 20), and cognitively healthy controls (n = 22). AQEE-10 levels were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in cohort 1 and by ELISA in both cohorts. GGEE levels were measured by ELISA in cohort 1 to corroborate and extend previous findings. MRM-based analysis revealed a significant reduction of AQEE-10 levels in DLB compared to both controls and AD (p < 0.05; ROC-AUC: 78% and 82%, respectively). This finding was confirmed by ELISA, for both AQEE-10 and GGEE peptide levels, along with a positive correlation between their concentrations. These results support AQEE-10 and GGEE as promising peptide biomarkers for distinguishing DLB from other dementia.

[PMID: 41186735] Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremors, and muscle rigidity. Although several disease-causing genes of juvenile Parkinson's disease have been reported, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we identified SCAMP5 as a novel disease-causing gene of Parkinson's disease in a consanguineous family with juvenile Parkinson's disease. Functional studies in PC12 cell lines revealed that SCAMP5 deficiency increased the level of α-synuclein protein and α-synuclein oligomers, leading to increased cell apoptosis and decreased dopamine secretion. SCAMP5 knockdown in SH-SY5Y cells reduces α-synuclein secretion via exosome. Expression of human wild-type SCAMP5 rescued these effects, whereas the R91W mutant SCAMP5 did not. Scamp5a knockout zebrafish showed Parkinson's disease-like phenotypes, including bradykinesia, loss of dopamine neurons and decreased dopamine content in the brain. Transcriptome analysis unveiled upregulated JNK signaling in scamp5a knockout zebrafish, contributing to neuronal apoptosis. Importantly, human SCAMP5 prevented both dopamine neuron loss and bradykinesia in scamp5a knockout zebrafish, suggesting its therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease. Overall, our findings identify SCAMP5 as a novel disease-causing gene of Parkinson's disease and highlight its neuroprotective role, opening new avenues for Parkinson's disease treatment.

[PMID: 41186720] The gut-brain axis is a highly complex, bidirectional communication link between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS), mainly through neural, endocrine, immunological, and metabolic pathways. This review outlines the growing contribution of gut microbiota in the remediation of neurological health and also emphasizes the controlling role of gut microbiota on the synthesis of neurotransmitters. Emerging evidence indicates that dysbiosis of the gut is related to a variety of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), depression, and glioblastoma. Mechanistic understandings show that gut microbes critically contribute to neuroimmune and blood-brain barrier (BBB) signaling. The peripheral association of gut microflora, networked with inflammasome activation, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and type-I IFN pathways highlights their role in CNS inflammation. Microbiota-targeted interventions with probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, dietary modifications, and fecal microbiota transplantation are examined for their therapeutic potential. These strategies appear to be promising to reinstate microbial balance, enhance neuroplastic responses, and ameliorate the disease symptoms. The review highlights personalized microbiome-based algorithms, underpinned by integrated multi-omics technologies and machine-learning-driven diagnostics. Future research should address underlying microbial mechanisms and perform large, randomized controlled trials in order to establish microbiota-based therapies for neurological disorders.

[PMID: 41186436] The orbitofrontal cortex is central to decision making, reward valuation, emotional regulation, and goal-directed behavior. Although traditional cytoarchitectonic classifications, such as Brodmann map, identified multiple cortical areas within the orbitofrontal cortex, recent neuroimaging advancements such as the Human Connectome Project have refined our anatomical understanding in granular detail. This study characterizes the structural and functional connectivity of key orbitofrontal subregions, particularly Brodmann area 11, Brodmann area 13, Brodmann area 14, and Brodmann area 47, corresponding to Human Connectome Project areas 11L, 13L, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)/polar orbitofrontal cortex, and 47m/47 s/a47r, respectively. Structural connectivity analyses reveal significant large white matter connections with the inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and pathways linking the OFC to the amygdala and temporal cortex. Functionally, 11L is involved in valuation and decision making, 13L contributes to emotion regulation, OFC/polar orbitofrontal cortex plays a key role in reward processing and self-referential cognition, and areas 47 m, 47 s, and a47r have a role in coordinating cognitive and emotional information, as well as language production and semantic processing. These subregions integrate sensory-affective information and support theory of mind and semantic processing. Disruptions in OFC connectivity contribute to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, inducing various symptoms of addiction, obesity, depression, Parkinson disease, and frontotemporal dementia, highlighting the relevance of our improved anatomical understanding of this region for targeted neuromodulation strategies. Importantly, this work leverages an anatomically precise nomenclature from the Human Connectome Project to refine our understanding of the OFC's connectivity, enabling more precise neuromodulatory targeting while improving the reproducibility and sharing of research findings of this region.

[PMID: 41186353] Retinal ischemia in diabetic retinopathy (DR) is caused by the apoptosis of capillary pericytes and endothelial cells. In this study, we investigated the role of the Parkinson-associated protein DJ-1 (PARK7) in retinal capillary degeneration. DJ-1 levels were measured in diabetic and non-diabetic human retinas by immunostaining and Western blotting. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were cultured in high glucose or with a cytokine mixture (CM). The effect of inhibition of DJ-1 in HREC with isatin on Nε-carboxymethyl lysine (CML), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), nuclear factor kappa (NF-κB), and cleaved caspase-3 was investigated. AAV2-PARK7, driven by the endothelial cell-specific Tie2 promoter, was intravitreally injected into the mouse's eyes, and the effect of the retinal transduced DJ-1 on capillaries was investigated following ischemia/reperfusion injury. DJ-1 levels were observed to be reduced in human retinas with DR and in HREC cultured under high-glucose conditions. Isatin treatment increased the CML and iNOS levels in HREC. Treatment of HREC with CM promoted nuclear translocation of NF-κB and activation of caspase-3; co-treatment with isatin further exacerbated these effects. Isatin treatment significantly suppressed the CM-induced Nrf2 translocation in HREC. Intravitreal injection of AAV2-tie2-PARK7 resulted in high expression of DJ-1 in retinal capillaries and significantly reduced formation of acellular capillaries from ischemia/reperfusion injury. The results suggest that DJ-1 protects retinal capillary endothelial cells from damage caused by hyperglycemia and ischemia and that enhancing DJ-1 activity could be a strategy for mitigating early retinal damage in DR.

[PMID: 41186289] While various psychological factors increase Parkinson's disease (PD) risk, delirium's role remains unexplored. This study examined whether delirium is associated with PD incidence and identified potential modifying factors. We conducted a matched cohort study using UK Biobank data, including 6,254 patients with first-time delirium and 31,270 matched unexposed individuals. Cox proportional hazards models assessed PD risk following delirium, evaluating effect modification by age, sex, education, BMI, depression, frailty, and polygenic risk scores. During follow-up (median: 1,011 days for exposed vs 1,678 days for unexposed), 2% of delirium patients developed PD vs 1% of controls. Delirium was associated with significantly increased PD risk (HR: 3.97; 95% CI: 2.97-5.33). Education level significantly modified this association, with higher education linked to greater risk (College: HR 6.57; Non-college: HR 3.70). Age, sex, BMI, frailty, and polygenic risk scores did not significantly alter the association. Delirium is a significant and potentially modifiable risk factor for PD, highlighting the clinical importance of its prevention and management, particularly in highly educated individuals.

[PMID: 41185962] Ageing is a complex biological process driven, in part, by inflammaging. Recent research identifies the ectodysplasin A2 receptor (EDA2R) as a key regulator of inflammaging and a novel biomarker of ageing, with its expression increasing with age across diverse tissues in humans and animal models. Elevated EDA2R gene expression is associated with accelerated ageing, cellular senescence, frailty, obesity, acne, radiation response and increased levels of inflammatory, renal, cardiac and vascular biomarkers. Similarly, elevated EDA2R protein levels, a critical component of the proteomic ageing clock, are associated with a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, dementia, Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, various cancers, osteoarthritis, digestive diseases, diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ear and eye diseases, renal impairment, systemic autoimmune diseases, anaemia, bacterial infections, myositis, frailty, accelerated biological ageing, shorter telomere length, decreased healthspan and longevity, higher all-cause mortality and overall poor health. Beyond serving as a biomarker, EDA2R actively drives ageing, as its overexpression induces inflammation and tissue damage, whereas its inhibition mitigates these effects. Mechanistically, EDA2R activates non-canonical and canonical NF-κB signalling, promoting pro-inflammatory and catabolic processes that accelerate ageing phenotypes. Genetic variants of EDA2R are linked to alopecia, facial ageing, lipid profiles and prostate cancer. This review explores the structure and function of the EDA2R gene and protein, its role in tissue-specific ageing, and its therapeutic potential for multiple diseases. Although specific EDA2R antagonists are not yet available, interventions like calorie restriction, physical activity and specific supplements show promise in lowering EDA2R levels.",10
Inhibiting focal adhesion formation enables cells to convert mechanical strain into eventual scarring.,focal adhesion inhibition AND mechanical strain AND scarring AND cellular response,"16155910,11468280,41187349,41187304,41187293,41187266,41187245,41187220,41187197,41187163","[PMID: 16155910] Clinicians have observed that keloids preferentially form in body areas subject to increased skin tension. We hypothesized a difference exists in the transcriptional response of keloid fibroblasts to mechanical strain compared with normal fibroblasts. Normal and keloid fibroblasts were seeded in a device calibrated to deliver a known level of equibiaxial strain. We examined the transcriptional response of TGF-beta isoforms and collagen Ialpha, genes differentially expressed in keloids. Keloid fibroblasts produced more mRNA for TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and collagen Ialpha after mechanical strain compared to normals, and this was correlated with protein production. Inhibiting the major mechanical signal transduction pathway with the ERK inhibitor, U0126, blocked upregulation of gene expression. In addition, keloid fibroblasts formed more focal adhesion complexes as measured by immunofluorescence for focal adhesion kinase, integrin beta1, and vinculin. Finally, there is increased activation of focal adhesion kinase when we detected the phosphorylated form of focal adhesion kinase with immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. In summary, keloid fibroblasts have an exaggerated response to mechanical strain compared to normal fibroblasts leading to increased production of pro-fibrotic growth factors. This may be one molecular mechanism for the development of keloids.

[PMID: 11468280] Fibroblasts are subjected to changes of the mechanical force balance during physiological as well as pathological situations, such as wound healing, development of hypertrophic scars, and fibrogenesis. However, the molecular response and the changes in fibroblast gene expression upon mechanical stimulation remain poorly understood. As an in vitro model, human dermal fibroblasts were cultured within a three-dimensional network of fibrillar collagen either under high (stressed) or low tension (relaxed). cDNA microarray technology in combination with Northern blot analysis led to identification of mechano-responsive genes coding for extracellular matrix proteins, fibrogenic growth factors, protease inhibitors, components of focal adhesions, and the cytoskeleton. Application of biaxial strain to fibroblasts cultured on flexible silicone membranes revealed that the type of strain as well as the properties of the substrate induced different patterns of gene regulation. The transcriptional profile of mechanically induced genes in collagen lattices suggests that mechanical stimuli lead to a ""synthetic"" fibroblast phenotype characterized by induction of connective tissue synthesis while simultaneously inhibiting matrix degradation.

[PMID: 41187349] The material properties of the high-quality MAPbI3 (FAPbI3) based thin films were optimized using a linear organic (carbon ring) based antisolvent in order to understand the photovoltaic performance of resultant solar cells. We found that the miscible and immiscible antisolvents influenced the nucleation kinetics and crystal growth of the perovskite thin films, thereby determining the photovoltaic responses. The photovoltaic responses of the MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 based solar cells are better when the miscible chlorobenzene and immiscible diethyl ether (DE) are used as the antisolvent, respectively. It is noted that a high power conversion efficiency of 20.8% can be achieved in the FA based mixed perovskite solar cells fabricated with the immiscible DE. The findings from this study should assist in establishing reproducible fabrication processes for various perovskite-related solar cells.

[PMID: 41187304] Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) represents a complex interplay of pathophysiological processes that create a self-perpetuating cycle of heart and kidney dysfunction. While it is clearly understood how hemodynamic changes connect pathogenesis in the two organs, other processes are also in play. Some are the structural changes involving both the cellular and extracellular compartments that precede functional alterations. Fibrosis, which is initiated by an inflammatory response triggering myofibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix production, is a common denominator of heart and kidney pathology in CRS. This review focuses on fibroblast activities as a crucial factor in disease onset and progression in CRS. We explore how fibrosis in one organ can trigger or worsen dysfunction in the other organ, and we describe the key pathological signaling pathways of cardiorenal fibrosis, the extracellular matrix-derived biomarkers that can aid clinical management and drug development, and the therapeutic opportunities that can be beneficial in CRS by targeting fibroblast activities.

[PMID: 41187293] Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fatal disease. Current clinically approved treatments slow disease progression but are not curative. Thus, there is a critical need to better define the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF and develop novel approaches to treat this devastating lung condition. Immune dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, accompanied by fibrosis, constitutes a key hallmark of IPF. IPF is generally considered to be a fibroproliferative disorder rather than an immune condition because, historically, immunomodulatory therapies have failed to produce significant clinical effect. This lack of response is frustrating given that there is evidence of immune dysfunction in IPF and highlights the need to clarify the role of immune cells and inflammatory pathways in IPF. There is increasing evidence that the extracellular matrix (ECM) directs cell fate and function, and we propose that ECM remodeling and immune dysfunction in IPF generate a self-perpetuating fibrotic circuit that is refractory to classical anti-inflammatory agents. Understanding the relationship between ECM and immune dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis could help identify novel therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease.

[PMID: 41187266] In the zebrafish retina, incident light undergoes wavelength-dependent processing encompassing mechanisms such as color opponency, contrast enhancement, and motion detection prior to neural transmission to the brain proper. In darkness, photoreceptors continuously release glutamate into the synaptic cleft, a process that diminishes in response to increased light intensity, thereby conveying visual signals to ON and OFF bipolar cells. Specifically, in zebrafish, the ON pathway signal transduction is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 6b (mGluR6b) and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs). Here, we demonstrate that the knockout of <i>eaat5b</i> and <i>eaat7</i> disrupts electroretinogram responses to short and long-wavelength stimuli while preserving middle-wavelength responses, suggesting wavelength-specific roles. We found differential expression of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in the outer plexiform layer, particularly in the strike zone, crucial for prey capture, supporting task-specific involvement of these signaling pathways. In order to investigate this, we developed a virtual hunting assay using UV light stimuli. Such a behavioral assay targeting short and long wavelengths indicates that EAAT5b and EAAT7 influence UV-dependent prey detection and motion sensing differently. Our findings highlight the importance of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in modulating light integration dynamics in the zebrafish retina.

[PMID: 41187245] Identifying the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a cornerstone of preventive medical care. Despite its significance, limited research has explored ASCVD risk in individuals with fibrotic skin diseases. This study aims to evaluate the risk of ASCVD in patients diagnosed with fibrotic skin conditions. We utilized the TriNetX platform to analyze ASCVD risk associated with fibrotic skin conditions. Propensity score-matched (PSM) cohorts were constructed to adjust for confounding. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Patients with fibrotic skin diseases demonstrated an elevated risk of ASCVD. Scleroderma was most strongly associated with ASCVD risk (HR 2.51 [95% CI: 1.97,3.21]), followed by hypertrophic scar (HR 1.40 [95% CI: 1.20,1.63]). Elevated risks were also observed for morphea (HR 1.36 [95% CI: 1.03,1.08]) and lichen sclerosis (HR 1.30 [95% CI: 1.04,1.62]). Individuals with fibrotic skin conditions, including scleroderma, hypertrophic scars, morphea, and lichen sclerosis, demonstrate an increased risk of ASCVD. These findings highlight the significance of recognizing fibrotic skin diseases as possible indicators of systemic inflammation.

[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187197] The type I interferon (IFN-I) response, which includes IFN-I induction and signaling, plays an important role in a host's defence against viral infections. Many pathogenic viruses target it to evade the host immunity. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), the causative agent of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, which features high mortality in humans, has been reported in southeastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Although a previous study reported that CCHFV antagonizes IFN-I signaling in human cell lines, it is unclear how it inhibits IFN-I signaling. Here we demonstrated that the non-structural protein of CCHFV, NSm, suppresses IFN-I signaling in human cell lines. Furthermore, we discovered that NSm binds to STAT2, an important host protein in IFN-I signaling, and induces its degradation within cells. Taken together, our results imply that NSm suppresses IFN-I signaling by targeting human STAT2.

[PMID: 41187163] North American monarch (Danaus plexippus) populations have experienced sharp declines. Loss of milkweed is among the major drivers of this decline. Our objective is to identify factors that influence milkweed habitat quality for monarchs to inform habitat reconstruction efforts. We measured the response of monarch egg abundance to milkweed patch characteristics (milkweed species identity and co-occurring insects) and features of the surrounding landscape (wildflower nectar plants and land use context). From May through September 2019 and 2021, we assessed the abundance of naturally occurring monarch eggs, lady beetles (predators), and aphids (competitors) on swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) and common milkweed (A. syriaca) plants established in a diverse matrix of wildflower nectar plants or monoculture of fescue grass and located in open row crop habitats or abutting wooded edges. We found that local patch characteristics had the largest effects on monarch egg abundance. Egg abundance differed across milkweed species, but the milkweed species with the highest monarch egg abundance switched from common milkweed in 2019 to swamp milkweed in 2021. We also found that monarch egg abundance was positively associated with oleander aphid (Aphis nerii) abundance on both milkweed species, despite significantly higher aphid abundance on swamp milkweed than common milkweed. Lady beetles exhibited a numerical response to oleander aphid prey, but there was no evidence that greater numbers of these generalist predators negatively affected monarch eggs. Landscape features also influenced monarch egg abundance, but the effects varied across milkweed species and years. In 2019, egg abundance was higher on swamp milkweed near trees than in open crop fields, while proximity to wildflower nectar plants increased egg abundance on common milkweed; landscape features did not directly affect egg abundance in 2021. Our results highlight the important role of environmental context in mediating the conservation value of milkweed plantings for monarchs.",10

Recent studies have examined the importance of the heterogeneity of tissue resident fibroblasts and mechanical signalling pathways in healing and fibrosis. However, tissue repair and the inflammatory response also involves blood cells that are recruited from the circulation. Here we identify mechanoresponsive myeloid subpopulations present in scar and unwounded skin. We then modulate these subpopulations by manipulating mechanical strain in vivo and in vitro and find that specifically targeting myeloid mechanical signalling is sufficient to reduce the pro-fibrotic myeloid subpopulations and restore the native, anti-inflammatory subpopulations. In addition, myeloid-specific mechanotransduction ablation also downregulates downstream pro-fibrotic fibroblast transcriptional profiles, reducing scar formation. As inflammatory cells circulate and home to injury sites during the initial healing phases in all organs, focusing on mechanoresponsive myeloid subpopulations may generate additional directions for systemic immunomodulatory therapies to target fibrosis and other diseases across other internal organ systems.

[PMID: 34544267] <b>Objective:</b> Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease that affects 63 in every 100,000 Americans. Its etiology remains unknown, although inflammatory pathways appear to be important. Given the dynamic environment of the lung, we examined the significance of mechanotransduction on both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling during IPF. <b>Innovation:</b> Mechanotransduction pathways have not been thoroughly examined in the context of lung disease, and pharmacologic approaches for IPF do not currently target these pathways. The interplay between mechanical strain and inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis remains incompletely understood. <b>Approach:</b> In this study, we used conditional KO mice to block mechanotransduction by knocking out Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) expression in fibroblasts, followed by induction of pulmonary fibrosis using bleomycin. We examined both normal human and human IPF fibroblasts and used immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western Blot to evaluate the effects of FAK inhibitor (FAK-I) on modulating fibrotic and inflammatory genes. <b>Results:</b> Our data indicate that the deletion of FAK in mice reduces expression of fibrotic and inflammatory genes in lungs. Similarly, mechanical straining in normal human lung fibroblasts activates inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. The FAK inhibition decreases these signals but has a less effect on IPF fibroblasts as compared with normal human fibroblasts. <b>Conclusion:</b> Administering FAK-I at early stages of fibrosis may attenuate the FAK-mediated fibrotic response pathway in IPF, potentially mediating disease progression.

[PMID: 21986284] Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key aspect of myocardial response to biomechanical stress and heart failure. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) regulate the ECM turnover through negative regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the ECM structural proteins. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 is unique among TIMPs in activating pro-MMP2 in addition to inhibiting a number of MMPs. Given this dual role of TIMP2, we investigated whether TIMP2 serves a critical role in heart disease. Pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in 8-week-old male mice resulted in greater left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, dilation, and dysfunction in TIMP2-deficient (TIMP2(-/-)) compared with wild-type mice at 2 weeks and 5 weeks post-TAC. Despite lack of MMP2 activation, total collagenase activity and specific membrane type MMP activity were greater in TIMP2(-/-)-TAC hearts. Loss of TIMP2 resulted in a marked reduction of integrin β1D levels and compromised focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, resulting in impaired adhesion of cardiomyocytes to ECM proteins, laminin, and fibronectin. Nonuniform ECM remodeling in TIMP2(-/-)-TAC hearts revealed degraded network structure as well as excess fibrillar deposition. Greater fibrosis in TIMP2(-/-)-TAC compared with wild-type TAC hearts was due to higher levels of SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) and posttranslational stabilization of collagen fibers rather than increased collagen synthesis. Inhibition of MMPs including membrane type MMP significantly reduced left ventricular dilation and dysfunction, hypertrophy, and fibrosis in TIMP2(-/-)-TAC mice. Lack of TIMP2 leads to exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and remodeling after pressure overload because of excess activity of membrane type MMP and loss of integrin β1D, leading to nonuniform ECM remodeling and impaired myocyte-ECM interaction.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187370] An improved route to the indolequinone pharmacophore is described based on the reaction of bromobenzoquinones with enamines. Through the implementation of small changes in the reaction conditions, the reaction conditions were much improved with quantities of copper salt, base, and acetonitrile solvent all reduced compared with the original method. The resulting indolequinone-3-carboxylates were subsequently converted into novel indolequinones as potential inhibitors of the quinone reductase enzyme NQO2. A number of potent, mechanism-based inhibitors were identified, increasing our understanding of structure-activity relationships for inhibition of this enzyme.

[PMID: 41187366] The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, primarily through mechanisms involving carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Aberrant FGFR1 signalling has been implicated in various cancers, including lung, breast, neck and urothelial carcinoma. Despite the recognized oncogenic potential of FGFR1, therapeutic strategies targeting its kinase domain remain inadequately explored. This underscores an urgent need for the development of novel FGFR1 inhibitors, particularly through de novo drug design approaches, to effectively counteract FGFR1-driven malignancies. This research aims to develop novel FGFR1 inhibitors through a multi-step approach involving fragment-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and density functional theory studies (DFT), with the goal of targeting FGFR1's kinase binding domain to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Initially, known FGFR inhibitor molecules were retrieved and subjected to fragment-based drug designing and virtual screening. Through thorough analysis, molecules containing the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold were identified as promising candidates. A pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based database containing 90,952 molecules was subsequently retrieved from PubChem and filtered using molecular docking-based virtual screening resulting 94 molecules having better binding affinity than derazantinib, reference drug. After pharmacokinetic profiling (ADME), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) studies, out of 94 molecules only 11 compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and superior MM-GBSA binding free energies were selected. Docking-based screening revealed that selected 11 compounds demonstrated better binding scores than the reference drug, derazantinib. Among them, HIT1, was selected for 150ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess its conformational stability. DFT calculations further confirmed its bio-feasibility by analyzing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Overall, the selected lead compounds exhibited enhanced binding affinity, superior conformational stability, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to derazantinib. Present findings suggest that the identified hit molecules hold strong potential for inhibiting FGFR1's kinase domain and disrupting FGFR-associated tumor angiogenesis.

[PMID: 41187361] To explore the mechanism of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa on the accumulation of γ-glutamyl peptides and taste development in Jinhua ham, the influences of R. mucilaginosa on fungal community structure, functional enzyme gene expression, key enzyme activities, γ-glutamyl peptides accumulation and taste attributes were investigated during the dry-ripening. In comparison with Pichia kudriavzevii XS-5 (PK), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa XZY63-3 (RX) and no inoculation (CK), the inoculation with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa EIODSF019 (RE) showed the highest overall acceptance and richness. Metagenomics revealed that RE inoculation inhibited Aspergillus abundance, and the profile of Rhodotorula reached 45.94 % at genus level. The treatment of RE increased the gene abundance of amino acid metabolism pathways; the expression levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase gene in RE were increased by 83.27 % compared with CK, and the activities of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase increased from 214 U/g proteins of CK to 567 U/g proteins of RE. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the total contents of γ-glutamyl peptides increased from 136.40 μg/g of CK to 518.18 μg/g of RE. Partial least squares regression and correlation analysis indicated that γ-Glu-Cys and γ-Glu-Gln were mainly responsible for the improvement of overall acceptance and richness of Jinhua ham with RE inoculation.

[PMID: 41187334] Hexokinase domain containing protein 1 (HKDC1) is a recently discovered fifth human hexokinase isozyme that is significantly upregulated in several disease states, including lung and liver cancers. Cellular studies suggest that HKDC1 is a low activity hexokinase; however, its functional characteristics have remained enigmatic. Here, we describe the kinetic and regulatory features of recombinant human HKDC1, demonstrating it to be a robust hexokinase (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub> = 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) with a unique glucose <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value (0.49 ± 0.07 mM) that differs markedly from all other human hexokinase isozymes. The isolated C-terminal domain of HKDC1 displays kinetic characteristics nearly identical to the full-length enzyme, whereas the N-terminal domain is inactive. Unlike all other 100 kDa vertebrate hexokinases characterized to date, HKDC1 is insensitive to product inhibition by physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate, with apparent inhibition constants above 1 mM. The hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is also insensitive to Dinaciclib, a pan cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that reportedly disrupts the ability of nuclear localized HKDC1 to phosphorylate retinoblastoma-binding protein 5. Conversely, the hexokinase activity of HKDC1 is potently inhibited by a synthetic glucosamine derivative previously developed for hexokinase 1 and 2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 103 ± 6 nM. An HKDC1 variant associated with retinitis pigmentosa, T58M, displays a modest, but statistically significant 2-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m,glucose</sub>) compared to the wild-type enzyme. Together, our results provide a detailed functional characterization of recombinant HKDC1 and set the stage for investigating the link between HKDC1 catalysis and human disease.

Hepatocyte apoptosis leads to liver injury and fibrosis, while inflammation exacerbates damage through immune cells and cytokines. Lipogenesis promotes fat accumulation and lipotoxicity, stressing hepatocytes, whereas insulin resistance impairs glucose metabolism and exacerbates dysfunction. Highlight the complexity of NASH and the need for multi-targeted therapies are highlighted by these interrelated processes. Using in silico transcriptomic analysis, this study identifies key microRNAs (miRNAs) in NASH and explores the relationship between miRNAs and circ-MYO9B in NASH. To find differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), miRNA expression profiles from the liver and blood datasets (GSE33857, GSE59492, and GSE49012) were examined. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced cirrhosis (NASH-CH)-related miRNA modules were discovered by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). RT-qPCR was used on tissue and blood samples to examine the expression and interaction of circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p in NASH patients, and dual-luciferase assays confirmed their direct interaction. Circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p were found to be significantly correlated in both blood and liver tissue in NASH-CH patients, according to expression analysis. RT-qPCR analysis validated their dysregulation, suggesting their role in the advancement of the disease. The direct interaction between circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p was confirmed by the dual-luciferase assay, indicating a regulatory function in metabolic pathways. By modulating this miRNA, circ-MYO9B may influence downstream pathways in which miR-193b-5p is known to be involved, such as lipogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that circ-MYO9B may represent a potential therapeutic target for addressing metabolic dysfunction associated with NASH, although further validation in hepatocyte-specific models is warranted.

[PMID: 41186486] The Qing-Re-Yi-Liu decoction (QRYLD) is a clinically effective prescription for treatment of breast cancer. Our preliminary studies found that QRYLD treatment interfered with the Warburg effect in breast cancer cells. However, its chemical components and molecular mechanisms have not been clarified. This study analyzed the bioactive components of QRYLD aqueous extracts by HPLC. The effects of QRYLD on the malignant behaviors of MCF-7 cells and potential mechanisms were analyzed by CCK-8, transwell invasion, wound-healing assays, flow cytometry, Western blot assays and transcriptomic analysis as well as in vivo mouse tumor model. QRYLD aqueous extracts contained several bioactive components. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that QRYLD treatment altered the expression of several genes involved in biological processes and signaling pathways, such as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Functionally, QRYLD, similar to MnSOD silencing, inhibited the malignant behaviors of MCF-7 cells and enhanced their apoptosis, whereas MnSOD overexpression had the opposite effects. Moreover, QRYLD treatment inhibited the Warburg effect by limiting glucose uptake and lactic acid production, and decreasing the relative expression of glucose transporter-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, c-Myc, hexokinase-2, phosphofructokinase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, pyruvate kinase isozyme 2, MnSOD, calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in MCF-7 cells. Finally, treatment with QRYLD significantly inhibited the growth of xenografted MCF-7 tumors in mice and reduced the tumor expression of MnSOD, CaMKII, and AMPK. These data suggest that QRYLD may target MnSOD to attenuate the MnSOD/CaMKII/AMPK signaling, inhibiting the Warburg effect and malignant behaviors in breast cancer.

[PMID: 41186291] Wheat germ-derived bioactive peptides have attracted substantial attention for their antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties. However, their potential roles and mechanisms in mitigating osteoporosis remain unclear. This study investigated the antiosteoporotic effects of RPPSFF (RPP), a bioactive peptide isolated from wheat germ, and elucidated its molecular mechanism in maintaining bone homeostasis. Using a mouse model of D-galactose-induced aging and an MC3T3-E1 osteoblast model of senescence, we found that RPP significantly enhanced osteogenesis, inhibited bone resorption, and improved systemic antioxidant capacity and bone microarchitecture. Mechanistic analysis through siRNA-mediated gene silencing, pull-down assay, and molecular docking revealed that RPP directly binds to the transcription factor YY1, thereby activating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway. These findings indicate that RPP modulates oxidative stress and bone metabolism through the YY1/AMPK/SIRT1 pathway, providing a basis for the development of peptide-based nutritional interventions for age-related osteoporosis.

Firstly, a single-factor experiment followed by an orthogonal test indicated the optimum factors, such as 30°C for 36 h, a 10% inoculation amount, and a 65% solid-liquid ratio for producing FCRW containing a 12.24% protein. A total of 180 common carp, with an average initial weight of 26.99 ± 4.04 g, were randomly allocated into 12 tanks, with each tank housing 15 individuals. The initial group functioned as the control group (CG) and was provided with a basal diet; meanwhile, the remaining three groups were fed high-fat (HF) diets supplemented with various levels of FCRW, 0%, 5%, and 15% for HF, HF-L, and HF-H, respectively. The feeding trial was prolonged to 56 days. The results of the feeding trial demonstrated that the fish group receiving an HF diet supplemented with a greater proportion of FCRW (15%) exhibited superior growth and feed efficiency. Both 5% and 15% FCRW significantly reduced VSI and HSI, while 15% FCRW increased whole-body crude protein and decreased body/liver lipids. FCRW supplementation also lowered serum/liver triglycerides and serum LDL-C. Additionally, all FCRW levels enhanced antioxidant markers (MDA, AKP, CAT, superoxide dismutase [SOD]) and innate immunity (LZM). Histology showed reduced hepatocyte vacuolation and lipid droplets. Crucially, 15% FCRW upregulated lipolysis genes (<i>lpl</i>, <i>hsl</i>, <i>ppar-α</i>) and downregulated lipogenesis genes (<i>acc-α</i>, <i>fas</i>, <i>ppar-γ</i>). Regarding intestinal structural integrity, FCRW improved intestinal morphology and upregulated barrier genes (<i>occludin</i>, <i>claudin-3</i>, <i>zo-1</i>). It suppressed proinflammatory cytokines (<i>il-1β</i>, <i>il-6</i>) and activated anti-inflammatory pathways (<i>il-10</i>, <i>tgf-β</i>, <i>tlr4</i>, <i>nf-κb</i>). Gut microbiota analysis revealed increased beneficial bacteria (e.g., <i>Firmicutes</i>).

[PMID: 41185514] Doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, is effective against various malignancies, but its clinical application is limited by cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. The objective of this review is to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms involved in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) and evaluate the cardioprotective potential of plant-derived bioactive compounds. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies published in the last two decades. Emphasis was placed on experimental and preclinical models that investigated molecular pathways of DIC and the therapeutic role of phytochemicals. DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated through a cascade of molecular events, including excessive oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, impaired autophagy, and altered activity of signaling pathways, such as AMPK, Nrf2, TGF-β1/Smad2, and HIF-1α. Epigenetic dysregulation also contributes to myocardial injury. Phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and alkaloids, have shown significant cardioprotective effects. These compounds exert their actions by modulating redox homeostasis, preserving mitochondrial function, regulating apoptotic markers, and restoring signaling imbalances. The pleiotropic nature of phytocompounds enables them to target multiple pathological mechanisms associated with DIC. Despite promising in vitro and in vivo evidence, limitations, such as poor bioavailability, lack of standardized dosing, and inadequate clinical data, hinder their translational potential. Novel delivery systems and well-controlled clinical trials are necessary to overcome these challenges. Plant-derived bioactive compounds show potential in mitigating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, as supported by preclinical evidence. However, further translational studies are warranted to validate these findings, optimize pharmacokinetics, and evaluate their feasibility in clinical oncology settings.

[PMID: 41185375] Numerous epidemiological studies have found that tea consumption has an anti-aging and preventive effect on age-related diseases. The question of which tea possesses the most potent anti-aging properties and the underlying mechanisms of these effects remains largely obscure. To explore which type of tea has the strongest anti-aging activity and its mechanism of action. The Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) longevity and stress tests were used to evaluate the anti-aging activities of six types of tea. Additionally, ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was employed to compare the differences in anti-aging-related chemical components among these teas. These analyses were conducted to identify the tea with the strongest anti-aging activity and to further explore its underlying molecular mechanisms. All the extracts of tea (200 μg/mL) prolonged life and enhanced stress resistance. Surprisingly, dark tea (DT) had significant anti-aging efficacy. Furthermore, this study found that anti-aging mechanisms of DT include (a) DT modulated the IGF-1 signaling pathway (IIS), SKN-1 and HSF-1 stress resistance pathway, and the AMPK/SIRT1/FOXO signaling pathway. (b) DT upregulated skn-1 and ftn-1 expression, decreased Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels, and inhibited ferroptosis. (c) DT preserved the integrity and functionality of mitochondria. This study demonstrated that DT significantly extended lifespan by enhancing antioxidant capacity, maintaining mitochondrial function and suppressing ferroptosis in C. elegans. These anti-aging effects mediated by multiple mechanisms. Furthermore, the anti-aging properties of DT are partly attributed to its high flavonoid levels.

[PMID: 41184824] To analyze the lipidomic profile of ESCC patients, link changes in cancer lipid metabolism to gene expression changes, and provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of ESCC patients in the Kazakh Xinjiang ethnic group. By integrating the lipidome and transcriptome results, genes related to differential lipid metabolites in Kazakh ESCC patients were identified, and the effects of the key gene AMPK on lipid metabolism in ESCC cells were investigated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC‒MS/MS). Through absolute lipid quantification analysis of two serum samples, 13 classes of lipids were detected, with triglycerides (TAGs) being the most abundant. Phosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and ceramide (Cer) were the lipid categories with significant differences between the two groups. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes related to fatty acid synthesis, carnitine biosynthesis, and other lipid metabolism pathways were enriched in the tumor tissue. Integrative analysis of the two groups suggested that fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, lipid degradation, cholesterol metabolism, and the AMPK signaling pathway were enriched in tumor tissue. UPLC‒MS/MS was used to perform targeted lipidomic analysis of AMPK-knockdown esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells, suggesting that AMPK may be involved in the reprogramming of lipid metabolism in Kazakh ESCC patients. Lipid metabolic reprogramming occurs in the tumor tissue of Kazakh ESCC patients, and there is a correlation between AMPK activity and lipid metabolism, which suggests a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Kazakh ESCC.

[PMID: 41184651] This study aims to evaluate the protective effect of buspirone (BUS) against liver damage caused by cyclophosphamide (CPA) by focusing on the α-klotho/Nrf2/HO-1 and AMPK/NF-κB p65/NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling cascades. The possible damage that CPA might produce was evaluated using histological examination in conjunction with serum AST, ALT, and direct bilirubin. GSH and MDA levels were measured using a colorimetric technique. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels, as well as hepatic caspase-1, hepatic p-AMPK, and serum α-klotho, were measured using the ELISA technique. Using an immunohistochemistry method, the Nrf2 and caspase-3 expression in the liver tissue was investigated. The expression of HO-1 mRNA was assessed by means of RT-qPCR. The expression levels of NF-κB p65 and NLRP3 were assessed by western blotting. BUS, in a dose-dependent manner, attenuated CPA-induced hepatotoxicity by reducing the elevated serum AST, ALT, and direct bilirubin and alleviating the histopathological aberrations. Additionally, it raised GSH levels and decreased MDA levels. In addition, it reduced levels of inflammatory markers and caspase-3 expression. BUS also increased p-AMPK and α-klotho protein levels and stimulated the production of Nrf2 and HO-1. Additionally, it reduced pyroptosis by downregulating NLRP3 and caspase-1 expression levels. BUS attenuated NF-κB p65/NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-3-mediated apoptotic activity and enhanced Nrf2/HO-1 activity, therefore mitigating the liver impairment provoked by CPA.

[PMID: 41184229] Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) metabolism is independently regulated in different compartments in endothelial cells (EC). The metabolic profile and functional impact of NADPH during EC senescence remain largely unknown. Using a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator, we find that cytosolic, but not mitochondrial, NADPH level increases during EC senescence. Upregulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) further elevates cytosolic NADPH level during EC senescence. Suppression of G6PD S-nitrosylation at C385 potentiates G6PD activity. G6PD overexpression alleviates, while its knockdown aggravates, vascular aging. NADPH is indispensable for G6PD to protect against vascular aging through increasing reduced glutathione and inhibiting HDAC3 activity. Among 1419 FDA-approved drugs, folic acid, catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase to generate NADPH, effectively alleviates vascular aging in angiotensin II-infused mice and naturally aged mice. The connection between NADPH metabolism and EC senescence provides a unique angle for understanding vascular aging and an efficient target for therapy.

[PMID: 41183743] High-fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid metabolism abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Although exercise can improve lipid metabolism abnormalities, its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study used Drosophila as a model to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of exercise on HFD-induced lipid metabolism abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction. Results showed that HFD caused lipid accumulation, impaired cardiac contractility, and arrhythmia in fly, accompanied by upregulation of dLipin expression and suppression of the AMPK-PGC-1α signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes. Exercise intervention activated the AMPK-PGC-1α axis to transcriptionally inhibit dLipin, thereby improving HFD-induced lipid metabolism abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction. Knockdown experiments confirmed that dLipin knockdown in cardiomyocytes protected against HFD-induced lipid metabolic abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction, while PGC-1α knockdown blocked the inhibitory effect of exercise on dLipin and its cardiac protective effects. This study reveals that exercise improves HFD-induced lipid metabolic abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction through the AMPK-PGC-1α/dLipin pathway, providing a new strategy for targeted treatment of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases.",10
Integrated care is ineffective at tackling multiple comorbidities.,Integrated Care AND Comorbidity AND Effectiveness AND Chronic Disease Management,"41178486,41170702,41166057,41069972,41054685,41019866,40991317,40987143,40923583,40921578","[PMID: 41178486] Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and asthma often coexist and share common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This study addresses challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of multimorbid patients with CRSwNP and asthma providing new insights for their management. Using a modified Delphi method, a scientific board of 40 Italian clinicians (pulmonologists, allergists/clinical immunologists, and ear, nose, and throat specialists) developed consensus statements regarding the multimorbid patient with severe CRSwNP and asthma and including the disease burden, assessment, treatment and multidisciplinary management of multimorbid patients. All statements reached consensus. Experts acknowledged the substantial disease burden, the key pathophysiological role of type 2 inflammation in multimorbid patients and the need for multidisciplinary care. The use of biologics represents a highly effective therapeutic opportunity for patients with comorbidities, optimising overall outcomes. Integrated care pathways and regular multidisciplinary re-assessment were deemed essential for treatment decisions and improved care in multimorbid patients. This consensus highlights the value of a multidisciplinary approach for multimorbid CRSwNP and asthma patients, advocating for endotype-driven therapies and standardised pathways in clinical practice.

[PMID: 41170702] Bronchiectasis is a chronic, complex, and heterogeneous respiratory disease characterized by irreversible bronchial dilation, persistent airway inflammation, and recurrent infections. Traditionally viewed from a lung-centered perspective, its pathophysiology has been explained by the ""vicious cycle"" hypothesis, later refined into the more dynamic concept of the ""vicious vortex."" However, emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of comorbidities in influencing disease progression, symptom burden, and prognosis. This review explores the evolving understanding of bronchiectasis by integrating comorbidities into current pathophysiological frameworks. We illustrate how coexisting conditions interact with components of the vicious vortex, amplifying airway inflammation, impairing host defenses, and disrupting clearance mechanisms. We summarize evidence on the prevalence, clinical impact, and prognostic significance of key comorbidities and discuss their implications for patient management. Finally, we emphasize the importance of an integrated, multidisciplinary approach and the emerging role of the treatable traits framework, which focuses on identifying clinically relevant, biologically measurable, and modifiable traits-regardless of whether they are etiological or nonetiological. In this sense, we propose a conceptual ""Copernican Revolution"" in bronchiectasis care: recognizing comorbidities not as secondary features, but as potential drivers of disease trajectory. By adopting this pragmatic strategy, clinicians can optimize quality of life, achieve patient-centered care, and improve outcomes in this condition.

[PMID: 41166057] Bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease marked by recurrent infections, progressive inflammation, and declining pulmonary function. While pharmacologic therapies remain central to management, nonpharmacologic strategies-particularly nutrition and physical activity-are underutilized, despite growing evidence. This review examines the role of nutritional support and physical activity in managing bronchiectasis, highlighting their impact on frailty, systemic inflammation, and functional outcomes. Frailty is increasingly recognized in bronchiectasis, particularly in patients with comorbid nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (NTM-LD), where prevalence may exceed 40%. Malnutrition, low body mass index (BMI), and sarcopenia are associated with poorer lung function, increased hospitalizations, and mortality. Meanwhile, physical inactivity-measured by low step count and prolonged sedentary time-is a strong predictor of exacerbation risk and healthcare utilization. Evidence supports the use of high-calorie, protein-rich diets and resistance-based exercise training to improve muscle mass, immune function, and quality of life. Synergistic effects are observed when nutritional interventions are combined with pulmonary rehabilitation. However, barriers to implementation remain, including a lack of access, under-referral, and limited emphasis on guidelines. Nutritional and physical activity interventions offer measurable clinical benefits in bronchiectasis and should be integrated into routine multidisciplinary care. Future research should prioritize the validation of frailty screening tools, the implementation of effective strategies, and the development of policy mechanisms to expand coverage for dietetic and rehabilitation services.

[PMID: 41069972] Multimorbidity, the coexistence of two or more chronic non-communicable diseases, poses a significant health challenge in India, particularly among older adults. Factors such as population ageing, lifestyle changes and urbanisation have led to an increasing burden of chronic diseases. Data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health Wave 2, which surveyed 11 818 individuals in India, were utilised, focusing on those aged 50 and above. The analysis included 7118 participants after excluding those with missing or incorrect data. The prevalence and patterns of multimorbidity were assessed by examining the co-occurrence of eight chronic conditions: arthritis, stroke, angina, diabetes, chronic lung disease, asthma, depression and hypertension. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA software to determine the frequency and chronicity of these conditions. The prevalence of multimorbidity was 45.14%, with hypertension (22%) and arthritis (19%) being the most common conditions. Hypertension also showed the highest chronicity, often being the first diagnosed condition. Significant patterns of dyads and triads were identified, with hypertension frequently co-occurring with other chronic conditions. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of multimorbidity among older adults in India, revealing a high prevalence of conditions like hypertension and arthritis. The findings highlight the substantial burden of multimorbidity, with significant implications for healthcare management. The study underscores the need for integrated, patient-centred care models to manage multimorbidity effectively. These insights are crucial for developing targeted interventions and health policies aimed at improving care coordination and outcomes for individuals with multiple chronic conditions in India.

[PMID: 41054685] Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, and multifactorial disease with rising prevalence and substantial health and economic burdens. Despite significant advances in both medical and surgical treatments, clinicians and patients still face a lack of clear, comparative guidance for tailoring therapy based on individual risk factors, disease severity, and comorbidities. This review synthesizes current evidence on lifestyle and behavioral interventions, pharmacologic therapies (including glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists), and surgical approaches. Key clinical considerations in treatment selection include body mass index, eligibility for surgical or non-surgical interventions, patient preferences, tolerance for side effects, and the long-term impact on quality of life. While lifestyle and behavioral modifications alone pose minimal risks, they are considerably less effective than when combined with pharmacologic or surgical/endoscopic treatments. Current pharmacotherapies, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual agonists such as tirzepatide, represent a paradigm shift in non-surgical weight management, though questions remain regarding their long-term efficacy and safety. Bariatric surgery offers the most effective and durable weight loss outcomes, significantly improving obesity-related comorbidities and long-term survival. However, it carries higher upfront risks, potential complications, nutritional deficiencies, and increased costs. Ultimately, integrated treatment models that combine lifestyle, pharmacologic, and/or surgical strategies are likely to offer the most effective and sustainable outcomes in managing obesity. Our review highlights the importance of an individualized, evidence-based, and multimodal strategy to effectively manage obesity and address its complexity. Continued research is essential to refine patient selection and improve integration of treatment options, ultimately supporting more personalized and effective obesity care.

[PMID: 40991317] Older adults living with physical chronic conditions and comorbid mental illness have more complex care needs, and may experience side effects of treatment for mental illness that can exacerbate physical conditions. There is a need to examine variation in health service use and chronic disease management in the context of treatment for mental illness. We compared evidence-informed management of diabetes, heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) amongst older adults based on history of mental illness treatment. We conducted a population-based propensity score-matched study in British Columbia, Canada, using health administrative data from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2023. Older adults (aged ≥65) registered for provincial health insurance and diagnosed with diabetes, heart failure and/or COPD. Within each chronic disease subgroup, propensity scores (matching for age, sex, rurality and neighbourhood income quintile) paired individuals 1:1 based on mental illness history. Differences in health service utilisation and chronic disease management outcomes were assessed from P-values. Older adults with mental illness history had more primary care contacts, virtual visits and contacts with their usual primary care provider and specialists. However, they also had fewer labs/testing and a lower likelihood of being dispensed drugs for their chronic condition than those without mental illness history. Despite more frequent contact with primary care, older adults with mental illness may face barriers to receiving comparable chronic disease management. These findings underscore the need for more integrated, multidisciplinary care models that address both mental and physical health needs.

[PMID: 40987143] Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, with a rising prevalence after the age of 70. Conventional hospitalization, commonly required in this frail population, exposes patients to numerous iatrogenic complications. Alternative care models, such as diuretic-based day hospital (DH) management, may help mitigate these risks. To describe the geriatric profile of patients treated for acute heart failure (AHF) in a diuretic day hospital within a cardiogeriatrics unit, and to report the organization of the associated care pathway. This was a retrospective, observational, monocentric study conducted in the cardiogeriatrics department of Hôpital La Porte Verte (Versailles, France). Patients aged ≥65 years who were treated in a diuretic day hospital for acute heart failure between January and June 2025 were included. Geriatric, cardiologic, and organizational data were collected from medical records. A purely descriptive analysis was performed. Forty patients were included, with a mean age of 88 ± 6.8 years. Most lived at home (95%) and had preserved autonomy (mean ADL score: 5.4). The average Charlson Comorbidity Index was 8.9 ± 2.3; 50% were at risk of malnutrition and 92.5% had chronic kidney disease. From a cardiologic standpoint, 57.5% had preserved LVEF and 67.5% had atrial fibrillation. The mean delay between referral and the first day hospital session was 1.6 days, with an average of 3.1 sessions per patient. The rate of subsequent full hospitalization was 12.5%. Main complications included electrolyte disorders (5%), non-catheter-related infections (7.5%), and acute kidney injury (7.5%). Following day hospital management, 22.5% of patients were enrolled in a geriatric frailty day hospital program, 32.5% in an intravenous iron day hospital, and 22.5% in a remote monitoring program. This diuretic day hospital model, integrated into a structured geriatric care pathway, appears feasible, safe, and relevant for managing very elderly patients with acute heart failure. It may represent an effective alternative to conventional hospitalization.

[PMID: 40923583] Management of diabetes mellitus in hemodialysis is highly complex due to increased glycemic variability and hypoglycemic risk. The use of technologies applied to diabetes has been shown to improve glycemic control, however data in dialysis patients are limited. <b>Purpose.</b> To describe the efficacy and safety of the minimed 780G AHCL system in a stable hemodialysis patient and during hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). <b>Case.</b> A 47-year-old patient with chronic transplant rejection complicated by post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTD) and chronic ischemic heart disease. He is undergoing MDI multi-injection insulin therapy with reduced compliance and the need for therapeutic adjustments in relation to hypoglycemia and daily and intradialytic glycemic variability. The use of an advanced integrated CGM+insulin pump system (AHCL) was indicated. Three-month data showed the achievement of therapeutic objectives for frail patients with comorbidities; they were also confirmed in a subsequent ICU admission for an episode of pneumonia and respiratory failure. The basal insulin requirement was adjusted automatically by the PID algorithm with daily adaptation of the insulin dose, even during hemodialysis sessions. <b>Conclusions.</b> The use of the AHCL system has proven to be safe, effective and flexible in achieving metabolic compensation both during dialysis and in interdialysis periods and also during a severe acute episode, with excellent control of glycemic values ​​during the same.

JMJD6 slows the hydroxylation of C-terminal lysine,JMJD6 AND hydroxylation AND C-terminal lysine AND protein hydroxylation,"22189873,41187378,41187075,41186441,41186318,41186277,41186213,41185331,41185290,41185004","[PMID: 22189873] Jumonji C-terminal (JmjC) domain-containing proteins are protein hydroxylases and histone demethylases that control gene expression. Jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (Jmjd6) is indispensable for embryonic development and has both histone arginine demethylase and lysyl-hydroxylase activities. The protein undergoes post-translational homo-oligomerization, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we examined the enzymatic activity of Jmjd6 and uncovered the mechanism underlying its homo-oligomerization. An in vitro enzymatic assay monitored by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry indicates that Jmjd6 is unable to remove the methyl group from histone arginine residues but can hydroxylate the histone H4 tail at lysine residues in a 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)- and Fe (II)-dependent manner. A mutational analysis reveals that the homo-oligomerization of Jmjd6 requires its enzymatic activity and the N- and C-termini. Using an in vitro enzymatic assay, we further demonstrate that Jmjd6 can hydroxylate its N-terminus but not its C-terminus. In summary, we did not detect arginine demethylase activity for Jmjd6, but we did confirm that it could catalyze the lysyl-hydroxylation of histone peptides. In addition, we demonstrated that the homo-oligomerization of Jmjd6 requires its own enzymatic activity and the N- and C-termini. We propose that Jmjd6 forms intermolecular covalent bonds between its N- and C-termini via autohydroxylation.

[PMID: 41187378] The high moisture content and perishability of the mulberry fruit restrict its high-value utilization. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) were extracted from mulberries using ultrasound-assisted acid, alkali, and enzymatic extraction processes. The structural and functional characteristics were systematically analyzed. The highest yield of SDF (23.61 %) obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction. Structural analysis showed that both IDF and SDF had a loose and porous structure with several exposed functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Functional experiments showed that IDF exhibited superior cholesterol- and nitrite-adsorption capacities compared with SDF. IDF and SDF obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities for glucose, cholesterol, and nitrite. In conclusion, ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction simultaneously enhances both the yield and functional properties of dietary fiber extracted from mulberry, providing an effective strategy for developing high-value functional ingredients and promoting sustainable utilization of the fruit.

[PMID: 41187075] RNA molecules play central roles in the assembly and regulation of biomolecular condensates, often in concert with proteins containing low complexity RNA-binding domains. Recently, it has been shown that RNA can phase-separate in the absence of any proteins. Unlike protein-based condensates, RNAs condensates are strongly influenced by magnesium ions which play crucial roles in their dynamics and thermodynamics, giving rise to base-specific lower critical solution temperatures (LCSTs). The molecular basis and functional significance of sequence and ion-dependent LCST behavior RNA condensates have yet to be elucidated. Here, we use atomistic simulations to systematically dissect the driving forces underlying the sequence-, ion-, and temperature-dependent phase behaviors of RNA condensates. By choosing RNA tetranucleotides alongside their ssDNA counterpart and chemically modified analogs, we map equilibrium thermodynamic profiles and structural ensembles across various external conditions. Our results show that magnesium ions promote LCST behavior by inducing local disorder-order transitions within RNA structures. Additionally, the base chemistry and the 2'hydroxyl group of the ribose sugar further modulate this LCST response. In agreement with experiments, we find that the thermal stability of RNA condensates follows the order G<sub>n</sub> > A<sub>n</sub> > C<sub>n</sub> > U<sub>n</sub>, governed by the balance of base stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. Moreover, our simulations reveal that posttranslational nucleotide modifications can fine-tune the threshold of RNA self-assembly and the resulting condensate structures.

[PMID: 41186441] A phytochemical investigation of <i>Punica granatum</i> L. stems and pericarpium yielded five new polyphenols (punicagranols A-E) and 47 known compounds. Antioxidant activity evaluated by DPPH assay indicated that compounds <b>13</b> and <b>25</b>-<b>33</b> exhibited strong radical-scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub> < 5 μM), outperforming ascorbic acid. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis linked this activity to hydroxyl group distribution and the presence of hexahydroxydiphenoyl and galloyl moieties. Compounds were also tested for inhibition of α-glucosidase and PTP1B, enzymes involved in type 2 diabetes. Notably, compounds <b>25</b>, <b>29</b>, and <b>33</b> exhibited potent dual inhibition, exceeding reference inhibitors. Kinetic and docking studies revealed that compound <b>25</b> acts as a competitive inhibitor, while compounds <b>29</b> and <b>33</b> inhibit PTP1B noncompetitively. SAR analysis further emphasized the importance of glucose core stereochemistry and galloyl substitution. These findings highlight ellagitannins as promising antidiabetic leads and support the use of <i>P. granatum</i> as a valuable source of health-promoting food.

[PMID: 41186277] Oxidative damage to RNA is associated with neurodegeneration, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer development. Studies that monitor RNA damage by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> often omit the physiological buffer bicarbonate in the reaction, which fails to account for the influence of the buffer on the iron-Fenton reaction. Herein, we monitored two in vitro systems to understand how bicarbonate redirects the iron-Fenton reaction from a hydroxyl radical (HO<sup>•</sup>) generator in the absence of bicarbonate to one that predominantly yields carbonate radical anion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup>) in the presence of this buffer. Using the HO<sup>•</sup>-selective fluorophore terephthalic acid, we found that the Fe(II)-ligand identity impacted the bicarbonate concentration required to transition the Fenton reaction to predominantly yield CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup>. These findings were then corroborated by following the oxidation of guanosine (rG), which reports on oxidation by both radicals, and uridine (rU) oxidation, which responds to only HO<sup>•</sup> as the oxidizing species. The studies found that as the Fe(II)-ligand complex stability increased, the bicarbonate concentration inflection point to favor CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup> production and rG oxidation also increased. Regardless of the ligand strength, the crossover values obtained were below physiologically relevant bicarbonate concentrations (<20 mM). Next, <i>Escherichia coli</i> or HEK293T cells were pre-equilibrated with bicarbonate from 0 to 20 mM before a bolus addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The bicarbonate-dependent inflection points for favoring CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup> over HO<sup>•</sup> (or ferryl) for <i>E. coli</i> (7.3 mM) and HEK293T (11.3 mM) cells differed, but were below physiologically relevant concentrations, supporting the hypothesis that the cellular iron-Fenton reaction normally yields CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup>. The redox-cycling compound menadione was used for continuous in-cell generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to find bicarbonate dependencies in oxidation reactions of RNA. The studies herein point toward the redirection of the iron-Fenton reaction in cells to predominantly yield CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•-</sup> that selectively damages rG sites in the transcriptome.

[PMID: 41186213] The environmental pollutant benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) can induce cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A (CYP1A) or generate metabolic products that disrupt the balance of oxidative stress, triggering inflammatory responses in the lungs and leading to tissue damage. Flavonoids, known for their natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, are potential targets for intervention. This study used phenacetin, a specific substrate probe for CYP1A, to evaluate the inhibitory effects of 40 flavonoids on CYP1A. Structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that introducing hydroxyl groups at positions 3- and 6-enhances CYP1A inhibition. Notably, 3,6-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) emerged as a significant inhibitor of CYP1A. In vitro experiments confirmed that DHF effectively inhibits BaP-induced cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1) in airway epithelial cells and shows dose-dependent inhibition of intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In summary, DHF is a promising CYP1A inhibitor and a potential anti-inflammatory candidate for preventing and treating CYP1A-mediated lung diseases.

[PMID: 41185331] This study investigated the impacts of gallic acid (GA) on the structural and functional properties of Rana chensinensis ovum protein isolate (RCOPI)-gellan gum (GG) Pickering emulsion gels. An innovative Pickering emulsion gel system (RGAGG-eg) was successfully developed. Mechanistic studies revealed that GA may act as a molecular bridge, utilizing its own phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups to enhance the interaction of RCOPI-GG through hydrogen bonding. This resulted in a 21.23 % reduction in the particle size of the RGAGG-cx, indicating that a denser crosslinked network was obtained. The particle size of the RGAGG-em droplets is reduced by 32.39 % as a result of the more closely bound complex particles being more securely adsorbed on the surface of the oil droplets. The helical change of the GG structure caused the emulsion to gel during the heating phase. CLSM and SEM confirmed GA-induced microstructural compaction, while rheological analysis demonstrated improved gel strength (G' > G''). The RGAGG-eg met IDDSI levels 4 pureed properties ideal for dysphagia management. As a proof-of-concept, the system achieved 98.26 % β-carotene encapsulation efficiency with 69.81 % bioaccessibility. Those results suggested the RGAGG-eg demonstrated dual functionality as a nutrient carrier and texture-modified food.

[PMID: 41185290] As consumer demand for functional dairy products continues to rise, there is growing interest in formulations that provide both nutritional value and added health benefits. In this study, a novel supramolecular hybrid hydrogel was developed from phlorizin (PHL) and diosmetin (DIO), two natural bioactive flavonoids, to enhance the texture and antioxidant properties of dairy products. The hydrogel was formed via co-assembly through non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking. Optimized at a 1:2 PHL:DIO molar ratio and 2 % concentration, the hydrogel exhibited improved solubility, thermal stability, and mechanical strength, with a storage modulus exceeding 2.8 kPa, pronounced shear-thinning behavior (viscosity 976,000 to 330 mPa·s at 0.1-10 s<sup>-1</sup>), and rapid self-healing (103 % recovery). In vitro antioxidant assessments showed significantly enhanced activity compared to individual flavonoids, including 74.43 % DPPH, 57.65 % hydroxyl radical, 80 % ABTS, and 94.92 % superoxide anion scavenging. In vivo experiments using Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated improved locomotion, a 28.6 % extension in lifespan under oxidative stress, and a 9-fold reduction in ROS levels. When applied in dairy systems, the hydrogel increased milk viscosity by 230-fold at low shear (0.5 % w/v) and improved yogurt texture, achieving 98.89 % water-holding capacity while promoting beneficial Lactobacillus growth. These findings highlight the potential of this dual-function hydrogel as a natural, multifunctional additive for enhancing both the sensory quality and health value of dairy products.

[PMID: 41185004] Edible polymeric composite hydrogel films offer a promising solution for cultured meat production. These films are made by incorporating natural polysaccharides, synthetic biocompatible polymers, and antioxidants within the scaffolds. This approach can help combat global climate change and meet the increasing demand for sustainable food sources. The utilization of edible polysaccharides in the fabrication of hydrogels is a cost-effective and sustainable approach, which serves as effective scaffolding in the cultivation of meat. The polymeric composite hydrogel films, designated as ""CSCP"" (curcumin-starch-carrageenan-PVA) with varying concentrations of polymers, consist of curcumin (an antioxidant and coloring agent), starch (potato), kappa (κ)-carrageenan, and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), with PVA being classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food applications. These edible polymeric composite hydrogel films were prepared with glycerol, serving as a plasticizer, and succinic acid, a crosslinker, through solvent casting and thermal treatment methods. Analytical techniques, including field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and tensile strength testing, were employed to evaluate the morphology, crystalline nature, composition, and mechanical properties of the fabricated CSCP scaffolds. The incorporation of glycerol and succinic acid facilitates the plasticizing and cross-linking of the polymeric materials via hydroxyl and carboxyl group interactions during film formation. Increasing the potato starch content in the CSCP-2 composite hydrogel film reduced its mechanical strength. This is because the starch disrupted the polymer's crystalline regions. The resulting amorphous structure improved the film's flexibility and elasticity. Nevertheless, the increased potato starch content adversely affects interfacial adhesion, reducing tensile strength. The swelling ratio of the CSCP-2 composite hydrogel film slightly decreases with higher potato starch content, which limits hydrogen bonding interactions with water. Notably, the CSCP composite hydrogel films support adhesion and proliferation of bovine muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) with good cytocompatibility for up to 21 days. However, a slight decrease in metabolic activity on CSCP-2 films was observed. This was likely due to nutrient depletion and limited oxygen diffusion caused by cell multilayering. Overall, the starch-based edible CSCP composite hydrogel films exhibit significant potential as scaffolds for culturing bovine muscle satellite cells (myosatellite cells), paving the way for large-scale production of three-dimensional (3D) cultured meat.",10
Klf4 is not required for proper myeloid cell differentiation.,Klf4 AND myeloid cell differentiation AND Klf4 knockout AND differentiation independent,"31137011,27464507,41187216,41186644,41186354,41186155,41185886,41185854,41185627,41185342","[PMID: 31137011] Obesity is strongly associated with chronic inflammation for which adipose tissue macrophages play a critical role. The objective of this study is to identify monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) as a key player governing M1-M2 macrophage polarization and energy balance. We evaluated body weight, fat mass, adipocyte size and energy expenditure as well as core body temperature of Ccl2 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. Adipose tissues, differentiated adipocyte and bone marrow-derived macrophages were assessed by qPCR, Western blot analysis and histochemistry. MCP-1 deficiency augmented energy expenditure by promoting browning in white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue activity via increasing the expressions of Ucp1, Prdm16, Tnfrsf9, Ppargc1a, Nrf1 and Th and mitochondrial DNA copy number. MCP-1 abrogation promoted M2 polarization which is characterized by increased expression of Arg1, Chil3, Il10 and Klf4 whereas it decreased M1 polarization by decreased p65 nuclear translocation and attenuated expression of Itgax, Tnf and Nos2, leading to increased browning of adipocytes. Enhanced M2 polarization and attenuated M1 polarization in the absence of MCP-1 are independent. Collectively, our results suggest that the action of MCP-1 in macrophages modulates energy expenditure by impairing browning in adipose tissue.

[PMID: 27464507] Diet-induced obesity causes chronic macrophage-driven inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) leading to insulin resistance. WAT macrophages, however, differ in their origin, gene expression and activities: unlike infiltrating monocyte-derived inflammatory macrophages, WAT-resident macrophages counteract inflammation and insulin resistance, yet, the mechanisms underlying their transcriptional programming remain poorly understood. We recently reported that a nuclear receptor cofactor-glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting protein (GRIP)1-cooperates with GR to repress inflammatory genes. Here, we show that GRIP1 facilitates macrophage programming in response to IL4 via a GR-independent pathway by serving as a coactivator for Kruppel-like factor (KLF)4-a driver of tissue-resident macrophage differentiation. Moreover, obese mice conditionally lacking GRIP1 in macrophages develop massive macrophage infiltration and inflammation in metabolic tissues, fatty livers, hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance recapitulating metabolic disease. Thus, GRIP1 is a critical regulator of immunometabolism, which engages distinct transcriptional mechanisms to coordinate the balance between macrophage populations and ultimately promote metabolic homeostasis.

[PMID: 41187216] Many taxa have independently evolved genetic sex determination where a single gene located on a sex chromosome controls gonadal differentiation. The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex-reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the ""Four Core Genotypes"" model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.

[PMID: 41186644] The optimal management of T1b gastric cancer (GC) remains controversial, largely due to the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM). This study aimed to clarify the anatomical distribution of LNM and develop a predictive nomogram for patients with T1b GC. Clinical and pathological data from 1041 patients with pathologically confirmed T1b GC who underwent D2 gastrectomy at a single high-volume center in China were retrospectively analyzed. The frequency and distribution of LNM, including skip metastases, were assessed. Predictive factors identified by logistic regression were incorporated into a nomogram, which was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration plots. The overall incidence of LNM was 28.34%, with first- and second-tier rates of 25.4% and 10.3%, respectively. LNM occurred across almost all nodal stations without a consistent anatomical pattern. Lymph node skip metastasis was detected in 2.98% of patients, with no reliable predictors. Importantly, no LNM was observed in well-differentiated tumors ≤ 3 cm, and in moderately to well-differentiated tumors of this size, metastases were confined to first-tier nodes. Multivariable analysis identified female, younger age, larger tumor size, horizontal location, poor differentiation, signet ring cell component, and lymphovascular invasion as independent predictors. The nomogram incorporating these factors demonstrated good discrimination (AUC 0.83; 95% CI 0.80-0.86) and favorable calibration and clinical utility. LNM in T1b GC shows a heterogeneous distribution and cannot be predicted by anatomical site alone. Sentinel lymph node biopsy with limited resection may be feasible for carefully selected patients with ≤ 3 cm, moderately to well-differentiated tumors, while D2 gastrectomy remains standard for others. The proposed nomogram may facilitate individualized surgical decision-making but requires external validation.

[PMID: 41186354] Myeloma overexpressed gene (MYEOV) was initially identified as a gene amplified in several malignancies and was found to promote cell proliferation and metastasis. Our previous comparative RNA sequencing and epigenetic analyses revealed high MYEOV levels in differentiated corneal epithelial cells and showed that TET2 epigenetically regulated MYEOV expression. In the current study, we aimed to further characterize the expression and regulation of MYEOV in the human ocular surface. MYEOV expression was examined by immunostaining of the human corneas and by analysis of the publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data. Gene knockdown (KD) of MYEOV and the regulators of corneal epithelial differentiation, PAX6 and KLF4, in in vitro-expanded corneal epithelial cells was performed using siRNA transfection. Protein expression levels were examined by western blot. MYEOV KD cells were subjected to colony-forming and EdU cell proliferation assays and RNA sequencing analysis. Human cornea immunostaining revealed strong MYEOV expression in the KRT12-positive differentiated corneal epithelial cells, whereas the majority of KRT13-positive differentiated conjunctival epithelial cells were MYEOV negative. MYEOV expression was not detected in the other surface ectoderm-derived epithelia, such as skin and oral mucosa. Both PAX6 KD and KLF4 KD resulted in a reduction of MYEOV and KRT12 protein expression. MYEOV KD decreased cell proliferation. Our study revealed specific high MYEOV expression in KRT12-positive corneal epithelial cells among surface ectoderm-derived epithelia. Similar to KRT12, MYEOV expression is regulated by PAX6 and KLF4. Functionally, MYEOV regulates the proliferation of transient amplifying cells in the cornea.

[PMID: 41186155] Molecular chaperones play a critical role in proteostasis by aiding the folding of newly synthesized proteins and the refolding of misfolded proteins. Cells must match the protein synthesis rate to the protein folding capacity to avoid the accumulation of unfolded proteins that can form toxic aggregates. The Hsp70 chaperone DnaK binds to ribosomes and decreases protein synthesis in the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium when facing cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation, an infection-relevant stress that disrupts proteostasis. DnaK decreases protein synthesis independently of J-domain cochaperones and nucleotide exchange factor GrpE even though J-domain cochaperones and GrpE are required for DnaK's canonical role in protein folding and refolding. DnaK's activity contrasts with that exhibited by the bacteria-specific chaperone trigger factor, which associates with ribosomes and carries out cotranslational protein folding in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-abundant conditions. Under infection-relevant conditions, the master regulator of S. typhimurium virulence and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis PhoP promotes the expression of DnaK, but not of J-domain cochaperones, GrpE, or trigger factor, suggesting that the differential expression of chaperones and cochaperones furthers S. typhimurium pathogenesis. Hsp70 chaperones also associate with ribosomes in eukaryotic cells but instead promote protein synthesis, the opposite effect that DnaK binding to ribosomes has in bacteria. Thus, Hsp70 chaperone activity differs across growth conditions and among organisms.

[PMID: 41185886] The activation of dendritic cells, which is atypical, is vital for triggering the acquired immune response in people afflicted with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This research seeks to pinpoint significant genes linked to dendritic cells within the lung tissues of COPD patients by utilizing bioinformatics predictions and experimental validation. Differentially expressed genes of classical dendritic cells (cDCs) were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from GSE196638, and their biological functions and regulatory signaling pathways were thoroughly explored. Additionally, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from GSE26296 was utilized to analyze differentially expressed genes in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) of emphysema patients. The RNA-seq data from GSE38974 underwent weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) along with differential analysis to pinpoint genes that are differentially expressed and modules linked to COPD. Validation was performed using a mouse model of emphysema induced by cigarette smoke (CS) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) exposed to 3% cigarette smoke extract (CSE). The genes that showed differential expression in cDCs and mDCs were mainly associated with immune responses, the reaction to interferon-gamma, the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells, along with the signaling pathways of TNF and IL-17. The WGCNA results revealed that the green-yellow and red modules exhibited the highest correlation coefficients with the COPD phenotype. An assessment of the genes that are expressed differently between cDCs and mDCs, combined with the intersection of GSE38974 module genes and differentially expressed genes, results in the identification of four dendritic cells (DCs)-related genes: one upregulated signature gene (RASGRP3) and three downregulated signature genes (C1QB, BLOC1S2, VSIG4). In both the lung tissues of mice with CS-induced emphysema and in CSE-treated BMDCs, RT-qPCR validated the expression trends of these four genes. Concomitantly, Western blot revealed a reduction in VSIG4 protein level in the lung tissues of emphysema mice compared with the control group. RASGRP3, C1QB, BLOC1S2, and VSIG4 may represent DCs-related genes in the lung tissue of COPD patients, potentially involved in the development and progression of emphysema.

[PMID: 41185854] To evaluate the diagnostic value of serum hepatokines, leucocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), for pediatric metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and to assess their correlations with metabolic/liver injury indices and diagnostic utility. A total of 198 patients were included in the study (78 in the MAFLD group, 60 in the obese non-MAFLD and 60 in the control group). Serum LECT2 and PEDF levels were measured in all three groups. Group comparisons were performed, and LECT2/PEDF levels were correlated with metabolic parameters, and liver injury markers. ROC curve analyses and logistic regression were also conducted. Serum LECT2 and PEDF levels exhibited stepwise elevations (control < obese non-MAFLD < MAFLD; both <i>P</i> < 0.001), with significant correlations in MAFLD patients to BMI, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and liver injury markers (ALT/AST). For MAFLD versus controls, PEDF showed superior diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.804, 95% CI: 0.731-0.877) to LECT2 (AUC = 0.734, 0.651-0.817), while combined PEDF with LECT2 further improved discrimination (AUC = 0.849; sensitivity 79.5%, specificity 78.3%). For MAFLD versus obese non-MAFLD, both hepatokines had modest utility (LECT2 AUC = 0.623; PEDF AUC = 0.668), though their combination enhanced performance (AUC = 0.712; sensitivity 60.3%, specificity 73.9%). Multivariable analysis confirmed LECT2 and PEDF as independent MAFLD predictors. LECT2 and PEDF are elevated in pediatric MAFLD and correlate with metabolic dysfunction. While their combination effectively distinguishes MAFLD from healthy controls, it shows moderate efficacy in differentiating MAFLD from simple obesity. Nevertheless, the LECT2/PEDF panel represents a promising risk-stratification tool to identify high-risk obese children for further diagnostic evaluation.

[PMID: 41185627] Despite the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target immunosuppressive interactions, treatment resistance remains a major clinical challenge. The tumor microenvironment is comprised of tumor, immune, and stromal cell types that communicate through secreted and cell surface proteins. This can be represented by a weighted, directed network where pairs of cell types communicate via multiple ligand-receptor interactions with varying strengths. Identifying interaction network motifs that are linked with outcome or evolve pre- to post-ICI presents a rational framework to identify combination therapeutic targets. Interaction inference was performed on publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing data from melanoma patients. The constructed patient-specific networks were input to multivariate statistical learning approaches to identify network motifs that predicted response pre-treatment and that shifted pre- to post-treatment. Relevance of interactions was validated by (1) differential expression of related pathways in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, (2) survival associations in an independent bulk RNA-seq dataset, and (3) repeated analyses of scRNA-seq data in a second cohort. Immune-immune interactions with roles in T cell activation, chemotaxis, and adhesion were upregulated in patients who respond to therapy pre-treatment. Related pathways were perturbed in involved immune cells and expression of these genes was associated with improved survival. The interactome also distinguished pre- and post-treatment biopsies with high accuracy despite no significant differences in individual interactions. Analysis in the validation dataset with mixed responses pre-treatment recapitulated results from the discovery analyses. Unbiased analysis of interaction networks and their evolution is a powerful framework to guide prognostic indicators and novel combination targets to improve patient outcomes. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12195-025-00857-y.

[PMID: 41185342] This study demonstrates the use of solvent mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy with a MIRA analyzer, combined with modern machine learning/chemometric techniques for saffron quality and authenticity control. A total of 111 authentic saffron samples from six distinct geographical regions in Iran were analyzed. Saffron metabolite extraction was conducted using a modified solvent extraction protocol based on ISO 3632 standard, screened and optimized through design of experiments (DOE). The study focused on two main objectives: geographical origin discrimination and adulteration detection. For exploratory data analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used for geographical origin discrimination, achieving a 93.0 % accuracy in the test set, with the first derivative as one important preprocessing step. However, a higher accuracy of 95.5 % was obtained using random subspace discriminant ensemble (RSDE) without the need for preprocessing the MIR data. In the next phase, the detection of four common plant-based saffron adulterants, including safflower, marigold, rubia and even saffron style was carried out using the MIRA analyzer. Data-driven soft independent modeling of class analogy (DD-SIMCA) successfully differentiated between authentic and adulterated samples, achieving 100 % sensitivity and specificity. PLS-DA and RSDE were then employed to identify the type and level of adulterants, with RSDE clearly outperforming PLS-DA, achieving accuracy above 94.0 %, as compared to PLS-DA's accuracy of over 90.0 %. In conclusion, the combination of solvent-based MIR spectroscopy and modern chemometric techniques shows great potential as a reliable tool for saffron quality control at the point of need.",10

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hormone mainly produced by the liver, improves metabolism and extends lifespan. To explore its effects without developmental confounders, we generated mice with adipocyte-specific FGF21 overexpression beginning in adulthood. When fed a high-fat diet, these mice lived up to 3.3 years, resisted weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, and showed reduced liver steatosis. Aged transgenic mice also displayed lower levels of inflammatory immune cells and lipotoxic ceramides in visceral adipose tissue, benefits that occurred even in the absence of adiponectin, a hormone known to regulate ceramide breakdown. These results suggest that fat tissue is a central site for FGF21's beneficial effects and point to its potential for treating metabolic syndrome and age-related diseases by promoting a healthier metabolic profile under dietary stress and extending healthspan and lifespan.

[PMID: 39972173] Consequences of age-associated thymic atrophy include declining T-cell responsiveness to pathogens and vaccines and diminished T-cell self-tolerance. Cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) are primary targets of thymic aging, and recent studies suggested that their maintenance requires mTOR signaling downstream of medullary TEC (mTEC)-derived growth factors. Here, to test this hypothesis, we generated a knock-in mouse model in which FGF21 and mCherry are expressed by most mTECs. We find that mTEC-derived FGF21 promotes temporally distinct patterns of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in cTECs, promotes thymus and individual cTEC growth and maintenance, increases T-cell responsiveness to viral infection, and diminishes indicators of peripheral autoimmunity in older mice. The effects of FGF21 overexpression on thymus size and mTOR signaling were abrogated by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These results reveal a mechanism by which paracrine FGF21 signaling regulates thymus size and function throughout the lifespan, as well as potential therapeutic targets for improving T-cell function and tolerance in aging.

[PMID: 39972172] Age-related thymic involution precedes aging of all other organs in vertebrates and initiates the process of declining T cell diversity, which leads to eventual immune dysfunction. Whether FGF21, a liver-derived pro-longevity hormone that is also produced in thymic stroma, including by adipocytes, controls the mechanism of thymic demise is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that elevation of FGF21 in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and in adipocytes protects against thymic aging, whereas conditional hepatic overexpression did not impact thymic biology in aged mice. Notably, elevation of thymic FGF21 increased naïve CD8 T cells in aged animals and extended healthspan. Mechanistically, thymic FGF21 overexpression elevated TECs and reduced fibroadipogenic cells. Ablation of β-klotho, the obligatory co-receptor for FGF21 in Foxn1<sup>+</sup> TECs, accelerated thymic aging, suggesting regulation of TECs by FGF21 is partially required for thymic lymphopoiesis. These findings establish that paracrine FGF21 improves thymic function and delays immune aging.

[PMID: 39947331] Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a serious chronic liver disease for which therapeutic options are limited. Although fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) analogs have shown therapeutic promise for MASH in multiple preclinical and clinical studies, their underlying mechanisms of action remain elusive. Liver-specific PPP6C and βKlotho knockout mice and their wild-type littermates were fed an AMLN (Amylin liver NASH) diet for 16 weeks or a CDA-HFD (choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet) for 8 weeks, followed by daily subcutaneous injection of recombinant FGF21 (0.5 mg/kg) or vehicle for 4 weeks. A mass spectrometry assay identified PPP6C as a βKlotho-binding protein. An in vitro phosphatase assay was used to evaluate the effects of FGF21 on PPP6C activity. PPP6C expression was also analyzed in human samples from patients with MASH. We identified serine and threonine phosphatase PPP6C as a direct target of FGF21. Hepatic PPP6C deficiency accelerates MASH progression in mice fed an AMLN diet or CDA-HFD, which blocks the effect of FGF21 on MASH. Mechanistically, PPP6C is sufficient to interact with the coreceptor βKlotho upon FGF21 treatment and directly dephosphorylates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) at Ser939 and Thr1462, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 and promoting nuclear entry of TFE3 and Lipin1. In the livers of patients with MASH, expression levels of PPP6C are decreased whereas TSC2 phosphorylation is elevated. PPP6C acts as a fundamental downstream mediator essential for FGF21 signaling in hepatocytes and targeting PPP6C by FGF21 may offer therapeutic potential for treating MASH in humans. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a severe chronic liver disease that increases susceptibility to more severe cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Effective therapeutic strategies for MASH remain an unmet need. Herein, we have identified serine and threonine protein phosphatase PPP6C as a negative regulator of MASH progression in mice and humans. PPP6C activity is increased by FGF21 via an autocrine effect mediated by FGFRs/βKlotho in hepatocytes. Pharmacological administration of FGF21 protects against MASH pathology at least in large through the interaction between βKlotho and PPP6C and PPP6C-mediated dephosphorylation of TSC2 in hepatocytes. This study implies that pharmacological approaches targeting PPP6C activity may offer attractive prospects for treating liver fibrosis and MASH.

[PMID: 39567986] Dietary restriction (DR) has multiple beneficial effects on health and longevity and can also improve the efficacy of certain therapies. Diets used to instigate DR are diverse and the corresponding response is not uniformly measured. We compared the systemic and liver-specific transcriptional response to intermittent fasting (IF) and commercially available fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) after short- and long-term use in C57BL/6 J mice. We show that neither DR regimen causes observable adverse effects in mice. The weight loss was limited to 20% and was quickly compensated during refeeding days. The slightly higher weight loss upon FMD versus IF correlated with stronger fasting response assessed by lower glucose levels and higher ketone body, free fatty acids and especially FGF21 concentrations in blood. RNA sequencing demonstrated similar transcriptional programs in the liver after both regimens, with PPARα signalling as top enriched pathway, while on individual gene level FMD more potently increased gluconeogenesis-related, and PPARα and p53 target gene expression compared to IF. Repeated IF induced similar transcriptional responses as acute IF. However, repeated cycles of FMD resulted in blunted expression of genes involved in ketogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Short-term FMD causes more pronounced changes in blood parameters and slightly higher weight loss than IF, while both activate similar pathways (particularly PPARα signalling) in the liver. On individual gene level FMD induces a stronger transcriptional response, whereas cyclic application blunts transcriptional upregulation of fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis only in FMD. Hence, our comparative characterization of IF and FMD protocols renders both as effective DR regimens and serves as resource in the fasting research field.

[PMID: 38943639] Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. A model cell system is constructed to induce ferroptosis by re-expressing the transcription factor BACH1, a potent ferroptosis inducer, in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs). The transfer of the culture supernatant from ferroptotic iMEFs activates the proliferation of hepatoma cells and other fibroblasts and suppresses cellular senescence-like features. The BACH1-dependent secretion of the longevity factor FGF21 is increased in ferroptotic iMEFs. The anti-senescent effects of the culture supernatant from these iMEFs are abrogated by Fgf21 knockout. BACH1 activates the transcription of Fgf21 by promoting ferroptotic stress and increases FGF21 protein expression by suppressing its autophagic degradation through transcriptional Sqstm1 and Lamp2 repression. The BACH1-induced ferroptotic FGF21 secretion suppresses obesity in high-fat diet-fed mice and the short lifespan of progeria mice. The inhibition of these aging-related phenotypes can be physiologically significant regarding ferroptosis.

[PMID: 38664021] Mitochondrial transcription factor A, TFAM, is essential for mitochondrial function. We examined the effects of overexpressing the <i>TFAM</i> gene in mice. Two types of transgenic mice were created: <i>TFAM</i> heterozygous (<i>TFAM</i> Tg) and homozygous (<i>TFAM</i> Tg/Tg) mice. <i>TFAM</i> Tg/Tg mice were smaller and leaner notably with longer lifespans. In skeletal muscle, TFAM overexpression changed gene and protein expression in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, with down-regulation in complexes 1, 3, and 4 and up-regulation in complexes 2 and 5. The iMPAQT analysis combined with metabolomics was able to clearly separate the metabolomic features of the three types of mice, with increased degradation of fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids and decreased glycolysis in homozygotes. Consistent with these observations, comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed signs of mitochondrial stress, with elevation of genes associated with the integrated and mitochondrial stress responses, including Atf4, Fgf21, and Gdf15. These found that mitohormesis develops and metabolic shifts in skeletal muscle occur as an adaptive strategy.

[PMID: 38653921] Aging is a physiological condition accomplished with persistent low-grade inflammation and metabolic disorders. FGF21 has been reported to act as a potent longevity determinant, involving inflammatory response and energy metabolism. In this study, we engineered aging FGF21 knockout mice of 36-40 weeks and observed that FGF21 deficiency manifests a spontaneous inflammatory response of lung and abnormal accumulation of lipids in liver. On one hand, inflamed state in lungs and increased circulating inflammatory cytokines were found in FGF21 knockout mice of 36-40 weeks. To evaluate the ability of FGF21 to suppress inflammation, a subsequent study found that FGF21 knockout aggravated LPS-induced pulmonary exudation and inflammatory infiltration in mice, while exogenous administration of FGF21 reversed these malignant phenotypes by enhancing microvascular endothelial junction. On the other hand, FGF21 knockout induces fatty liver in aging mice, characterized by excessive accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. Further quantitative metabolomics and lipidomics analysis revealed perturbed metabolic profile in liver lacking FGF21, including disrupted glucose and lipids metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Taken together, this investigation reveals the protective role of FGF21 during aging by weakening the inflammatory response and balancing energy metabolism.

[PMID: 37935033] Partial leptin reduction can induce significant weight loss, while weight loss contributes to partial leptin reduction. The cause-and-effect relationship between leptin reduction and weight loss remains to be further elucidated. Here, we show that FGF21 and the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide rapidly induced a reduction in leptin. This leptin reduction contributed to the beneficial effects of GLP-1R agonism in metabolic health, as transgenically maintaining leptin levels during treatment partially curtailed the beneficial effects seen with these agonists. Moreover, a higher degree of leptin reduction during treatment, induced by including a leptin neutralizing antibody with either FGF21 or liraglutide, synergistically induced greater weight loss and better glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice. Furthermore, upon cessation of either liraglutide or FGF21 treatment, the expected immediate weight regain was observed, associated with a rapid increase in circulating leptin levels. Prevention of this leptin surge with leptin neutralizing antibodies slowed down weight gain and preserved better glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, a significant reduction in leptin induced a higher degree of leptin sensitivity in hypothalamic neurons. Our observations support a model that postulates that a reduction of leptin levels is a necessary prerequisite for substantial weight loss, and partial leptin reduction is a viable strategy to treat obesity and its associated insulin resistance.

[PMID: 37699965] Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has been developed as a potential therapeutic agent for metabolic syndromes. Moreover, FGF21 is considered a pro-longevity hormone because transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21 display extended lifespan, raising the possibility of using FGF21 to promote healthy aging. We recently showed that visceral fat directed FGF21 gene therapy improves metabolic and immune health in insulin resistant BTBR mice. Here, we used a fat directed rAAV-FGF21 vector in 17-month-old female mice to investigate whether long-term FGF21 gene transfer could mitigate aging-related functional decline. Animals with FGF21 treatment displayed a steady, significant lower body weight over 7-month of the study compared to age-matched control mice. FGF21 treatment reduced adiposity and increased relative lean mass and energy expenditure associated with almost 100 folds higher serum level of FGF21. However, those changes were not translated into benefits on muscle function and did not affect metabolic function of liver. Overall, we have demonstrated that a single dose of fat-directed AAV-FGF21 treatment can provide a sustainable, high serum level of FGF21 over long period of time, and mostly influences adipose tissue homeostasis and energy expenditure. High levels of FGF21 alone in aged mice is not sufficient to improve liver or muscle functions.",10

The hormone is crucial for regulation of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and energy balance. Compared with natural FGF21, FGF21 analogs have become drug candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases owing to their long half-life and greater stability <i>in vitro</i>. Apolipoprotein E (<i>Apoe)</i>-knockout (<i>Apoe</i> <sup>-/-</sup>) mice exhibit progressive disruptions in lipid metabolism <i>in vivo</i> and develop further atherosclerosis pathological features owing to <i>Apoe</i> deletion. Therefore, this study used an <i>Apoe</i> <sup>-/-</sup> mouse model to investigate the effects of a long-acting FGF21 analog (PF-05231023) on lipid metabolism and related parameters. Eighteen <i>Apoe</i> <sup>-/-</sup> female mice were fed a Western diet equivalent for 12 weeks, and then randomly assigned to intraperitoneally receive either physiological saline (the control group) or 10 mg/kg PF-05231023 (the treatment group) three times a week for seven consecutive weeks. Body composition, glucose tolerance, blood and liver cholesterol, triglyceride levels, liver vacuolization levels, peri-ovarian white adipocyte hypertrophy, aortic atherosclerotic plaque formation, and the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in adipose tissue were subsequently assessed before and after treatment. The aortic atherosclerotic plaque area was reduced in mice in the PF-05231023 treatment group compared with that in the saline group. Although the effect of PF-05231023 on the plasma biochemical indexes of mice was small, it significantly reduced lipid levels and lipid droplet accumulation in the liver, and reduced adipocyte hypertrophy in white adipose tissue. Transcriptome analysis of adipose tissue showed that PF-05231023 treatment downregulated the expression of lipid synthesis-related genes and inhibited the sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 gene, thereby improving lipid deposition. PF-05231023 effectively improved the lipid metabolism of <i>Apoe</i> <sup>-/-</sup> mice, demonstrating an anti-atherosclerotic effect and providing a scientific basis and experimental foundation for the clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases by using long-acting FGF21 analogs.

[PMID: 39108652] Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), an environmental toxicant and endocrine disruptor, has been shown to exacerbate atherosclerosis when combined with a high-fat diet. Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF21), a novel hormone with anti-atherosclerotic properties, is associated with the presence of atherosclerosis and reduces plaque formation in experimental animals. The present study aimed to investigate the chronic effect of BaP injection on hepatic FGF21 expression, as an anti-atherosclerotic hormone, in mice fed with or without an atherogenic diet (AtD). Eighteen C57BL/6J male mice (6 weeks) were randomly divided into six groups based on the dosage and diet. Blood samples were collected, and serum cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C, LDL-C, and glucose levels were measured. FGF21 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Atherosclerotic lesions in mice were studied with Oil Red O (ORO) staining. Benzo(a)pyrene causes a significant increase in liver FGF21 expression in a dose-dependent manner, and BaP co-exposure with AtD leads to a further increase in FGF21 expression. Additionally, the addition of BaP to AtD significantly increased the serum glucose, cholesterol, and LDL-C levels and accelerated the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Besides, our findings showed that there is a significant positive correlation between FGF21 expression and glucose, cholesterol, LDL-C, and ORO-positive areas. Our findings revealed that BaP increases the expression of endogenous FGF21 in treated animals as a compensatory response to protect the heart from atherosclerosis induced by BaP and AtD.

[PMID: 36006939] Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, is readily regulated by exercise, and it can inhibit NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-mediated pyroptosis. However, it is not clear whether aerobic exercise inhibits atherosclerosis via these pathways. Eight-week-old apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice on a high-fat diet were randomly divided into 1-h post-exercise (EX-1h), 24-h post-exercise (EX-24h), and sedentary (SED) groups. C57BL/6J wild-type mice fed normal chow served as controls (WT group). Mice in the EX-1h and EX-24h groups were subjected to treadmill exercise training for 12 weeks. Aerobic exercise reduced body weight; blood glucose, lipid, and inflammation levels; and aortic plaque area proportion. Aerobic exercise increased the sensitivity of FGF21 by upregulating the expression of the downstream receptor adiponectin (ApN); the serum FGF21 level after exercise increased initially, and then decreased. Aerobic exercise downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis-related markers in the aorta, and FGF21 may participate in the above process. Meanwhile, the liver may be the tissue source of serum FGF21 during aerobic exercise. In conclusion, aerobic exercise may inhibit atherogenesis by regulating FGF21 and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. Our study provides new information on the atherosclerosis-preventing mechanism of aerobic exercise.

[PMID: 33693480] Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, a key regulator of energy metabolism, is currently evaluated in humans for treatment of type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the effects of FGF21 on cardiovascular benefit, particularly on lipoprotein metabolism in relation to atherogenesis, remain elusive. Here, the role of FGF21 in lipoprotein metabolism in relation to atherosclerosis development was investigated by pharmacological administration of a half-life extended recombinant FGF21 protein to hypercholesterolaemic APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a well-established model mimicking atherosclerosis initiation and development in humans. FGF21 reduced plasma total cholesterol, explained by a reduction in non-HDL-cholesterol. Mechanistically, FGF21 promoted brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, thereby enhancing the selective uptake of fatty acids from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into BAT and into browned WAT, consequently accelerating the clearance of the cholesterol-enriched remnants by the liver. In addition, FGF21 reduced body fat, ameliorated glucose tolerance and markedly reduced hepatic steatosis, related to up-regulated hepatic expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and increased hepatic VLDL-triglyceride secretion. Ultimately, FGF21 largely decreased atherosclerotic lesion area, which was mainly explained by the reduction in non-HDL-cholesterol as shown by linear regression analysis, decreased lesion severity, and increased atherosclerotic plaque stability index. FGF21 improves hypercholesterolaemia by accelerating triglyceride-rich lipoprotein turnover as a result of activating BAT and browning of WAT, thereby reducing atherosclerotic lesion severity and increasing atherosclerotic lesion stability index. We have thus provided additional support for the clinical use of FGF21 in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

[PMID: 33677937] Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues regulate glucose homeostasis and have anti-inflammatory properties, but cause gastrointestinal side effects. The fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormonal regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism that has poor pharmacokinetic properties, including a short half-life. To overcome these limitations, we investigated the effect of a low-dose combination of a GLP-1 analogue and FGF21 on atherosclerosis-related molecular pathways. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 30 weeks followed by an atherogenic diet for 10 weeks and were divided into four groups: control (saline), liraglutide (0.3 mg/kg/day), FGF21 (5 mg/kg/day), and low-dose combination treatment with liraglutide (0.1 mg/kg/day) and FGF21 (2.5 mg/kg/day) (n=6/group) for 6 weeks. The effects of each treatment on various atherogenesisrelated pathways were assessed. Liraglutide, FGF21, and their low-dose combination significantly reduced atheromatous plaque in aorta, decreased weight, glucose, and leptin levels, and increased adiponectin levels. The combination treatment upregulated the hepatic uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) and Akt1 mRNAs compared with controls. Matric mentalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were downregulated and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) were upregulated in liver of the liraglutide-alone and combination-treatment groups. The combination therapy also significantly decreased the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Caspase-3 was increased, whereas MMP-9, ICAM-1, p-Akt, and p-ERK1/2 were downregulated in the liraglutide-alone and combination-treatment groups. Administration of a low-dose GLP-1 analogue and FGF21 combination exerts beneficial effects on critical pathways related to atherosclerosis, suggesting the synergism of the two compounds.

[PMID: 32957703] Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormonal regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism. We aimed to investigate the effect of an FGF21 analogue (LY2405319) on the development of atherosclerosis and its associated parameters. ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 14 weeks and were randomly assigned to control (saline) or FGF21 (0.1 mg/kg) treatment group (<i>n</i> = 10/group) for 5 weeks. Plaque size in the aortic arch/valve areas and cardiovascular risk markers were evaluated in blood and tissues. The effects of FGF21 on various atherogenesis-related pathways were also assessed. Atherosclerotic plaque areas in the aortic arch/valve were significantly smaller in the FGF21 group than in controls after treatment. FGF21 significantly decreased body weight and glucose concentrations, and increased circulating adiponectin levels. FGF21 treatment alleviated insulin resistance and decreased circulating concentrations of triglycerides, which were significantly correlated with plaque size. FGF21 treatment reduced lipid droplets in the liver and decreased fat cell size and inflammatory cell infiltration in the abdominal visceral fat compared with the control group. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels were decreased and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were increased by FGF21 treatment. Uncoupling protein 1 expression in subcutaneous fat was greater and fat cell size in brown fat was smaller in the FGF21 group compared with controls. Administration of FGF21 showed anti-atherosclerotic effects in atherosclerosis-prone mice and exerted beneficial effects on critical atherosclerosis pathways. Improvements in inflammation and insulin resistance seem to be mechanisms involved in the mitigation of atherosclerosis by FGF21 therapy.

[PMID: 32445748] Fibroblast growth factor 21(FGF21) is an endocrine cytokine that targets inflammation and atherosclerosis (AS). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the FGF21 anti-AS effect remain to be explored. Pyroptosis induced by hyperlipidemia or oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) is a significant step in the advancement of AS. This work aimed to evaluate the mechanisms and functioning of FGF21 against AS using an atherosclerotic animal model and oxLDL mimic in vitro. We found that exogenous treatments with FGF21 significantly reduced the aortic sinus plaque area and ameliorated dyslipidemia in apoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. FGF21 attenuated the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins both in vivo and in vitro. Possibly, FGF21 improves mitochondrial function, inhibits mitochondrial division, and reduces ROS production by maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and function to reduce NLRP3 related pyroptosis and inhibits VECs endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby exerting an anti-atherosclerotic effect.

[PMID: 32227589] Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) acts as an anti-atherosclerotic agent. However, the specific mechanisms governing this regulatory activity are unclear. Autophagy is a highly conserved cell stress response which regulates atherosclerosis (AS) by reducing lipid droplet degradation in foam cells. We sought to assess whether FGF21 could inhibit AS by regulating cholesterol metabolism in foam cells via autophagy and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without FGF21 and FGF21 + 3-Methyladenine (3MA) for 12 weeks. Our results showed that FGF21 inhibited AS in HFD-fed ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which was reversed by 3MA treatment. Moreover, FGF21 increased plaque RACK1 and autophagy-related protein (LC3 and beclin-1) expression in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, thus preventing AS. However, these proteins were inhibited by LV-RACK1 shRNA injection. Foam cell development is a crucial determinant of AS, and cholesterol efflux from foam cells represents an important defensive measure of AS. In this study, foam cells were treated with FGF21 for 24 hours after a pre-treatment with 3MA, ATG5 siRNA or RACK1 siRNA. Our results indicated that FGF21-induced autophagy promoted cholesterol efflux to reduce cholesterol accumulation in foam cells by up-regulating RACK1 expression. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation results showed that RACK1 was able to activate AMPK and interact with ATG5. Taken together, our results indicated that FGF21 induces autophagy to promote cholesterol efflux and reduce cholesterol accumulation in foam cells through RACK1-mediated AMPK activation and ATG5 interaction. These results provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of FGF21 in the treatment of AS.

[PMID: 31570705] Dyslipidemia-induced atherosclerosis, which has a risk of high morbidity and mortality, can be alleviated by metabolic activation associated with mitochondrial function. The effect of dichloroacetate (DCA), a general pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, on in vivo energy expenditure in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a western diet (WD) has not yet been investigated. WD-fed ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice developed atherosclerotic plaques and hyperlipidemia along with obesity, which were significantly ameliorated by DCA administration. Increased oxygen consumption was associated with heat production in the DCA-treated group, with no change in food intake or physical activity compared with those of the control. These processes were correlated with the increased gene expression of Dio2 and Ucp-1, which represents brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation, in both WD-induced atherosclerosis and high-fat-induced obesity models. In addition, we found that DCA stimulated hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) mRNA expression, which might be important for lowering lipid levels and insulin sensitization via BAT activation, in a dose- and time-dependent manner associated with serum FGF21 levels. Interestingly, Fgf21 mRNA expression was mediated in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner within several minutes after DCA treatment independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Taken together, the results suggest that enhanced glucose oxidation by DCA protects against atherosclerosis by inducing hepatic FGF21 expression and BAT activation, resulting in augmented energy expenditure for heat generation.

[PMID: 26912152] Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Besides its antiobese and antidiabetic activity, FGF21 also possesses the protective effects against atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of FGF21 are elevated in patients with atherosclerosis, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, possibly due to a compensatory upregulation. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, formation of atherosclerotic plaques is exacerbated by genetic depletion of FGF21, but is attenuated upon replenishment with recombinant FGF21. However, the blood vessel is not the direct target of FGF21, and the antiatherosclerotic activity of FGF21 is attributed to its actions in adipose tissues and liver. In adipocytes, FGF21 promotes secretion of adiponectin, which in turn acts directly on blood vessels to reduce endothelial dysfunction, inhibit proliferation of smooth muscle cells and block conversion of macrophages to foam cells. Furthermore, FGF21 suppresses cholesterol biosynthesis and attenuates hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 in hepatocytes. The effects of FGF21 on elevation of adiponectin and reduction of hypercholesterolemia are also observed in a phase-1b clinical trial in patients with obesity and diabetes. Therefore, FGF21 exerts its protection against atherosclerosis by fine-tuning the interorgan crosstalk between liver, brain, adipose tissue, and blood vessels.",10

During the conjugation and deconjugation cycle, SUMO is recognised and positioned by various enzymes through specific non-covalent interactions. This review discusses the core interactions with the SAE2 subunit of the SUMOspecific heterodimeric E1 enzyme SAE1:SAE2, the SUMO E2 enzyme UBC9 and the SUMO-specific proteases of the SENP family and USPL1. We describe the evolutionary origins of these interactions and their structural basis; moreover, as SUMO:enzyme interactions are generally similar in their overall outline to those between ubiquitin and its specific enzymes, we highlight these similarities, as well as the differences. All of the mentioned interactions use a similar surface on SUMO, which is distinct from the groove that binds SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), meaning that while the enzyme interactions are mutually exclusive, each is compatible with simultaneous SIM binding. This review is accompanied by another in the same issue that focuses on interactions with SUMO E3 ligases and downstream effectors of SUMOylation, together providing comprehensive coverage of the non-covalent interactions formed by SUMO proteins.

[PMID: 41187061] Protein ATG8ylation is a post-translational modification where ubiquitin-like protein LC3/ATG8 forms covalent conjugation with cellular proteins, a process reversed by ATG4. In contrast to the well-characterized ATG8 lipidation/membrane ATG8ylation, research on protein ATG8ylation remains limited. In this study, we identify deconjugation-resistant LC3B Q116A and F80A/L82A mutants as tools for protein ATG8ylation. We demonstrate that protein ATG8ylation depends exclusively on ATG4, ATG3, and ATG7. Tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry reveals ATG7 as a substrate of protein ATG8ylation with K140 as its modification site. We show that protein ATG8ylation of ATG7 forms a mono-LC3B conjugate, while ATG3 undergoes lysine-dependent, mixed-linkage poly-LC3B chains. ATG7 and ATG3 function as E1 and E2 enzymes in protein ATG8ylation, potentially cooperating with E3 ligases. Notably, endogenous ATG7 ATG8ylation attenuates autophagy by disrupting its interaction with ATG3. These findings highlight ATG7 as both a central catalytic enzyme and key substrate in autophagy regulation through protein ATG8ylation.

[PMID: 41186814] Hyperammonemia is a key pathological feature of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), yet its associated protein glycosylation remains incompletely understood. Here, we used whole mouse brain tissues from a hyperammonemia mouse model and astrocytes to conduct a comprehensive analysis of glycosylation changes and the corresponding enzyme associated with ammonia. The upregulation of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase, was identified as a response to ammonia stimulation in astrocytes through a mechanism independent of glutamine synthesis and NADPH oxidase. These findings identify O-GlcNAc as an ammonia-sensitive post-translational modification that is associated with hyperammonemia. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of HE and suggests the potential role of O-GlcNAc as a therapeutic target warranting further investigation.

[PMID: 41186784] Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (RIRI) is a major cause of acute kidney injury, with endothelial dysfunction playing a central role in its pathophysiology. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial damage during RIRI remain incompletely understood. We investigated the role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 B (UBE2B) in endothelial cell regulation during RIRI. Our data indicate that upregulation of UBE2B promotes endothelial apoptosis and inhibits proliferation by targeting U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1) for ubiquitination and degradation, thereby modulating the p53/p21 signaling pathway. Furthermore, treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, alleviated endothelial injury in our models, which was associated with reduced UBE2B expression, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. These findings suggest a previously unrecognized role of UBE2B in mediating endothelial dysfunction during RIRI and indicate that targeting this pathway may hold therapeutic potential. Moreover, semaglutide showed protective effects against endothelial damage under our experimental conditions, pointing to a possible strategy for RIRI management that warrants further validation in long-term and clinical studies.

[PMID: 41186629] Costunolide (COS) is a bioactive sesquiterpene lactone compound extracted from Aucklandia lappa, known for its anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, aligning with the traditional Chinese medicine theory of ""clearing heat and dispersing nodules"" in the treatment of breast ailments. Network pharmacology identified EGFR as the core target of COS, with enrichment analysis revealing the EGFR/ERK/AKT axis as a key pathway. Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinity of COS to the EGFR kinase domain, relying on hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. In vitro experiments showed that COS inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, COS increased EGFR ubiquitination, leading to a decrease in EGFR protein levels, thereby inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation and the activation of downstream ERK and Akt signaling pathways. EGF could partially reverse the growth inhibitory effects of COS, confirming the critical role of EGFR. This study elucidates that COS exerts its anti-TNBC effects by inducing EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, thereby inhibiting the ERK/AKT signaling pathway. This finding integrates traditional Chinese medicine theory with modern molecular oncology mechanisms, providing a reference for the development of plant-derived multi-target anticancer drugs.

[PMID: 41186214] Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an uncurable hematologic cancer due to neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells. The role and detailed mechanisms of Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 4 (USP4) in MM remain to be clarified. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK-8 and TUNEL. Molecular expression was determined by RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The morphology of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was observed by ER tracker-red. The protein interaction and ubiquitination level were evaluated by Co-IP. The binding of myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) to the USP4 promoter was confirmed by ChIP and dual luciferase reporter assay. The in vivo growth of MM was monitored by subcutaneous xenograft experiments. USP4 knockdown suppressed MM cell proliferation and triggered ER stress and apoptosis, whereas USP4 overexpression resulted in the opposite effect. Mechanistically, USP4 enhanced nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) protein stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination. MEF2A bound to the USP4 promoter to activate its transcription and expression. The promotive effect of sh-USP4 or sh-MEF2A on ER stress and apoptosis of MM cells was counteracted by NR4A1 or USP4 overexpression. MEF2A deficiency restrained in vivo MM growth by activating ER stress and apoptosis through modulation of the USP4/NR4A1 pathway. MEF2A activates USP4 to repress ER stress and apoptosis of MM cells via deubiquitination of NR4A1, thus favoring MM progression. Our findings identify USP4 as an attractive intervention target for MM therapy.

[PMID: 41185119] Human citrate synthase (hCS) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the aldol condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) to oxaloacetate to form citrate in the TCA cycle. CS activity is important for aerobic exercise performance and basic metabolic function as a housekeeping enzyme. It has been shown through several mass spectrometry-based physiological studies that CS is post-translationally modified (PTM) on numerous residues via acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation reactions. Few follow-up studies have been reported on the impact of PTMs on CS activity. Thus, we kinetically characterized several hCS PTM mimics near and distant from the active site by site-directed mutagenesis coupled with steady-state kinetics. Most modifications had a negative impact on AcCoA k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> but to a much lesser extent on oxaloacetate k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>. Most notably, the K393 acetylation mimic, K393Q displays an increase in K<sub>m</sub> for AcCoA relative to WT by about 30-fold, with no significant change in k<sub>cat</sub>. To complement our kinetic analyses, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on 26 PTM and mutant CS-substrate complexes, providing a combined kinetic and MD simulation approach. Among the MD results, CS K393AcK showed the greatest reduction in AcCoA/CoA binding.

[PMID: 41184514] Ubiquitination is a fundamental eukaryotic protein post-translational modification pathway, in which ubiquitin or a ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) is typically conjugated to a lysine of a target protein. Ubiquitination is initiated by adenylation of the Ubl C terminus, followed by sequential formation of Ubl-cysteine thioester intermediates with E1, E2 and (optionally) E3 proteins before formation of the final Ubl-lysine isopeptide linkage. Recent work has revealed two ubiquitination-related bacterial pathways in the context of antiphage immunity. Bioinformatics analyses have hinted at the existence of additional uncharacterized bacterial pathways that include ubiquitination-like machinery. Here, we describe the architecture and biochemical mechanisms of an alternative Bub (bacterial ubiquitination-like) pathway, revealing structural parallels and mechanistic differences when compared to other ubiquitination pathways. We show that Bub operons encode functional E1, E2 and Ubl proteins that are related to their eukaryotic counterparts but likely function through oxyester rather than thioester intermediates. We also identify an enzyme family in Bub operons with a conserved catalytic site and a role in Ubl-target conjugation. The genomic context of Bub operons suggests that they also function in antiphage immunity and we present evidence that one Bub pathway may regulate translation in response to stress. Overall, our results reveal an uncharacterized family of bacterial ubiquitination-related pathways with a distinctive biochemical mechanism.

[PMID: 41184251] As a key tumor suppressor, KDM6A plays critical roles in maintaining epigenetic homeostasis and suppressing tumorigenesis. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling KDM6A activity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are not well defined. In this study, we employed tissue microarray analysis of clinical specimens to identify Ser829 as a predominant phosphorylation site of KDM6A in HNSCC and other solid tumors. Using mass spectrometry and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that CDK1-mediated phosphorylation at Ser829 enhances KDM6A binding to SFN, leading to its nuclear export and functional inactivation. Integrated chromatin profiling and metabolic analyses revealed that phosphorylated KDM6A-pSer829 drives glycolytic reprogramming through H3K27Me3-dependent transcriptional silencing of PER2, ultimately promoting tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings establish KDM6A post-translational modification as a pivotal regulator of metabolic adaptation in HNSCC progression, providing a potential therapeutic target for combating cancer through this epigenetic-metabolic axis.

[PMID: 41184241] Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma with myogenic features affecting children and adolescents. The high-risk fusion-positive RMS subtype (FP-RMS), driven by the oncogenic chimeric transcription factor PAX3-FOXO1, shows 5-year overall survival not exceeding 30%. Here, we examine the impact of neddylation inhibition, a post-translational modification in which the NEDD8 peptide is conjugated to proteins, on the tumorigenic properties of FP-RMS. Here, we report that the NAE1 and UBA3 genes encoding the two subunits of the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) heterodimer are upregulated in FP-RMS patients compared to healthy skeletal muscle tissues and highly expressed in RMS among several tumor types. Furthermore, DepMap analyses showed that FP-RMS cell lines are among the most sensitive to both NAE1 and UBA3 CRISPR-mediated knockout as well as to NAE pharmacological inhibition with MLN4924 compared to other cancer cell lines. In agreement, FP-RMS cells treated in vitro with MLN4924 (Pevonedistat) exhibited cell proliferation decrease, G2/M cell cycle arrest, senescence, and caspase- and PARP1-dependent apoptosis. These phenotypes were associated with increased γH2AX nuclear foci and protein levels, DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and reduced RAD51 levels. NAE1 and UBA3 individual silencing mirrors the major effects of MLN4924. In addition, MLN4924 also prevented FP-RMS tumor growth in vivo. Combining MLN4924 with irradiation enhanced apoptosis and the inhibition of colony formation, cell cycle progression, and anchorage-independent and tumor spheroids growth compared to single treatments. Molecularly, MLN4924 amplified the irradiation-induced DNA damage by increasing γH2AX and DSBs, while reducing RAD51 expression and DNA-PKcs activation, both of which are involved in DNA repair. Collectively, our results suggest that the neddylation pathway is deregulated in FP-RMS, representing a potential therapeutic target. Therefore, MLN4924 could be considered as an anti-tumorigenic compound and a novel radiosensitizer in FP-RMS.",10
MafA ubiquitination decreases the recruitment of coavtivator P/CAF by MafA.,MafA AND ubiquitination AND P/CAF AND coactivator,"18042454,41187110,41187091,41187080,41187061,41186850,41186784,41186656,41186629,41186416","[PMID: 18042454] The Maf oncoproteins are b-Zip transcription factors of the AP-1 superfamily. They are involved in developmental, metabolic, and tumorigenic processes. Maf proteins are overexpressed in about 50% of human multiple myelomas. Here, we show that Maf-transforming activity is controlled by GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation and that phosphorylation by GSK-3 can increase the oncogenic activity of a protein. Using microarray analysis, we identify a gene-expression subprogram regulated by GSK-3-mediated Maf phosphorylation involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and relevant to cancer progression. We also demonstrate that GSK-3 triggers MafA sequential phosphorylation on residues S61, T57, T53, and S49, inducing its ubiquitination and degradation. Paradoxically, this phosphorylation increases MafA-transcriptional activity through the recruitment of the coactivator P/CAF. We further demonstrate that P/CAF protects MafA from ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that, upon the release of the coactivator complex, MafA becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded to allow the response to terminate.

[PMID: 41187091] SUMOylation - a protein post-translational modification (PTM) related to ubiquitylation - involves the reversible covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to proteins. During the conjugation and deconjugation cycle, SUMO is recognised and positioned by various enzymes through specific non-covalent interactions. This review discusses the core interactions with the SAE2 subunit of the SUMOspecific heterodimeric E1 enzyme SAE1:SAE2, the SUMO E2 enzyme UBC9 and the SUMO-specific proteases of the SENP family and USPL1. We describe the evolutionary origins of these interactions and their structural basis; moreover, as SUMO:enzyme interactions are generally similar in their overall outline to those between ubiquitin and its specific enzymes, we highlight these similarities, as well as the differences. All of the mentioned interactions use a similar surface on SUMO, which is distinct from the groove that binds SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), meaning that while the enzyme interactions are mutually exclusive, each is compatible with simultaneous SIM binding. This review is accompanied by another in the same issue that focuses on interactions with SUMO E3 ligases and downstream effectors of SUMOylation, together providing comprehensive coverage of the non-covalent interactions formed by SUMO proteins.

[PMID: 41187080] Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP) plays a critical role in host defense against invading pathogens, including <i><i>Listeria</i> monocytogenes (<i>Listeria. monocytogenes</i>)</i>, <i><i>Salmonella typhimurium (<i>S. typhimurium</i>)</i></i>, and <i>Francisella novicida (<i>F. novicida</i>)</i>. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms controlling LAP remain poorly understood. Here, we identify enkurin domain-containing protein 1 (ENKD1) as a key negative regulator of LAP during infection with these pathogens. Macrophages infected with <i><i>L.</i> monocytogenes</i> (10403S), <i>S. typhimurium</i> (ATCC14028), or <i>F. novicida</i> (U112) exhibit significant ENKD1 downregulation. ENKD1-deficient macrophages display enhanced antibacterial activity, characterized by increased LAP, higher reactive oxygen species production, enhanced LC3 lipidation on phagosomes, and improved phagosome-lysosome fusion. In vivo, ENKD1<i>-</i>deficient mice <i>ex</i>hibited improved bacterial clearance in the liver and spleen, with notable survival benefits. Mechanistically, ENKD1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), which mediates degradation of Run domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein (RUBCN) through K48-linked polyubiquitination, thereby dampening RUBCN's role in LAP. Our findings reveal an ENKD1-TRIM21-RUBCN axis that suppresses LAP, providing insights into antibacterial immune regulation and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to enhance host defense against intracellular pathogens.

[PMID: 41187061] Protein ATG8ylation is a post-translational modification where ubiquitin-like protein LC3/ATG8 forms covalent conjugation with cellular proteins, a process reversed by ATG4. In contrast to the well-characterized ATG8 lipidation/membrane ATG8ylation, research on protein ATG8ylation remains limited. In this study, we identify deconjugation-resistant LC3B Q116A and F80A/L82A mutants as tools for protein ATG8ylation. We demonstrate that protein ATG8ylation depends exclusively on ATG4, ATG3, and ATG7. Tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry reveals ATG7 as a substrate of protein ATG8ylation with K140 as its modification site. We show that protein ATG8ylation of ATG7 forms a mono-LC3B conjugate, while ATG3 undergoes lysine-dependent, mixed-linkage poly-LC3B chains. ATG7 and ATG3 function as E1 and E2 enzymes in protein ATG8ylation, potentially cooperating with E3 ligases. Notably, endogenous ATG7 ATG8ylation attenuates autophagy by disrupting its interaction with ATG3. These findings highlight ATG7 as both a central catalytic enzyme and key substrate in autophagy regulation through protein ATG8ylation.

[PMID: 41186784] Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (RIRI) is a major cause of acute kidney injury, with endothelial dysfunction playing a central role in its pathophysiology. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial damage during RIRI remain incompletely understood. We investigated the role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 B (UBE2B) in endothelial cell regulation during RIRI. Our data indicate that upregulation of UBE2B promotes endothelial apoptosis and inhibits proliferation by targeting U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1) for ubiquitination and degradation, thereby modulating the p53/p21 signaling pathway. Furthermore, treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, alleviated endothelial injury in our models, which was associated with reduced UBE2B expression, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. These findings suggest a previously unrecognized role of UBE2B in mediating endothelial dysfunction during RIRI and indicate that targeting this pathway may hold therapeutic potential. Moreover, semaglutide showed protective effects against endothelial damage under our experimental conditions, pointing to a possible strategy for RIRI management that warrants further validation in long-term and clinical studies.

[PMID: 41186656] Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by pathological changes such as articular cartilage degeneration and bone hyperplasia. Mitochondrial dysfunction in chondrocytes has been identified as a critical factor contributing to the progression of OA. Although Evodiamine (Evo) has been demonstrated effeicacy in inhibiting inflammatory responses and matrix degradation in OA chondrocytes, its effects and underlying mechanisms regarding mitochondrial dysfunction in these cells remain to be elucidated. IL-1β was utilized to stimulate chondrocytes in order to establish an in vitro OA model. Subsequently, the proliferation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and apoptosis of chondrocytes were systematically evaluated. Mitochondrial function in chondrocytes was evaluated by quantifying of ATP content, ROS level, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain Complexes I and III, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential change. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of the SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway were examined, and an intervention involving the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 was conducted to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of Evo on chondrocytes. Evo treatment significantly elevated the proliferation activity of IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes, inhibited LDH release and apoptosis, increased mtDNA copy number and ATP content, enhanced the enzymatic activities of Complexes I and III, and suppressed ROS production as well as mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Furthermore, Evo treatment activated the SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway. However, the addition of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 partially attenuated the protective effects of Evo against IL-1β-induced chondrocyte injury by exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction. Evo promotes mitochondrial biosynthesis, reduces ROS production and improves mitochondrial function by activating SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway, thereby inhibiting IL-1β-induced chondrocyte injury.

[PMID: 41186629] Costunolide (COS) is a bioactive sesquiterpene lactone compound extracted from Aucklandia lappa, known for its anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, aligning with the traditional Chinese medicine theory of ""clearing heat and dispersing nodules"" in the treatment of breast ailments. Network pharmacology identified EGFR as the core target of COS, with enrichment analysis revealing the EGFR/ERK/AKT axis as a key pathway. Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinity of COS to the EGFR kinase domain, relying on hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. In vitro experiments showed that COS inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, COS increased EGFR ubiquitination, leading to a decrease in EGFR protein levels, thereby inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation and the activation of downstream ERK and Akt signaling pathways. EGF could partially reverse the growth inhibitory effects of COS, confirming the critical role of EGFR. This study elucidates that COS exerts its anti-TNBC effects by inducing EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, thereby inhibiting the ERK/AKT signaling pathway. This finding integrates traditional Chinese medicine theory with modern molecular oncology mechanisms, providing a reference for the development of plant-derived multi-target anticancer drugs.

[PMID: 41186416] Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes severe intestinal disease in piglets, employs sophisticated strategies to subvert host antiviral immunity. While type III interferons (IFN-III) play a pivotal role in mucosal defense at intestinal epithelial barriers, the mechanisms underlying PEDV evasion of IFN-III signaling remain poorly understood. Given that peroxisomes serve as critical platforms for IFN-III signaling and that their abundance influences immune activation, we investigated the role of pexophagy in PEDV-mediated immune evasion. We demonstrated that the PEDV nonstructural protein NSP8 functions as a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-dependent IFN-III production. Functional analyses revealed that NSP8 significantly reduces peroxisomal protein levels and promotes pexophagy. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry identified a direct interaction between NSP8 and PEX13. NSP8 also induces dose-dependent degradation of PEX13 via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. This downregulation of PEX13 triggers ubiquitination of the peroxisomal import receptor PEX5, facilitating its recognition by the autophagy receptor NBR1 and the ubiquitin ligase PEX2, thereby promoting autophagic clearance of peroxisomes. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel immune evasion strategy in which PEDV exploits NSP8 to disrupt peroxisome homeostasis by targeting PEX13, thereby dismantling MAVS-dependent IFN-III antiviral signaling through pexophagy. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) NSP8 is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in viral replication. Investigating the functional mechanisms of NSP8 contributes to a deeper understanding of PEDV pathogenesis and supports the development of antiviral strategies against coronaviruses. In this study, we elucidate how NSP8 suppresses type Ⅲ interferon (IFN-Ⅲ) production by promoting pexophagy through the downregulation of PEX13. We demonstrate that NSP8 directly interacts with PEX13 and enhances the ubiquitination of PEX5, leading to reduced peroxisome abundance and impaired mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated IFN-Ⅲ signaling. These findings suggest that NSP8 hijacks the PEX13-dependent pexophagy pathway as a means of evading host antiviral defenses. This work provides critical insights into the interplay between viral proteins and host cellular machinery and highlights the NSP8-PEX13 axis as a promising target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing antiviral immunity against PEDV and related coronaviruses.",10

Over the last decade, significant progress in endoscopic techniques and technologies has improved the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of these procedures. Current methods, such as intragastric balloons, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, and endoscopic-assisted gastrojejunostomy, have promoted weight loss, improving the metabolic health of obese individuals, with emerging evidence suggesting that their combination with pharmacological agents could further maximize their benefit. Emerging technologies, such as robotic-assisted endoscopic devices, advanced imaging systems, and biodegradable implants, could enhance procedural precision, minimize complications, and provide more personalized treatment options. In contrast, novel approaches such as microbiome modulation and tissue regeneration could have an adjunct role in improving patient outcomes. This review provides a brief overview of the current status of endoscopic bariatrics, highlighting the most common procedures and emerging technologies. It also discusses the challenges and future directions for the field, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, patient selection, and research priorities to establish the long-term benefit and effectiveness of the available endoscopic bariatric interventions.

[PMID: 41160098] One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is safe and effective treatment for patients with severe obesity. OAGB with a biliopancreatic limb (BPL) of 200-250 cm often leads to metabolic and nutritional issues, which may be mitigated by using a shorter biliopancreatic limb (BPL) length (170-180 cm). However, the impact of shorter BPL lengths on efficacy remains uncertain. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent OAGB at two Iranian centers between March 2018 and March 2021. Patients were divided into two groups based on BPL length: 170-180 cm and 200-250 cm. Groups were compared for weight loss, nutritional status, and comorbidity resolution over two years. Both groups achieved comparable weight loss (BMI reduction: 28.4 vs. 28.3 kg/m², p = 0.913), with complete hypertension resolution observed in 95.6%of hypertensive patients and complete diabetes remission in 90% of diabetic patients. Nutritional outcomes were comparable between groups (albumin, vitamin D, B12), though ferritin levels were numerically lower in the 200-250 cm group. Despite concerns about malnutrition following OAGB, our findings demonstrate that a 170-180 cm BPL achieves weight loss and comorbidity resolution comparable to a 200-250 cm BPL, with reduced nutritional risks. OAGB with a 170-180 cm BPL yields weight loss and comorbidity resolution comparable to a 200-250 cm BPL, with potentially fewer nutritional deficiencies.

[PMID: 41153084] Acquired hypothalamic obesity (aHO) following craniopharyngioma (CP) is a challenging condition with limited therapeutic options. This study aimed to assess the real-world effectiveness and safety of GLP-1 RAs in this population. CranioGLP1 is a retrospective multicentre study including 116 adults with aHO treated with one or more GLP-1 RAs across 16 French obesity centres. Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data were collected from medical records. Weight outcomes, adverse events, and predictors of response were analysed. Patients had a mean age of 44.4 ± 13.5 years and a mean BMI of 40.1 ± 8.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 42% had type 2 diabetes. Over a mean follow-up of 44 months, mean weight loss was -4.6% (±12.5), with high interindividual variability; 51% achieved ≥5% weight loss, and 28% ≥10%. Semaglutide (mean dose 1.2 mg/week) was associated with the greatest reduction (-6.8%), particularly in patients without diabetes (-8.5% ± 12.3 vs. -3.9% ± 10.0 in those with diabetes; p = 0.032). Endocrine adverse events occurred in 12% and 10% of patients with adrenal or vasopressin deficiency decompensation, respectively, with 8% requiring hospitalisation. Gastrointestinal intolerance led to treatment discontinuation in 13% of cases. GLP-1 RAs at submaximal doses induce moderate, yet clinically meaningful weight loss in adults with aHO, with semaglutide showing the highest efficacy. Given the non-negligible risk of hormonal decompensation, specific endocrine monitoring is essential.

[PMID: 41111360] We aimed at comparing different approved strategies (obesity management medications-OMM, endoscopic bariatric procedures-EBP, and metabolic bariatric surgery-MBS) with lifestyle intervention/placebo/no therapy (LSI/Pbo/NT) for the treatment of different BMI-based classes of obesity (i.e., overweight-BMI: 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; class I-BMI: 30-34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; class II-BMI: 35-39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; class III-BMI >39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). This systematic review (SR) and network meta-analysis (NMA) included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing OMM, EBP, and MBS versus either LSI/Pbo/NT or active comparators in individuals with overweight or obesity. A Medline and Embase search was performed up to 31st January 2025 for RCTs on EMA (European Medicines Agency)-approved weight-loss interventions in adults with overweight/obesity. The primary endpoint was total body weight loss (TBWL%), analysed at different time points: 26-52, 53-104, 105-156, and ≥156 weeks. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, quality of life, and serious adverse events (SAE). Weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (WMD, 95% CI) for continuous variables and Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (MH-OR, 95% CI) for categorical variables were calculated using random effect models. The study was registered on the PROSPERO website (CRD42024625338). In trials enroling subjects in class I of obesity, tirzepatide resulted in equal effectiveness to both OAGB and RYGB, and it was significantly superior to all the other comparisons. In trials on class II of obesity, tirzepatide was significantly superior to all the other comparisons and inferior to both OAGB and RYGB. Semaglutide was associated with a higher TBWL% than the other OMMs (with the notable exception of tirzepatide), and it was equally effective to EBP, GCP, and LAGB. In trials enroling patients with a mean BMI >40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the procedure with the highest estimated weight loss was BPD. Semaglutide was statistically less effective than SG and gastric bypass, but not inferior to GCP and LAGB. Both RYGB and OAGB were superior to SG. In patients affected by mild to moderate obesity, newer OMMs (i.e., tirzepatide and semaglutide) appear to be valid alternatives to EBP and MBS. They could be preliminarily chosen as a first-line option based on similar efficacy and greater safety and tolerability. Higher degrees of obesity could be more effectively treated with MBS, the efficacy of which, with the notable exception of LAGB and GCP, appears superior to other treatments, especially in the long term.

[PMID: 41098876] Obesity imposes a heavy burden on healthcare systems and society. Despite various treatment options, choosing cost-effective pharmacological interventions remains a key concern for health policymakers. This study systematically reviews economic evaluations of antiobesity drugs, comparing their costs and outcomes with those of lifestyle interventions. A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) were searched for full economic evaluations of FDA-approved antiobesity drugs, including semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide, phentermine-topiramate, and orlistat. Inclusion criteria required studies to report cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, or cost-benefit outcomes. Data on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), or disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were extracted and adjusted to 2024 USD using PPP. Study quality was assessed using CHEERS 2022. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most used Markov models and cost-effectiveness analyses. The review of articles showed that 60% of the articles were conducted in the United States of America, 33.33% of the articles in Europe, and 6.66% of the articles in Australia. Among the reviewed studies, semaglutide was found to be the most cost-effective and clinically effective drug in most scenarios. Phentermine-topiramate showed acceptable cost-effectiveness, particularly in low-resource settings. Orlistat and naltrexone-bupropion were also considered affordable options, though with lower effectiveness. Tirzepatide, despite its high efficacy, demonstrated a higher ICER, making its cost-effectiveness context-dependent. These findings highlight the importance of integrating cost-effective pharmacological treatments into obesity management strategies. Semaglutide appears to be a highly effective and economically favorable option, while phentermine-topiramate and orlistat offer practical alternatives in resource-limited settings. Economic evaluations can inform policy decisions and optimize healthcare resource allocation in combating obesity.

[PMID: 41091899] Patients with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) experience significant metabolic side effects from antipsychotic medications, including antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). This contributes to a high prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes in this population, ultimately reducing life expectancy. Traditional weight management strategies, such as behavioural interventions, are often less feasible in this group. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), initially developed for type 2 diabetes, have shown promise in addressing AIWG by reducing weight, improving metabolic parameters, and offering potential neuroprotective and psychiatric benefits. Evidence supports the efficacy of GLP-1RAs in managing AIWG, with studies demonstrating substantial reductions in weight and body mass index without exacerbating psychiatric symptoms. However, access to these medications remains limited due to high costs and restrictive healthcare policies. Expanding access to GLP-1RAs could bridge a critical gap in care for patients with SPMI, improving both physical and mental health outcomes. Future research should focus on evaluating long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the Canadian healthcare context, to inform policy changes and optimize treatment strategies.

[PMID: 41074095] The study aimed to evaluate real-world data on liraglutide by assessing its efficacy, associated side effects, adverse events, and impact on metabolic parameters within the context of a multicenter national study. This retrospective observational study analyzed data from 1009 patients across 38 endocrinology units from Türkiye. Patients with a history of bariatric surgery, those who started orlistat concurrently with liraglutide, and one patient who developed pancreatitis on the 15th day of treatment were excluded from the analyses of weight and laboratory changes. At least one side effect was observed in 48% of the patients, with nausea and vomiting being the most common. The most frequent reason for discontinuing treatment was the cost of the medication (42.6%). The median duration of liraglutide use was 4 months (IQR; 3-6), and the median dose was 2.4 mg (IQR; 1.8-3). Among the entire cohort, 76.4% and 40.9% of patients achieved a 5% and 10% weight loss target, respectively. Significant reductions were observed in metabolic parameters during the treatment. The treatment duration was identified as an independent predictor for achieving 5% and 10% weight loss targets (B = 0.315, p < 0.001) and 10% weight loss (B = 0.216, p < 0.001). Liraglutide effectively results in clinically significant weight loss, achieves expected weight loss targets, and improves metabolic parameters in real-world clinical practice. Therefore, liraglutide is still a reasonable GLP-1 analogue in the obesity treatment. However, it may be associated with various side effects, necessitating close monitoring by clinicians.

[PMID: 41057950] Overweight and obesity have a negative impact on health and have a detrimental effect on the operational readiness of soldiers. Different prevention and intervention measures against obesity include diet, physical activity, education, coaching or medication or a combination of several aspects have been investigated. This review systematically assesses the effectiveness of lifestyle, dietary, educational, and pharmacological interventions on weight, body composition, and military readiness in active-duty personnel. We carried out a systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search was conducted in various electronic databases from 2000 to July 2024. The search strategy combined three concepts: military population, outcome terms, interventions or programs. For the review, 21 articles met the inclusion criteria (total n = 1696). Where possible, the effect size (ES) was calculated. In studies that only examined exercise, minor effects were reported, e.g. a reduction in weight (-0.5 kg), Body Mass Index (BMI) (-0.3 kg/m²), waist circumference (-0.1 cm) and body fat percentage (-1.1%) without relevant statistical ES. Studies with nutritional programs reported low to moderate ES. Combined programs including dietary and exercise countermeasures showed to be more effective than programs based on diet or exercise alone. Combined programs with exercise and educational methods showed a moderate to large effect size (ES 0.6-1.3) for weight reduction. Pharmacological treatment for reducing fat intake resulted in a larger effect sizes for weight loss. The greatest efficacy (ES > 1.0) was observed for a combined intervention program consisting of lifestyle changing components based on individually tailored cognitive behavioral therapies, psychoeducation, exercise and nutritional interventions. Effective countermeasure for reducing body weight found in this study were combined interventions, like education on lifestyle changes, dietary habits and promotion of physical activity in military personnel, as well as by ketogenic dietary interventions combined with physical activity and followed by pharmacological intervention approaches. Combined interventions appear promising in some studies, but future evaluations may focus on combinations of physical activity and exercise with new pharmaceutical approaches like Semaglutide or Bimagrumab medication in the long term for military personnel due to probable favorable body composition adaptations and military readiness.

[PMID: 41054439] Obesity remains a major global public health challenge, particularly among surgical patients, where it can be associated with increased perioperative and longer-term risk. While preoperative weight management strategies are often used to mitigate these risks, scalable interventions remain limited. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are an emerging pharmacological approach for weight loss, but their perioperative safety remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of preoperative GLP-1 therapy in elective surgical systems. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to March 31, 2025, for studies evaluating preoperative GLP-1 RA use in adults undergoing elective surgery, with no language restriction. The primary outcome was perioperative safety, defined as any complication within 90 days after surgery. The secondary outcome was preoperative weight loss. Both frequentist and Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression was used to explore effect modifiers on the primary outcome. A risk-of-bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment were done to determine the certainty of the evidence. Final GRADE judgements were made by two independent reviewers, with consensus reached through discussion. Between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> statistic and visualised using a standard forest plot. Potential publication bias and small study effects were assessed using visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger's test. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251027809. A total of 21 studies, comprising 97,059 patients, met inclusion criteria; 31.9% (n = 30,981) received preoperative GLP-1 RA therapy. Most studies were single-centre observational cohorts from high-income countries, with no randomised trials identified. Postoperative complications were reported in 12 studies, with no evidence of increased risk in GLP-1 users (pooled odds ratio: 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-1.05). The pooled estimate shows high heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 73%). Bayesian meta-analysis yielded consistent findings (posterior mean OR: 0.78; 95% credible interval: 0.57-1.12). Meta-regression identified no statistically significant modifiers of treatment effect to explain the heterogeneity. The overall GRADE assessment for certainty of evidence was very low. In studies reporting weight loss, preoperative GLP-1 RA use was associated with weight loss of up to 16.7 kg or 6.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> over six months, though reporting varied across studies. Preoperative GLP-1 RA therapy may support clinically meaningful weight loss without a clear signal of increased perioperative risk, offering a potentially scalable strategy for surgical optimisation. However, the certainty of current evidence is very low, with most studies observational in design and at risk of bias. Amid rising global obesity rates and mounting surgical backlogs, the role of GLP-1RAs in perioperative care remains a critical unanswered question. Robust randomised trials are needed to establish their clinical value, cost-effectiveness, and implementation potential across diverse surgical systems. Prioritisation by funders and policymakers are needed as part of broader health policy agendas to improve population health and health system resilience.

[PMID: 41039116] This systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of obesity management medications (OMMs) in terms of reducing body weight and impact on obesity-related complications. Here a Medline and Embase search was performed up to 31 January 2025 for randomized controlled trials comparing OMMs versus placebo/active comparators in adults. Primary endpoint was percentage of total body weight loss (TBWL%) at the end of the study. Secondary endpoints were TBWL% at 1, 2 and ≥3 years, lipid profile, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, mental health, serious adverse events, quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, remission of obesity-related complications and all-cause mortality. Fifty-six clinical trials were identified-orlistat (22), semaglutide (14), liraglutide (11), tirzepatide (6), naltrexone/bupropion (5) and phentermine/topiramate (2)-enrolling 60,307 patients (32,598 OMM and 27,709 placebo). All OMMs showed a significantly greater TBWL% versus placebo (P < 0.0001), more than 10% for semaglutide and tirzepatide. Both tirzepatide and semaglutide showed normoglycemia restoration, remission of type 2 diabetes and reduction in hospitalization due to heart failure. Semaglutide was effective in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and reducing pain in knee osteoarthritis. Tirzepatide was effective in remission of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. These results support the need to individualize the selection of OMMs.",10
Medications to treat obesity do not have side effects.,obesity medications AND side effect profile AND safety analysis AND adverse effects comparison,"31845767,41187356,41187327,41187314,41187282,41187267,41187263,41187261,41187251,41187231","[PMID: 31845767] Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by infrequent or absent ovulation, and high levels of androgens and insulin (hyperinsulinaemia). Hyperinsulinaemia occurs secondary to insulin resistance and is associated with an increased biochemical risk profile for cardiovascular disease and an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Insulin-sensitising agents such as metformin may be effective in treating PCOS-related anovulation. This is an update of Morley 2017 and only includes studies on metformin. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of metformin in combination with or in comparison to clomiphene citrate (CC), letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) in improving reproductive outcomes and associated gastrointestinal side effects for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction. We searched the following databases from inception to December 2018: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL. We searched registers of ongoing trials and reference lists from relevant studies. We included randomised controlled trials of metformin compared with placebo, no treatment, or in combination with or compared with CC, letrozole and LOD for women with PCOS subfertility. Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and bias. Primary outcomes were live birth rate and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Secondary outcomes included other pregnancy outcomes and ovulation. We combined data to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic and reported quality of the evidence for primary outcomes and reproductive outcomes using GRADE methodology. We included 41 studies (4552 women). Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate based on GRADE assessment. Limitations were risk of bias (poor reporting of methodology and incomplete outcome data), imprecision and inconsistency. Metformin versus placebo or no treatment The evidence suggests that metformin may improve live birth rates compared with placebo (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.51; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 4 studies, 435 women; low-quality evidence). For a live birth rate of 19% following placebo, the live birth rate following metformin would be between 19% and 37%. The metformin group probably experiences more gastrointestinal side effects (OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.63 to 6.09; I<sup>2</sup> = 39%; 7 studies, 713 women; moderate-quality evidence). With placebo, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% whereas with metformin this risk is between 22% and 40%. There are probably higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.65; I<sup>2</sup> = 30%; 11 studies, 1213 women; moderate-quality evidence). There may be higher rates of ovulation with metformin (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.85 to 3.75; I<sup>2</sup> = 61%; 13 studies, 684 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on miscarriage rates (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.35; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 4 studies, 748 women; low-quality evidence). Metformin plus CC versus CC alone We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.65; I<sup>2</sup> = 28%; 10 studies, 1219 women; low-quality evidence), but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common with combined therapy (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.40; I<sup>2</sup> = 8%; 6 studies, 852 women; moderate quality evidence). The live birth rate with CC alone is 24%, which may change to between 23% to 34% with combined therapy. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with combined therapy. The combined therapy group probably has higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.99; I<sup>2</sup> = 31%; 19 studies, 1790 women; moderate-quality evidence). The combined group may have higher rates of ovulation (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.03; I<sup>2</sup> = 63%;21 studies, 1568 women; low-quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.00; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 10 studies, 1206 women; low-quality evidence). Metformin versus CC When all studies were combined, findings for live birth were inconclusive and inconsistent (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 86%; 5 studies, 741 women; very low-quality evidence). In subgroup analysis by obesity status, obese women had a lower birth rate in the metformin group (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.52; 2 studies, 500 women), while the non-obese group showed a possible benefit from metformin, with high heterogeneity (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.94; I<sup>2</sup> = 78%, 3 studies, 241 women; very low-quality evidence). However, due to the very low quality of the evidence we cannot draw any conclusions. Among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.55; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low-quality evidence) and ovulation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.43; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low-quality evidence) while among non-obese women, the metformin group may have more pregnancies (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.29; I<sup>2</sup> = 26%; 6 studies, 530 women; low-quality evidence) and no clear difference in ovulation rates (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.25; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 5 studies, 352 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between the groups (overall: OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.66; I<sup>2</sup> = 36%; 6 studies, 781 women; low-quality evidence) and no studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. Our updated review suggests that metformin may be beneficial over placebo for live birth however, more women probably experience gastrointestinal side effects. We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably increased with combined therapy. When metformin was compared with CC, data for live birth were inconclusive, and the findings were limited by lack of evidence. Results differed by body mass index (BMI), emphasising the importance of stratifying results by BMI. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects in this comparison. Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage in all three comparisons.

[PMID: 41187356] Accurate and sensitive detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is essential for ensuring food safety. In this study, a nanozyme-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor was developed through a triple signal amplification strategy. A hollow-structured h-CdS coupled with TiO<sub>2</sub> formed a highly efficient heterojunction that enhanced light absorption, light scattering, and charge separation, resulting in significantly improved photoelectric conversion efficiency. A single-atom Fe-MNC nanozyme possessing both peroxidase- and oxidase-like activities was synthesized via a cascade anchoring strategy, successfully catalyzing a biocatalytic precipitation (BCP) reaction for signal amplification. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validated the energy band structure of the heterojunction and the catalytic superiority of Fe-MNC. Additionally, a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) was rationally designed based on the AFB1 aptamer to achieve target-specific recognition and probe amplification. By integrating these three synergistic elements, the constructed nanozyme-based PEC aptasensor enabled highly sensitive detection of AFB1 with a detection limit of 2.04 fg/mL and a linear range from 0.005 to 100 pg/mL. The sensor demonstrated excellent stability and selectivity and showed good agreement with HPLC results when applied to real sample analysis, highlighting its practical potential for food safety monitoring.

[PMID: 41187327] Neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized as pain arising from lesions of the somatosensory nervous system. However, NP-like features have been found in several chronic secondary musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions in the absence of detectable lesion or damage to the somatosensory pathways. Emerging evidence has demonstrated associations between NP-like symptoms and altered neural activity within brain regions implicated in sensory perception and affective-emotional processing of pain with consistent findings of abnormal activity in the right insula (RIns) cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG-NF) is a brain-computer interface biofeedback technique that allows individuals to self-regulate the real-time cortical brain activities of the regions of interest. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of a novel EEG-NF intervention designed to simultaneously downtrain activity in the RIns and dACC in individuals with a chronic secondary MSK pain condition exhibiting NP-like features. In addition, this study will conduct secondary exploratory analyses to investigate EEG-derived neuronal changes and their associations with clinical and experimental pain outcomes following the EEG-NF training. We will design a single-arm, open-label, pilot-feasibility trial. We will recruit adults aged 35-75 years with a score of ≥19 using the PainDETECT questionnaire and an average pain score of ≥4 on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the last 3 months, with a minimum pain duration of 3 months, to receive active EEG-NF training. Participants will receive auditory feedback as a reward for achieving a predetermined activity threshold of the RIns and dACC. Primary outcomes will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and safety using both self-reported questionnaires and monitoring data. Collected data will be summarized descriptively, with mean (SD) reported where appropriate. Secondary outcomes will include EEG parameters, self-reported measures, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing. An exploratory within-group pre-post statistical comparison will be conducted for all secondary outcome measures, and correlation analysis will be performed to explore relationships between EEG measures, self-reported outcomes, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing measures. This study has received approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Participant recruitment began in April 2025 and is ongoing. As of October 2025, data collection has been completed, with a total of 5 participants enrolled, all of whom have completed the study to date. We expect to complete the study in March 2026. This study will generate data on feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary data to inform a fully powered effectiveness clinical trial. The results and data generated will inform the design and sample size calculation for a fully powered randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of EEG-NF in targeting NP-like features in individuals with chronic MSK pain.

[PMID: 41187314] A global aging population seeking resolution of pain and functional decline from degenerative spine conditions is leading to an increasing number of spine surgeries. The recovery process is complex with many cognitive and physical actions performed by the patient, which can be conceptualized as patient work. Shaped by the dynamic patient work system (PWS), patient work is the time and effort patients complete at home and across health settings to meet their health goals. Our aim was to define factors in the PWS that influence the patient work of older adults' recovery during the hospital and posthospitalization phases as well as by discharge location after spine surgery.METHODS: Secondary data analysis (28 interviews) using deductive and inductive qualitative content analysis methods was used to describe PWS influencing factors. The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety 2.0 human factors framework (person, organization, task, tools and technology, and internal and external environments) guided independent (3 members) coding, codebook evolution, and team deductive analysis. Care phase and discharge location were further analyzed using team inductive analysis.RESULTS: In nearly all components, factor differences were present between discharge to home or skilled nursing facility or inpatient rehabilitation. These differences included pain severity, mobility, unexpected experiences, education not meeting their needs, the level of problem-solving required, and types of benchmarks to their goal of recovery.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that regardless of discharge disposition, older adults experience uncertainty and different needs during recovery that often generate invisible work in navigating the recovery process. Participants describe significant work to clarify any uncertainty and meet their recovery needs. Nursing has a pivotal role to further investigate strategies to help patients achieve their recovery goals.

[PMID: 41187282] Opioid overdose is a global public health emergency, with the United States experiencing high rates of morbidity and mortality due to prescription and illicit opioid use. Traditional public health monitoring systems often fail to provide real-time insights, limiting their capacity for early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, especially Reddit, offer a promising alternative for timely toxicovigilance due to the abundance of user-generated, real-time content. This study aimed to explore the use of Reddit as a real-time, high-volume source for toxicovigilance and develop an automated system that can classify and analyze opioid-related social media posts to detect behavioral patterns and monitor the evolution of public discourse on opioid use. To investigate evolving social media discourse around opioid use, we collected a large-scale dataset from Reddit spanning 6 years, from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2023. Using a comprehensive opioid lexicon-including formal drug names, street slang, common misspellings, and abbreviations-we filtered relevant posts for further analysis. A subset of these data was manually annotated according to well-defined annotation guidelines into 4 categories: self-misuse, external misuse, information, and unrelated, with distributions of 37.21%, 27.25%, 27.57%, and 7.97%, respectively. To automate the classification of opioid-related chatter, we developed a robust natural language processing pipeline leveraging classical machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and transformer-based architecture, and fine-tuned a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM; OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo). In the final stage, the trained LLM was deployed on an unlabeled dataset comprising 74,975 additional Reddit chatter posts. This enabled a detailed temporal analysis of opioid-related discussions, aligned with 6 years of opioid-related death records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For this study, self-misuse and external misuse were merged into a misuse category for direct comparison with the CDC's mortality data, examining whether trends in social media discourse on opioid misuse reflect patterns in real-world mortality statistics. The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 0.93, outperforming the baseline (random forest 0.85) by representing a performance improvement of 9.14% over the machine learning model. The temporal analysis of the unlabeled data revealed evolving trends in opioid-related discussions, indicating shifts in user behavior and overdose-related chatter over time. To quantify this relationship, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between misuse-related posts and CDC death records (r=0.854). This correlation was statistically significant (P<.001), indicating a strong positive relationship between web-based discussions and CDC mortality data. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating advanced natural language processing techniques and LLMs with social media data to support real-time public health surveillance. Reddit provides a valuable platform for identifying emerging trends in opioid use and overdose risk. The proposed system offers a proactive tool for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to better understand and respond to the opioid crisis.

[PMID: 41187267] The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Specifically, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic data sets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yields 1,865 high-confidence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular fingerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding affinity profiles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

[PMID: 41187263] Diagnostics, treatment, and research of persisting postconcussion symptoms are challenging. Assessing symptoms is essential, but currently implemented methods only allow for retrospective reporting of symptoms. A mobile health (mHealth) symptom mapping app for adults with persisting postconcussion symptoms may be an accessible and cost-efficient alternative. This study aimed to develop a research-based mobile app for symptom mapping for adults with persisting postconcussion symptoms and investigate its usability, feasibility, and safety. This was a mixed method development and usability study consisting of three iterative cycles, each including (1) app design and programming, (2) app usability evaluation by the user group, and (3) app review by the clinician group. The outcomes were the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire and Mobile App Rating Scale scores, the number of days with logged symptom data during a home-testing period, and descriptions of adverse events throughout the study period. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore the user group's experiences further. Twenty-three adults with persisting postconcussion symptoms (median age 52, IQR 34-59 years; 70% female) were included in the user group. Six clinicians (median age 53, IQR 35-60 years), including 3 (50%) females, with a mean of 13 (SD 7) years of experience working with individuals with persisting postconcussion symptoms, were included in the clinician group. The app received a mean score of 5 (SD 1.1) on the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (7-point Likert scale) from the user group and 4.1 (SD 0.4) on the Mobile App Rating Scale (5-point Likert Scale) from the clinician group. During the 28-day home-testing period, the adherence rate among the participants in the user group was 89% (IQR 78-96), and two adverse events related to increased symptom awareness were registered. Three themes were created through reflexive thematic analysis of the qualitative data: (1) Visualizing the invisible-Enabling reflection and insight; (2) Personalized yet simple-Balancing relevance and usefulness; and (3) More than just a number-The complexity behind the symptom scores. We developed a research-based symptom mapping app for people with persisting postconcussion symptoms. The app received high usability ratings from both the user and clinician groups. The app is a feasible alternative to traditional symptom mapping methods, and it is safe to use for its intended purpose.

[PMID: 41187261] Human-centered design (HCD) is vital for crafting impactful and successful health interventions. This approach has been effective in enhancing the uptake of health services, especially in rural areas. The Routine Immunization Buddy System (RIBS) is an HCD-driven intervention designed to support economically disadvantaged caregivers by empowering them to take greater responsibility for their own health and the immunization of their children. Through a community-based participatory research (CBPR), this study seeks to understand the economic, social, and health lifestyles and the impact on the health-seeking attributes of the potential beneficiaries of the project. This ensures that the identified intervention and its strategy will be implemented in a way that is of utmost benefit to the users. Using a 3-step HCD process-discovery, ideation, and formulation-the study conducted focus group discussions and key informant interviews for caregivers and stakeholders capable of influencing the woman's decision within a health setting. Semistructured interviews facilitated an in-depth exploration of participants' experiences. Data collection used audio and video recordings, detailed notes, and observation sessions. Data analysis encompassed transcription, descriptive analysis, and thematic analysis to inform evidence-based interventions. Four key interconnected barriers to routine immunization were identified from the formative research: (1) vaccine hesitancy, which is driven by safety concerns and inconsistency in vaccine-related messaging; (2) gender-based decision-making constraints, where male approval often influenced access to care; (3) financial limitations affecting transport and medical costs; and (4) unequal access to health care due to geographic disparities. Caregivers emphasized the need for economic empowerment and trusted community-based health education. These findings informed a critical redesign of the intervention from a 2-arm to a 3-arm model, with peer support groups and financial empowerment components added to address both economic barriers and vaccine misinformation through culturally tailored approaches. The use of HCD-informed formative research has helped identify tailored women's empowerment strategies, such as economic support, community-led advocacy, and peer networks, that show promise in addressing health disparities among caregivers. These approaches are hoped to enhance caregivers' ability to make informed health decisions, ultimately contributing to improved immunization uptake and broader community well-being. The insights from this research are actively informing the design of our upcoming cluster randomized controlled trial, which aims to strengthen women's decision-making power around immunization services.

[PMID: 41187251] Paralytic ileus is a frequent complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), contributing to increased morbidity, nutritional compromise, and risk of infection. Despite its clinical relevance, data on its incidence, predictors, management, and outcomes in AP remain limited. We conducted a retrospective study of 426 adult patients admitted with AP over a 3-year period at a tertiary-care center. The primary outcome was paralytic ileus; secondary outcomes included infected necrosis, intervention, and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors expressed as adjusted odds ratio (aOR). Paralytic ileus occurred in 167/426 (39.2%) patients. Patients with ileus were more frequently male, obese, and had higher rates of SIRS compared to those without ileus. They also exhibited significantly higher leukocyte counts, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), serum creatinine, and lower serum albumin and sodium levels. In multivariate analysis, obesity (aOR: 2.329), NLR (aOR: 1.131), serum albumin (aOR: 0.342), and serum sodium (aOR: 0.802) were identified as independent predictors. An NLR of 9.5 had a sensitivity of 82.6% and a specificity of 76.1% for predicting paralytic ileus. Conservative management resolved ileus in 85% of cases, 6% responded to neostigmine, while 9% with unresolved ileus succumbed to multiorgan failure. Paralytic ileus was independently associated with increased risk of infected necrosis (aOR: 3.62), intervention (aOR: 4.43), and mortality (aOR: 4.71). Paralytic ileus affects a significant proportion of patients with moderate to severe AP and is a marker of local and systemic complications. Paralytic ileus was an independent predictor of infected necrosis, intervention, and mortality, underscoring its prognostic relevance.

[PMID: 41187231] The only approved triple-combination acne treatment &ndash; clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/adapalene 0.15%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1% (CAB) gel - demonstrated efficacy/safety in 12-week clinical trials. However, real-world treatment may require 6 months for maximum benefits in some cases. Since long-term antibiotic use can lead to resistance in the causative Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes), this analysis evaluated the effect of long-term CAB use on C. acnes. Pooled data from 2 identical, 24-week, single-center, open-label studies evaluated once-daily CAB in participants aged &ge;12 years with moderate/severe acne (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] of 3/4). Plates inoculated with central forehead swabs were monitored for C. acnes colony formation. Clindamycin susceptibility was assessed via minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values using Epsilometer tests; MIC &ge;8 &mu;g/mL indicated resistance. Of 50 participants enrolled, 45 completed the studies. At baseline, C. acnes strains were isolated from 82% (37/45) of participants. After 24 weeks, CAB-treated participants with cultivable isolates decreased by nearly half to 44% (20/45). For susceptible strains isolated at week 24, MIC values remained low (mean, 0.19 &mu;g/mL). Only 1 participant without growth at baseline had cultivable C. acnes at week 24, deemed clindamycin-susceptible. Only the 5 participants (11%) with resistant C. acnes isolates at baseline had resistant isolates at study end, though all 5 had acne improvements at week 24 (IGA decrease, 1-3 points; lesion reductions, 40%-100%). Long-term CAB gel treatment did not lead to antibiotic resistance development and was efficacious in participants with resistant isolates at baseline, suggesting CAB is well suited for long-term acne treatment.",10
Men are more susceptible to death due to pneumonia when compared to women.,pneumonia mortality AND gender differences AND sex differences AND men vs women,"40603223,39900042,39449074,38551022,38307502,38017259,37986157,37769748,37651422,37434312","[PMID: 40603223] To explore differences between sexes in the prognosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia. We analysed consecutive patients admitted to 27 intensive care units (ICU) from nine European countries and included in the EU-VAP/CAP cohort. All were mechanically ventilated for severe CAP. Sex was obtained from the medical records. Sexes were compared according to age, severity of illness, chronic health condition, co-morbidities, use of diagnostic procedures, length of mechanical ventilation, stay in the ICU, initial antibiotic treatment, and pathogens. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. We tested in a multivariate logistic regression the association of sex with mortality. We included 257 patients (32 % women; mean age 60.5 years). Mean SAPS II score was 48.6 and 125 patients (50.6 %) were in septic shock, without difference between sexes. Women had more frequently a McCabe score of 0 (61 % vs. 51 % of men, p = 0.13). Bronchoscopy was performed in 39 % of men and 26 % of women (p = 0.04). Antibiotic treatment did not differ between sexes. A pathogen was identified in 47 % of patients. 101 patients (39.3 %) died: 35 % of men and 48 % of women (OR 0.59, 95 % CI 0.34-1.00). Male sex was associated with lower mortality (OR 0.42, 95 % CI 0.21-0.84) after adjusting for age, SAPS II score, McCabe score, and use of bronchoscopy. Women mechanically ventilated at the ICU for severe CAP had higher mortality despite similar severity of disease and better chronic health. Bronchoscopy was performed more frequently in men suggesting differences in management between sexes.

[PMID: 39900042] SARS-CoV-2 can cause mild upper respiratory tract involvement to pulmonary disease of varying severity, as well as cardiovascular complications with increased mortality. The prevalence is similar in men and women, although there are sex differences in disease characteristics and outcome. In this study, we analyze the clinical characteristics, progression, and in-hospital outcome by sex of patients included in the RACCOVID-19 registry. We included data from 2750 patients consecutively admitted to 50 centers in 11 provinces of the country, from May 18 to October 31, 2020. A total of 1541 men (60.2%) and 1018 women (39.8%) were included (p<0.001). The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (because of current smoking) was higher in men. During hospitalization, men had a higher incidence of cardiovascular complications (17.9% vs. 12.5%; p=0.0002) and mortality (20.8% vs. 16.8%; p=0.01). Poor performance status on hospital admission was more common in men (53.9% vs. 42.6%, p<0.0001). On multivariate analysis, male sex, the presence of hypertension and diabetes, and a history of other medical conditions were independent predictors of inhospital mortality. In the RACCOVID-19 registry, men had worse performance status and higher incidence of cardiovascular complications with higher in-hospital mortality. Male sex, hypertension, diabetes, and history of other diseases were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.

[PMID: 39449074] Male sex has been identified as a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcomes. This sex difference has been mostly attributed to the complex role of sex hormones. Cell surface entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which is under transcriptional regulation by androgens. P450 aromatase enzyme converts androgens to estrogens. This study measured concentrations of aromatase enzyme, testosterone, estradiol, and TMPRSS-2 in plasma of hospitalized COVID-19 patients to elucidate the dynamics of sex-linked disparity in COVID-19 and correlate them with disease severity and mortality. In this prospective cohort study, a total of 265 patients (41% women), age 18 years and older, who had a positive COVID-19 PCR test and were hospitalized for COVID-19 at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, (between May 2020 and May 2021) were enrolled in the study if met inclusion criteria. Plasma concentrations of Testosterone, aromatase, TMPRSS-2, and estradiol were measured by ELISA. COVID-19 patients were dichotomized based on disease severity into moderate-severe (n = 146) or critical (n = 119). Mann Whitney U and logistic regression were used to correlate the analytes with disease severity and mortality. TMPRSS2 (2.5 ± 0.31 vs. 1.73 ± 0.21 ng/mL, p < 0.01) and testosterone (1.2 ± 0.1 vs. 0.44 ± 0.12 ng/mL, p < 0.01) were significantly higher in men as compared to women with COVID-19 after adjusting for age in a multivariate model. There was no sex difference seen in the level of estradiol and aromatase in COVID-19 patients. TMPRSS2 and aromatase were higher, while testosterone was lower in patients with increased COVID-19 severity. They were independently associated with COVID-19 severity, after adjusting for several baseline risk factors in a multivariate logistic regression model. In terms of mortality, TMPRRS2 and aromatase levels were significantly higher in non-survivors. Our study demonstrates that testosterone, aromatase, and TMPRSS2 are markers of COVID-19 severity. Estradiol levels do not change with disease severity in COVID-19. In terms of mortality prediction, higher aromatase and TMPRSS-2 levels can be used to predict mortality from COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. COVID-19 has caused over a million deaths in the U.S., with men often getting sicker than women. Testosterone, a male hormone, helps control a protein called TMPRSS-2, which allows the COVID-19 virus to spread more easily in the body. A protein called aromatase converts the male hormone testosterone into the female hormone estrogen. It is thought that female hormone estrogen helps protect women from getting seriously ill from COVID-19. To understand the role of these hormones in COVID-19 and sex differences, we measured levels of testosterone, estrogen, aromatase (which turns testosterone into estrogen), and TMPRSS-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We also checked how this level might reflect the severity of the disease. We found that critically ill COVID-19 patients (the ones in ICU) had higher levels of TMPRSS-2 and aromatase, and lower testosterone levels. When we used these hormone levels to predict death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, higher levels of TMPRSS-2 and aromatase were linked to a lower chance of survival.

[PMID: 38551022] Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare neurovascular condition that has been observed in individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This systematic review aimed to explore the sex differences and characteristics of concurrent COVID-19 and CVST cases. A total of 212 CVST patients were included in the study. Women with CVST had a slightly higher mean age compared to men (47.359 years vs 46.08 years). Women were more likely to report symptoms such as fever (56.1%) and decreased sense of smell or taste (71.4%), while men more frequently experienced nausea or vomiting (55.6%), headache (62.9%), and seizures (72%). Notably, current smokers, who were predominantly men, had a higher occurrence of CVST. On the other hand, women had a higher likelihood of CVST risk factors such as oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use and autoimmune diseases. Treatment approaches also showed sex-based differences. Unfractionated heparin was administered more often to women with CVST (63.2%). The in-hospital mortality rate for CVST patients was 21.3%, with men having a significantly higher mortality rate than women (65.2% vs 34.8%, <i>P</i> = .027). Survival analysis revealed that factors such as smoking history, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, OCP use, COVID-19 symptoms, CVST symptoms, and the need for intubation significantly influenced survival outcomes. Understanding these sex differences in COVID-19-related CVST is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex as a factor in the evaluation and treatment of individuals with COVID-19 and concurrent CVST.

[PMID: 38307502] Many epidemiological studies have shown that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects males, compared with females, although other studies show that there were no such differences. The aim of the present study was to assess differences in the prevalence of hospitalizations and in-hospital outcomes between the sexes, using a larger administrative database. We used the 2020 California State Inpatient Database for this retrospective analysis. <i>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> diagnosis code U07.1 was used to identify COVID-19 hospitalizations. These hospitalizations were subsequently stratified by male and female sex. Diagnosis and procedures were identified using the <i>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> codes. The primary outcome of the study was hospitalization rate, and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. There were 95,180 COVID-19 hospitalizations among patients 18 years and older, 52,465 (55.1%) of which were among men and 42,715 (44.9%) were among women. In-hospital mortality (12.4% vs 10.1%), prolonged length of hospital stays (30.6% vs 25.8%), vasopressor use (2.6% vs 1.6%), mechanical ventilation (11.8% vs 8.0%), and ICU admission rates (11.4% versus 7.8%) were significantly higher among male compared with female hospitalizations. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-1.44), hospital lengths of stay (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.31-1.39), vasopressor use (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.51-1.66), mechanical ventilation (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.47-1.78), and ICU admission rates (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.51-1.66) were significantly higher among male hospitalizations. Our findings show that male sex is an independent and strong risk factor associated with COVID-19 severity.

[PMID: 38017259] To research the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, the prevalence and characteristics of all completed suicides in the city of Frankfurt am Main were compared for a 10-month period before the pandemic (March 2019-December 2019) with one during the early pandemic (March 2020-December 2020). Medicolegal data collected in the context of the FraPPE suicide prevention project were evaluated using descriptive statistical methods. In total, there were 81 suicides during the early pandemic period, as opposed to 86 in the pre-pandemic period. Though statistically not significant, the proportion of male suicides (73%) was higher during the early pandemic period than before (63%). The age-at-death was comparable in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods (average, 54.8 vs. 53.1 years). Between these two periods, there was no difference in respect to the three most commonly used suicide methods by men: fall from a height (26% vs. 22%), intoxication, and strangulation (each 24% vs. 19%). For women, there was, however, a shift in methods from strangulation (38%), intoxication (28%), and fall from a height (19%) to fall from a height (50%), strangulation (18%), intoxication, and collision with a rail vehicle (14% each). There was a trend towards more suicides among non-German nationals during the early pandemic (suicide rate/100,000 inhabitants: German, 14.3 vs. 11.5; non-German, 4.4 vs. 8.8). Before the pandemic, 54% of the suicides were known to have a mental illness in contrast to 44% during the early pandemic. Overall, no increase in completed suicides could be observed in Frankfurt am Main during the early pandemic.

[PMID: 37986157] COVID-19 infections are associated with accrued inflammatory responses which may result in cardiac injury. Immune response to infection appears different between men and women, suggesting that COVID-19 patients' outcomes may differ according to biological sex. However, the impact of biological sex on the occurrence of cardiac injury during intensive care unit (ICU) stay in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this multicenter and prospective study, we included consecutive patients admitted to ICU for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, during the first two pandemic waves. Biological, electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiographic variables were collected on ICU admission. Cardiac injury was defined by increased troponin above 99th percentile of upper norm value and newly diagnosed ECG and/or echocardiographic abnormalities. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with cardiac injury during ICU stay according to biological sex. The impact of biological sex on other subsequent clinical outcomes was also evaluated. We included 198 patients with a median age of 66 (56-73) years, 147 (74%) patients were men and 51 (26%) were women. Overall, 119 (60%) patients had cardiac injury during ICU stay and the proportion of patients with cardiac injury during ICU stay was not different between men and women (60% vs. 61%, p = 1.00). Patients with cardiac injury during ICU stay showed more cardiovascular risk factors and chronic cardiac disease and had a higher ICU mortality rate. On ICU admission, they had a more marked lymphopenia (0.70 (0.40-0.80) vs. 0.80 (0.50-1.10) × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, p < 0.01) and inflammation (C-Reactive Protein (155 (88-246) vs. 111 (62-192) mg/L, p = 0.03); D-Dimers (1293 (709-2523) vs. 900 (560-1813) µg/L, p = 0.03)). Plasmatic levels of inflammatory biomarkers on ICU admission correlated with SAPS-2 and SOFA scores but not with the different echocardiographic variables. Multivariate analysis confirmed cardiovascular risk factors (OR = 2.31; 95%CI (1.06-5.02), p = 0.03) and chronic cardiac disease (OR = 8.58; 95%CI (1.01-73.17), p = 0.04) were independently associated with the occurrence of cardiac injury during ICU stay, whereas biological sex (OR = 0.88; 95%CI (0.42-1.84), p = 0.73) was not. Biological sex had no impact on the occurrence during ICU stay of other clinical outcomes. Most critically ill patients with COVID-19 were men and experienced cardiac injury during ICU stay. Nevertheless, biological sex had no impact on the occurrence of cardiac injury during ICU stay or on other clinical outcomes. Clinical trial registration NCT04335162.

[PMID: 37769748] To investigate the association between nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (NMV-r) and the outcomes of non-hospitalized obese patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX research network to identify non-hospitalized obese adult patients with COVID-19 between 1 January 2022 and 30 June 2023. Propensity score matching was used to match patients receiving NMV-r (NMV-r group) with those not receiving NMV-r (control group). The primary outcome was the compositive outcome of all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization or death during the 30-day follow-up period. Using propensity score matching methods, two cohorts of 30,969 patients each with balanced baseline characteristics were identified. During the follow-up period, the NMV-r group had a lower risk of all-cause ED visits, hospitalization or death [4.80% (n=1489) vs 5.50% (n=1705); hazard ratio (HR) 0.900, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.839-0.965]. Compared with the control group, the NMV-r group had a lower risk of all-cause ED visits (HR 0.812, 95% CI 0.740-0.891) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.089, 95% CI 0.027-0.288). The lower risk in the NMV-r group compared with the control group was observed consistently in most subgroup analyses according to body mass index (30.0-34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.82; 35.0-39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52-0.87), age (4-64 years: HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92; ≥65 years: HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98), sex (men: HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.79; women: HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.63-0.76) and vaccination status (unvaccinated: HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.70-0.81). NMV-r is associated with reduced risk of all-cause ED visits, hospitalization and death for non-hospitalized obese patients with COVID-19. Accordingly, these findings support the use of NMV-r in obese patients.

[PMID: 37651422] COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minorities compared to White people. Studies have not sufficiently examined how sex and age interact with race/ethnicity, and potentially shape COVID-19 outcomes. We sought to examine disparities in COVID-19 outcomes by race, sex and age over time, leveraging data from Michigan, the only state whose Department of Health and Human Services (DHSS) publishes cross-sectional race, sex and age data on COVID-19. This is an observational study using publicly available COVID-19 data (weekly cases, deaths, and vaccinations) from August 31 2020 to June 9 2021. Outcomes for descriptive analysis were age-standardized COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates, case-fatality rates by race, sex, and age, and within-gender and within-race incidence rate ratios and mortality rate ratios. We used descriptive statistics and linear regressions with age, race, and sex as independent variables. The within-sex Black-White racial gap in COVID-19 incidence and mortality decreased at a similar rate among men and women but the remained wider among men. As of June 2021, compared to White people, incidence was lower among Asian American and Pacific Islander people by 2644 cases per 100,000 people and higher among Black people by 1464 cases per 100,000 people. Mortality was higher among those aged 60 or greater by 743.6 deaths per 100,000 people vs those 0-39. The interaction between race and age was significant between Black race and age 60 or greater, with an additional 708.5 deaths per 100,000 people vs White people aged 60 or greater. Black people had a higher case fatality rate than White people. COVID-19 incidence, mortality and vaccination patterns varied over time by race, age and sex. Black-White disparities decreased over time, with a larger effect on Black men, and Older Black people were particularly more vulnerable to COVID-19 in terms of mortality. Considering different individual characteristics such as age may further help elucidate the mechanisms behind racial and gender health disparities.

[PMID: 37434312] Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (CVST-VITT) is a severe disease with high mortality. There are few data on sex differences in CVST-VITT. The aim of our study was to investigate the differences in presentation, treatment, clinical course, complications, and outcome of CVST-VITT between women and men. We used data from an ongoing international registry on CVST-VITT. VITT was diagnosed according to the Pavord criteria. We compared the characteristics of CVST-VITT in women and men. Of 133 patients with possible, probable, or definite CVST-VITT, 102 (77%) were women. Women were slightly younger [median age 42 (IQR 28-54) vs 45 (28-56)], presented more often with coma (26% vs 10%) and had a lower platelet count at presentation [median (IQR) 50x10<sup>9</sup>/L (28-79) vs 68 (30-125)] than men. The nadir platelet count was lower in women [median (IQR) 34 (19-62) vs 53 (20-92)]. More women received endovascular treatment than men (15% vs 6%). Rates of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins were similar (63% vs 66%), as were new venous thromboembolic events (14% vs 14%) and major bleeding complications (30% vs 20%). Rates of good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2, 42% vs 45%) and in-hospital death (39% vs 41%) did not differ. Three quarters of CVST-VITT patients in this study were women. Women were more severely affected at presentation, but clinical course and outcome did not differ between women and men. VITT-specific treatments were overall similar, but more women received endovascular treatment.",10
Metastatic colorectal cancer treated with a single agent fluoropyrimidines resulted in similar efficacy and better quality of life when compared with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in elderly patients.,Metastatic colorectal cancer AND fluoropyrimidines AND oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy AND elderly patients,"40155030,39552190,38653648,32850329,30720091,29346573,28730771,27155924,26141683,26053280","[PMID: 40155030] Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed malignancy worldwide. The efficacy of first-line chemotherapy for metastatic CRC with early recurrence after adjuvant therapy remains unclear; therefore, this study investigated its impact. A retrospective evaluation was conducted on patients with early recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy from three institutions between 2016 and 2021. Early recurrence was defined as recurrence during or within 1 year of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. Progression-free and overall survival, as well as the overall response rate, were endpoints, with analysis stratified by a recurrence-free interval (RFI) of 6 months. Data from 455 patients treated with adjuvant therapy were reviewed, identifying 32 eligible patients. Twenty-eight patients (88%) received oxaliplatin-containing regimens, and four (12%) received fluoropyrimidine monotherapy. For palliative chemotherapy, oxaliplatin-based, irinotecan-based, or other regimens were administered to 13 (41%), 13 (41%), and 6 (18%) patients, respectively. Median progression-free and overall survival were 10.4 and 43.0 months, respectively. The overall response rate was 34.4%, and the disease control rate was 75.0%. Patients with RFI <6 months had a lower response rate (26% <i>vs</i>. 56%), shorter progression-free survival (10.4 <i>vs</i>. 17.8 months), and shorter overall survival (31.3 <i>vs</i>. 43.0 months); however, these differences were not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis suggested worse overall survival for patients with RFI <6 months than for those with RFI ≥6 months (hazard ratio=1.78, 95% confidence interval=0.35-8.98; <i>p</i>=0.49). Patients with CRC and RFI <6 months after adjuvant chemotherapy showed a trend toward poorer outcomes than those with RFI ≥6 months, suggesting a need for more intensive treatment strategies.

[PMID: 39552190] Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a powerful measure of minimal residual disease (MRD) in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although immunotherapy has been widely established in metastatic CRC that is mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H), its role in non-metastatic CRC is rapidly evolving. In resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage II CRC, adjuvant fluoropyrimidine has no benefit and is not recommended. There is growing evidence to suggest diminished benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation in localized CRC that is dMMR/MSI-H. We present two cases of dMMR/MSI-H stage III CRC treated with definitive surgery wherein adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy led to a failure to clear postoperative plasma ctDNA levels, prompting a change to immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab and resultant ctDNA clearance. We illustrate that chemotherapy may achieve suboptimal disease control in localized colon cancer that is dMMR/MSI-H, while plasma ctDNA offers a window of opportunity to gauge the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy to clear microscopic disease in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer. These findings are important to contextualize given that relapse is inevitable with failure to clear MRD in the postoperative stage I-III CRC setting whereby chemotherapy remains the standard adjuvant therapy in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer.

[PMID: 38653648] Cohorts A, C, and E of the phase Ib KEYNOTE-651 study evaluated pembrolizumab + binimetinib ± chemotherapy in microsatellite stable/mismatch repair-proficient metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks plus binimetinib 30 mg twice daily alone (cohort A; previously treated with any chemotherapy) or with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (cohort C; previously untreated) or 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan (cohort E; previously treated with 1 line of therapy including fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin-based regimen) every 2 weeks. Binimetinib dose-escalation to 45 mg twice daily was planned in all cohorts using a modified toxicity probability interval design (target dose-limiting toxicity [DLT], 30%). The primary endpoint was safety; investigator-assessed objective response rate was secondary. In cohort A, 1/6 patients (17%) had DLTs with binimetinib 30 mg; none occurred in 14 patients with 45 mg. In cohort C, 3/9 patients (33%) had DLTs with binimetinib 30 mg; dose was not escalated to 45 mg. In cohort E, 1/5 patients (20%) had DLTs with binimetinib 30 mg; 5/10 patients (50%) had DLTs with 45 mg. Enrollment was stopped in cohort E binimetinib 45 mg and deescalated to 30 mg; 2/4 additional patients (50%) had DLTs with binimetinib 30 mg (total 3/9 [33%] had DLTs with binimetinib 30 mg). Objective response rate was 0% in cohort A, 9% in cohort C, and 15% in cohort E. Per DLT criteria, binimetinib + pembrolizumab (cohort A) was tolerable, binimetinib + pembrolizumab + 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (cohort C) did not qualify for binimetinib dose escalation to 45 mg, and binimetinib + pembrolizumab + 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan (cohort E) required binimetinib dose reduction from 45 to 30 mg. No new safety findings were observed across cohorts. There was no apparent additive efficacy when binimetinib + pembrolizumab was added to chemotherapy. Data did not support continued enrollment in cohorts C and E.

[PMID: 32850329] <b>Introduction:</b> Intensive oncological treatment integrated with resection of metastases raised the clinical outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). In clinical practice, complex evaluation of clinical (age, performance status, comorbidities), and biological (tumoral genotype, pharmacogenomic) parameters addresses tailored, personalized multidisciplinary treatment strategies. Patients with MCRC unsuitable for first-line intensive medical treatments are prevalent and showed worse clinical outcome. After progression to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, aflibercept/FOLFIRI significantly improved clinical outcome, even if no survival benefit was reported in adjuvant fast relapsers by aflibercept addition. The case reported a young-elderly (yE) patient with <i>KRAS</i> mutant colorectal cancer rapidly progressing to adjuvant chemotherapy, unfit owing to comorbidities, with multiple pharmacogenomic alterations, who gained long-term survival in clinical practice by multidisciplinary treatment strategy consisting of first-line and re-introduction of aflibercept-containing chemotherapy and two-stage lung metastasectomies. <b>Case presentation:</b> A 71-years-old yE patient, unfit for intensive oncological treatments owing to Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) stage secondary, affected by <i>KRAS</i> c.35 G>T mutant colorectal cancer, rapidly progressing with lung metastases after adjuvant XelOx chemotherapy, reached long-term survival 66 months with no evidence of disease after first-line and re-introduction of tailored, modulated aflibercept (4 mg/kg) d1,15-irinotecan (120 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) d1,15-5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) dd1-4, 15-18; and secondary radical bilateral two-stage lung metastasectomies. Safety profile was characterized by limiting toxicity syndrome at multiple sites (LTS-ms), requiring 5-fluorouracil discontinuation and aflibercept reduction (2 mg/kg), because of G2 hand-foot syndrome (HFS) for >2 weeks, and G3 hypertension. Pharmacogenomic analyses revealed multiple alterations of fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan metabolism: severe deficiency of fluorouracil degradation rate (FUDR), single nucleotide polymorphisms of <i>UGT1A1</i> <sup>*</sup>28 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) 7R/7R homozygote, <i>ABCB1</i> c.C3435T, c.C1236T, <i>MTHFR</i> c.C667T homozygote, <i>DPYD</i> c.A166G, <i>TSER</i> 28bp VNTR 2R/3R heterozygote. <b>Conclusions:</b> In clinical practice, a complex management evaluating clinical parameters and <i>RAS</i>/<i>BRAF</i> genotype characterizing an individual patient with MCRC, particularly elderly and/or unfit owing to comorbidities, is required to properly address tailored, multidisciplinary medical and surgical treatment strategies, integrated with careful monitoring of superimposing toxicity syndromes, also related to pharmacogenomic alterations, to gain optimal activity, and long-term efficacy.

[PMID: 30720091] Aflibercept in combination with 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU)/irinotecan improves overall survival in the second‑line therapy of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In this study, we evaluated the effects of aflibercept in first‑line therapy with FOLFOX followed by maintenance with fluoropyrimidine. VELVET was a prospective, single‑arm multicenter phase II study (completed). Patients with previously untreated, unresectable, evaluable or measurable mCRC, with an age ≥18 years, and an ECOG performance status of 0‑2 received 6 cycles of modified FOLFOX7 (5‑FU/folinic acid and oxaliplatin) with aflibercept at 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks followed by maintenance therapy with fluoropyrimidine with aflibercept until disease progression or limiting toxicity. The reintroduction of oxaliplatin was performed at first progression. The primary endpoint was progression‑free survival (PFS) at 6 months. From May, 2013 to May, 2014, 49 patients were included and 48 were evaluable for response. In total, 33 patients (67.4%) were alive without progression at 6 months. The Kaplan‑Meier survival 6‑month and 1‑year PFS rates were 79.1 and 36.1%, respectively, and the median PFS was 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.3‑12.5). The objective response rate was 59.2% (N=29/49). The most common (≥10%) grade 3‑4 adverse events were hypertension (23%), fatigue (15%), neutropenia (12%), neuropathy (12%) and stomatitis (10%). Three (6%) treatment‑related deaths occurred: One from stroke, one from pulmonary embolism and one from neutropenic sepsis. On the whole, this study demonstrates the efficacy of aflibercept in combination with an oxaliplatin‑based regimen in the first‑line therapy of patients with mCRC. A strict monitoring of blood pressure and immediate management of hypertension during therapy is mandatory.

[PMID: 29346573] Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy can cause hepatic sinusoidal injury (HSI), portal hypertension, and splenic sequestration of platelets. Evidence suggests that bevacizumab may protect against HSI. Two cohorts of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) were analyzed: a nonrandomized exploratory cohort of 184 patients treated at a single institution from 2003 to 2010 and a confirmatory cohort of 200 patients from a multi-institutional randomized trial (NO16966). All patients were treated with frontline fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab. Changes in splenic volumes and platelet counts were compared by treatment, two-sided log-rank test. In the exploratory cohort, the bevacizumab-treated patients (n = 138) compared with the nonbevacizumab-treated patients (n = 46) demonstrated a longer median time to splenic enlargement (≥30%, P = .02) and reduced rate of thrombocytopenia (<150 000/mm3, P = .04). In the confirmatory cohort (106 bevacizumab arm and 94 placebo arm), the median time to a spleen enlargement of 30% or more was 7.6 vs 5.4 (P = .01), and six-month cumulative incidence of thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 000/mm3) was 19% vs 51% (P < .001) for bevacizumab compared with placebo. The development of an increasing spleen size was associated with the risk of either grade 1 or grade 2 thrombocytopenia (P < .001). The cumulative rate of grade 1 or grade 2 thrombocytopenia was statistically less in the bevacizumab arm, with six-month grade 2 thrombocytopenia rates of 4% vs 23% (P < .001). Patients with a large spleen prior to chemotherapy initiation appeared to be at highest risk of this toxicity. In metastatic CRC, the addition of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy reduces the frequency of splenic enlargement and the rate of thrombocytopenia.

[PMID: 28730771] To assess prognostic/predictive value of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), transthyretin (TRT), αenolase (NNE), β2-microglobulin (β2-micro), B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. 72 histologically confirmed mCRC patients treated at Oncology Institute Cluj were included. Biomarker levels were measured through validated methods. A manual method was used for CTCs, involving hemolysis, cytospin centrifugation and immunocytochemical staining for pan-cytokeratin. Statistical endpoints were response, progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Initial chemotherapy was fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin-based in 93.1%; bevacizumab was added in 58.3% of the patients. Median PFS and OS were 16.4 and 24.4 months. Two-year OS for CR & PR vs SD vs PD were 90% vs 48% vs 12%, respectively (p<0.01). Two-year OS for chemo/ bevacizumab vs chemotherapy: 65% vs 42% (p=0.09). Baseline CEA ≥5 ng/ml had a negative prognostic impact on OS and PFS (p<0.01). High baseline CEA was predictive of improved OS when adding bevacizumab (2-year OS chemo/bevacizumab vs chemo: 60% vs 17%, p<0.01); adding bevacizumab in patients with normal CEA did not improve OS (p=0.29). Higher than cut-off values for TRT had a positive OS prognostic value (p<0.01); higher levels for NNE, β2-microglobulin and BAFF had a negative impact (p<0.01). Two-year OS for baseline <1 CTC/ml vs ≥1 CTC/ ml was 74% vs 64% respectively (p=0.15). The evaluated biomarkers could be useful prognostic factors for survival. Baseline CEA also has predictive value, suggesting that patients with low levels do not benefit from bevacizumab. A non-statistically significant correlation was observed between the number of CTCs and outcome.

[PMID: 27155924] The identification of RAS status (KRAS and NRAS) has changed the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The impact of the RAS mutation on cytotoxic chemotherapy efficacy has not yet been determined. Nevertheless, several retrospective studies suggest a greater efficacy of oxaliplatin in mCRC with KRAS mutation. We analyzed retrospectively the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in 216 patients with mCRC receiving first line treatment between 2008 and 2010 according to KRAS status and chemotherapy regimen used (oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based, in association with fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab). In KRAS mutated tumors, median OS was 23.4 months with oxaliplatin-based regimen, and 23.6 months with irinotecan-based regimen, with no significant difference (HR 1.30; 95 % CI 0.81-2.09; P=0.27). In KRAS wild-type tumors, median OS was 30.3 months with oxaliplatin-based regimen, and 25.4 months with irinotecan-based regimen, with no significant difference (HR 0.81; 95 % CI 0.52-1.24; P=0.33). Similarly, KRAS mutational status had no significant effect on efficacy of oxaliplatin or irinotecan regarding PFS. In this retrospective study, KRAS mutational status does not influence the efficacy of first line cytotoxic chemotherapy in association with bevacizumab.

[PMID: 26141683] The management of unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a comprehensive treatment strategy involving several lines of therapy, maintenance, salvage surgery, and treatment-free intervals. Besides chemotherapy (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan), molecular-targeted agents such as anti-angiogenic agents (bevacizumab, aflibercept, regorafenib) and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor agents (cetuximab, panitumumab) have become available. Ultimately, given the increasing cost of new active compounds, new strategy trials are needed to define the optimal use and the best sequencing of these agents. Such new clinical trials require alternative endpoints that can capture the effect of several treatment lines and be measured earlier than overall survival to help shorten the duration and reduce the size and cost of trials. STRATEGIC-1 is an international, open-label, randomized, multicenter phase III trial designed to determine an optimally personalized treatment sequence of the available treatment modalities in patients with unresectable RAS wild-type mCRC. Two standard treatment strategies are compared: first-line FOLFIRI-cetuximab, followed by oxaliplatin-based second-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab (Arm A) vs. first-line OPTIMOX-bevacizumab, followed by irinotecan-based second-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab, and by an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody with or without irinotecan as third-line treatment (Arm B). The primary endpoint is duration of disease control. A total of 500 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment strategies. The STRATEGIC-1 trial is designed to give global information on the therapeutic sequences in patients with unresectable RAS wild-type mCRC that in turn is likely to have a significant impact on the management of this patient population. The trial is open for inclusion since August 2013. STRATEGIC-1 is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01910610, 23 July, 2013. STRATEGIC-1 is registered at EudraCT-No.: 2013-001928-19, 25 April, 2013.

[PMID: 26053280] Panitumumab has proven efficacy in patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal cancer patients, provided that they have no activating KRAS mutation in their tumour. Simvastatin blocks the mevalonate pathway and thereby interferes with the post-translational modification of KRAS. We hypothesize that the activity of the RAS-induced pathway in patients with a KRAS mutation might be inhibited by simvastatin. This would theoretically result in increased sensitivity to panitumumab, potentially comparable with tumours with wild-type KRAS. A Simon two-stage design single-arm, phase II study was designed to test the safety and efficacy of the addition of simvastatin to panitumumab in colorectal cancer patients with a KRAS mutation after failing fluoropyrimidine-based, oxaliplatin-based and irinotecan-based therapy. The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients alive and free from progression 11 weeks after the first administration of panitumumab, aiming for at least 40%, which is comparable with, although slightly lower than, that in KRAS wild-type patients in this setting. If this 40% was reached, then the study would continue into the second step up to 46 patients. Explorative correlative analysis for mutations in the KRAS and related pathways was carried out. One of 14 patients was free from progression at the primary endpoint time. The median progression-free survival was 8.4 weeks and the median overall survival status was 19.6 weeks. We conclude that the concept of mutant KRAS phenotype expression modulation with simvastatin was not applicable in the clinic.",10

Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41187220] The glycocalyx is a proteoglycan-rich layer present on the surface of all mammalian cells and is particularly prevalent on endothelial cells lining the vasculature. The glycocalyx is thought to affect leukocyte migration by masking adhesion molecules and reducing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Leukocyte recruitment is a key driver of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Here, we found that leukocytes had the glycocalyx component heparan sulfate on their cell surface and that it was lost in response to psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In contrast, endothelial heparan sulfate was not affected. Treatment with a heparan sulfate mimetic during psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice protected heparan sulfate from cleavage by myeloid cell-derived heparanase and resulted in reduced leukocyte accumulation in the skin. However, clinical signs of inflammation were increased because of the reduced numbers of T regulatory cells that were recruited. These findings refine our understanding of immune cell recruitment by revealing the presence and function of a heparan sulfate glycocalyx on immune cells and highlight the complex effects of heparanase inhibitors on the immune response in this context.

[PMID: 41187216] Many taxa have independently evolved genetic sex determination where a single gene located on a sex chromosome controls gonadal differentiation. The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex-reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the ""Four Core Genotypes"" model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.

[PMID: 41187208] This study reports the first green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using an aqueous leaf extract of Brownlowia tersa (B. tersa), confirming their formation via UV-Vis spectrophotometry with a peak at 472 nm. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial and neuroprotective activities, particularly for Alzheimer's disease. GC-MS and FT-IR analyses identified phenolics and flavonoids as the capping and reducing agents in the synthesis process. FESEM imaging showed nanoparticles of varied shapes and sizes, while EDX analysis confirmed the presence of silver, oxygen, and carbon. The antimicrobial activity was demonstrated with inhibition zones ranging from 8.5 to 10.5 mm against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 100 and 200 μg/disc, compared to control, deionised water. In antioxidant assays, AgNPs exhibited an IC₅₀ of 1533.448 μg/ml, significantly higher than L-ascorbic acid (IC₅₀: 83.948 μg/ml) and the plant extract (IC₅₀: 254.438 μg/ml), indicating weaker antioxidant properties of AgNPs. The cytotoxicity of the AgNPs was assessed using the brine shrimp lethality test, yielding LC₅₀ value of 13.50 μg/ml, indicating moderate toxicity. Neuropharmacological tests, except the elevated plus maze, on swiss albino mice revealed significant anxiolytic effects (p < 0.05) and enhanced locomotor activity. Molecular docking studies of bioactive compounds from B. tersa leaves with Alzheimer's and bacterial infection-related proteins revealed binding energies from -7.7 to -5.2 kcal/mol, with Benzamide, N-ethyl-N-[(4-ethylaminophenyl) sulfonyl]- and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol showing the strongest affinities. While the results are promising, the study acknowledges challenges in scaling up the synthesis process and emphasises the need for further research into the long-term biological effects and safety of AgNPs. Overall, B. tersa-derived AgNPs show great potential for therapeutic applications in bacterial infections and neurological disorders, but scalability and safety require more investigation.

[PMID: 41187206] Fast skeletal muscle fibers from zebrafish share a number of functional properties with mammalian twitch muscle fibers, making this vertebrate a precious model to investigate the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders. We previously reported that action potentials (APs) from zebrafish fast fibers exhibit low amplitude and require unusually strong negative resting membrane voltage levels to be elicited. In this study, using voltage-clamp and current-clamp techniques, we explored the properties of voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV) responsible for initiation and propagation of AP in isolated adult zebrafish fast skeletal muscle fibers and compared them to mouse fast-twitch muscle fibers using the same experimental conditions. We found that kinetics of activation and inactivation of NaV were faster in zebrafish fibers and, overall, that the voltage-dependence of inactivation was shifted by 25 mV toward negative voltages as compared to mouse fibers, yielding a mean half-inactivation potential of -90 mV. In agreement with these findings, recording of APs at various resting membrane potentials indicated that APs vanished for resting membrane potentials less negative than -80 mV in zebrafish, whereas APs could still be elicited from resting membrane potentials as low as -60 mV in mice. In addition, Ca2+ transients induced by field stimulation were insensitive to Na+ current blockade in zebrafish but not in mouse fibers. Fluorescence labeling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors showed that zebrafish fast fibers were multi-innervated with a mean distance between extra-synaptic sarcolemma and motor endplates of 14 µm, expected to lead to negligible attenuation of depolarization propagated from endplates. Finally, knock out of the two genes encoding pore-forming NaV subunits in zebrafish muscles did not induce any change in locomotion and escape behavior of the animals. Taken together, these data question the role of NaV and the occurrence of APs in zebrafish fast muscle.

[PMID: 41187191] Severe viral and bacterial pneumonia are among the most common causes of death worldwide. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1)'s on methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)-induced severe pneumonia following cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. A young mouse model of severe pneumonia was established using Staphylococcus aureus and CMV. LTBP1 overexpression was induced, and pathological changes in lung tissue were assessed through H&E staining. Serum levels of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and interleukin (IL)-1β, were measured using ELISA. Bacterial load in the lungs was quantified, and protein expression levels of LTBP1, TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad3, and p-Smad3 in lung tissue were analyzed using Western blot. The LTBP1 expression was reduced in the young mouse model of severe pneumonia induced by Staphylococcus aureus after cytomegalovirus reactivation. Overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited lung damage, reduced serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), and decreased bacterial load in the lungs. Additionally, overexpression of LTBP1 inhibited the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. LTBP1 efficiently reduces severe pneumonia by activating the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating this condition.

[PMID: 41187159] Adolescent opioid use in the United States commands attention: millions of twelve- to nineteen-year-olds are exposed to opioids each year by prescription and misuse. Recent findings show that opioids bind not only to canonical opioid receptors but also interact with receptors on immune cells within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The potential for early life opioid exposure to give rise to long-term changes in the neuroimmune system is not fully understood, particularly given the adolescent brain's high susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that adolescent opioid use potentiates physiological and behavioral responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness later in life. To achieve this, we treated adolescent (postnatal day 35-42) male and female C57/BL6 mice with saline or bi-daily escalating doses of morphine for 5 days to model opioid dependence and, in adulthood (postnatal day 60-67), administered saline or a low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) to promote an immune response. Body weight, body surface temperature, and locomotor activity were recorded up to 48 hours after LPS administration. Mice were also tested in the forced swim test 52 hours after LPS administration to assess depressive-like behavior. In contrast to our hypotheses, we found that adolescent morphine exposure had no additive effect on low-dose LPS-induced sickness measures when assessed in adulthood. These data suggest that adolescent opioid exposure may have minimal effects on future immune challenges, although further research is needed to confirm this.

[PMID: 41187108] Sensory processing is dynamically modulated by an animal's behavior and internal states. Growing evidence suggests that such modulation starts from early stages, already at the retina, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Combining pharmacological and chemogenetic tools with single-unit extracellular recordings in awake head-fixed mice, here we identified that the visual responses of retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus were both made weaker and slower by histaminergic projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus. The observed changes in the visual responses were, however, not directly linked with histaminergic modulation of pupil dynamics or locomotion behavior. Instead, our computational modeling analysis suggests that the temporal response modulations arise from changes in the intrinsic properties of the circuit, such as gain modulation via the histamine H1 receptors in the retina. Facilitation of visual processing at low histamine levels may offer an ethological advantage, enabling animals to respond rapidly to visual threats during periods of reduced activity.

[PMID: 41187107] Emerging clinical evidence suggests a link between environmental noise and the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effects of high-decibel noise exposure on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that acute noise exposure induces reversible motor deficits in subacute low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice, a model of presymptomatic early-stage PD, while chronic noise exposure results in irreversible motor deficits and significant loss of substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Additionally, noise exposure activates the inferior colliculus (IC), which sends monosynaptic projections to SNcDA neurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic bidirectional activation or inhibition of the IC-SNc circuit can mimic or reverse the 6-OHDA vulnerability caused by acute or chronic noise exposure. Mechanistically, noise exposure and IC-SNc circuit activation down-regulate vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in the SNc, and overexpression of VMAT2 in IC-innervated SNcDA neurons ameliorates noise exposure-induced 6-OHDA vulnerability. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of the IC-SNc circuit in early-stage PD mice in response to environmental noise, which has significance for preventing the onset and progression of PD and highlights the need for environmental harmony to reduce neurodegeneration.",10

The ANS exhibits some forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and plastic changes in neurotransmitter distribution, both of which may contribute to autonomic function. Dysautonomia refers to an abnormality in the function of the ANS, with an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Dysautonomia has been reported in conditions such as stress, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and premature death. In MS, the signs of dysautonomia include elevated plasma norepinephrine levels and increased arterial blood pressure. In this study, we characterized the effect of a high-sucrose diet (HSD) on synaptic plasticity in sympathetic ganglia of the rat by measuring LTP expression in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and analyzing the expression of acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA, as well as their balance of colocalization/segregation in ganglionic nerve terminals. The HSD consists of adding 30% sucrose to drinking water, which is an accepted model of MS. We observed an impairment in LTP expression, along with a decrease in ACh presence and a reduction in its segregation from GABA. These findings suggest the emergence of an inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission and plasticity within the SCG. We propose that dysautonomia associated with MS might involve changes in sympathetic activity, at least at the level of ganglionic cholinergic transmission. These results may help to improve our understanding of autonomic dysfunction in the context of this metabolic disorder.

[PMID: 41187062] While neuronal activity is essential for brain function, it also poses threats to neuronal integrity. Here, we show that activity-induced expression of stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) protects neurons from degeneration. Previously considered germline specific, Stra8 is expressed in the adult mouse brain and is induced by neuronal activity via calcium influx and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling. Neuron-specific Stra8 knockout mice display hallmark features of neurodegeneration, including DNA damage, impaired proteostasis, inflammation, nuclear envelope erosion, reduced dendritic plasticity, memory deficits, and heightened excitotoxic vulnerability. Electrophysiological studies reveal disrupted inhibitory circuit function. Mechanistically, Stra8 binds regulatory regions of neuromodulator genes and regulates their expression. Notably, Stra8 loss upregulates the expression of Npas4, an immediate-early gene critical for inhibitory circuits, but the aberrant protein is mislocalized to the nuclear periphery. These findings identify Stra8 as an activity-dependent transcriptional regulator that safeguards neuronal structure and function.

[PMID: 41187060] Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) represent a promising therapeutic resource, yet their immunometabolic regulation remains poorly defined. Here, we reveal a tunneling nanotube (TNT)-mediated communication mechanism between ADSCs and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) that maintains metabolic homeostasis during pregnancy. Using gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mouse models combined with live-cell imaging, scanning electron microscope, and multi-omics approaches, we demonstrate that mitochondrial transfer from ADSCs to ATMs via TNTs sustains ATM metabolic fitness. This process is governed by the WNT5A-RhoA-ROCK1 axis and becomes impaired under metabolic stress, driving ATMs inflammatory polarization and insulin resistance. Importantly, in situ ADSC administration restores mitochondrial transfer and improves metabolic parameters in GDM mice. Collectively, our work establishes TNT-mediated organelle sharing as a fundamental mechanism of stem cell-immune interaction and demonstrates that ADSC-based therapy represents a promising strategy for GDM by reprogramming the metabolism of immune cells.

[PMID: 41186777] Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis involves apoptosis, inflammation, lipogenesis, and insulin resistance. Hepatocyte apoptosis leads to liver injury and fibrosis, while inflammation exacerbates damage through immune cells and cytokines. Lipogenesis promotes fat accumulation and lipotoxicity, stressing hepatocytes, whereas insulin resistance impairs glucose metabolism and exacerbates dysfunction. Highlight the complexity of NASH and the need for multi-targeted therapies are highlighted by these interrelated processes. Using in silico transcriptomic analysis, this study identifies key microRNAs (miRNAs) in NASH and explores the relationship between miRNAs and circ-MYO9B in NASH. To find differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), miRNA expression profiles from the liver and blood datasets (GSE33857, GSE59492, and GSE49012) were examined. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced cirrhosis (NASH-CH)-related miRNA modules were discovered by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). RT-qPCR was used on tissue and blood samples to examine the expression and interaction of circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p in NASH patients, and dual-luciferase assays confirmed their direct interaction. Circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p were found to be significantly correlated in both blood and liver tissue in NASH-CH patients, according to expression analysis. RT-qPCR analysis validated their dysregulation, suggesting their role in the advancement of the disease. The direct interaction between circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p was confirmed by the dual-luciferase assay, indicating a regulatory function in metabolic pathways. By modulating this miRNA, circ-MYO9B may influence downstream pathways in which miR-193b-5p is known to be involved, such as lipogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that circ-MYO9B may represent a potential therapeutic target for addressing metabolic dysfunction associated with NASH, although further validation in hepatocyte-specific models is warranted.

[PMID: 41186757] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a significant pulmonary disorder that often leads to prolonged respiratory complications in preterm infants. This study aimed to characterize the lipidomic profiles in the tracheal aspirate (TA) of extremely preterm infants to identify specific lipid signatures associated with the development of BPD. This study involved 7 infants with BPD and 10 extremely preterm infants without BPD. TA samples were obtained at intubation from the non-BPD infants and at intubation as well as 7 days post-intubation from the BPD infants. Untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed to characterize the lipidomic signatures of TA. A total of 1189 lipid compounds were identified in the TA of infants with BPD and without BPD, with 298 significantly different lipid metabolites between the two groups at intubation. Notably, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were significantly decreased, while triglycerides, ceramides, phosphorylated fatty acid analogs, and diglycerides were significantly increased in the infants with BPD. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of differential lipids in pathways related to insulin resistance, vitamin digestion and absorption, lipolysis regulation in adipocytes, glycerolipid metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, and cholesterol metabolism. After intubation, infants with BPD exhibited 26 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated lipid metabolites, with enrichment primarily in metabolic pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism and autophagy.  This study identified distinct lipidomic alterations in the TA of BPD infants, suggesting the potential of these lipid profiles as early diagnostic biomarkers and as therapeutic intervention targets. • BPD is a serious pulmonary complication in preterm infants. Lipid synthesis and metabolism are vital for normal lung development. • Distinct lipidomic profiles in tracheal aspirate differentiate infants with and without BPD. • Tracheal aspirate lipid profiles show strong potential as novel early diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for BPD.

[PMID: 41186682] Following initially successful resuscitation and the achievement of a spontaneous rhythm, patients are mostly comatose and are transferred to the intensive care unit. The brain is particularly vulnerable for injuries under global ischemia or hypoxia and therefore severe brain damage without damage to other organs is a frequent occurrence. This is referred to as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and preferentially affects neurons in the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. The brain stem is less vulnerable. The unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), previously known as apallic syndrome or vegetative state, is a frequent form of HIE and can persist for years in a ventilation nursing home. In many patients multimodal neurological prognostication enables a reliable prediction on whether a relevant recovery of cerebral function is likely or impossible, even during the stay in the intensive care unit. These include the clinical neurological examination after a sufficiently long observational time of mostly at least 72h, cerebral imaging, i.e., cranial computed tomography (cCT), if necessary cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI), electrophysiological examinations (electroencephalography, EEG), median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and determination of blood biomarkers (neuron-specific enolase, NSE, neurofilament light chains, NFL). Findings that make a severe HIE very likely are a bilateral lack of pupillary light reflex 72h after resuscitation, bilateral absence of cortical median nerve SSEP, highly malignant EEG pattern, NSE levels > 90 ng/ml and a lack of gray-white differentiation of the cerebrum in cCT. A normal NSE or NFL level 48-96h after resuscitation, an early continuous EEG with responses to external stimuli, high amplitudes of the median nerve SSEP and a normal cMRI make a severe HIE improbable. If the short-term clinical course and the prognostic investigations do not provide a clear determination of the extent of the HIE, a time-limited trial of a neurological early rehabilitation can clarify the question whether regaining consciousness with relevant cognitive functions occurs or not.

[PMID: 41186653] Hypertension, a major cardiovascular risk, is affected by body composition and metabolism. We assessed the associations of body composition with hypertension and the mediating role of insulin resistance (IR). In Hefei Hongsifang Company, 743 employees aged 40-60 were recruited consecutively. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between body composition and hypertension risk. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore the mediating role of IR between body composition and hypertension risk. Individuals with higher body fat percentage (BF%) (OR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.64-3.65, P < 0.001) and Visceral adiposity index (VAI) (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.39-3.55, P < 0.001) had significantly higher odds of hypertension. Conversely, higher levels of skeletal muscle mass percentage (SMM%) (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.21-0.56, P < 0.001), total body water percentage (TBW%) (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.59, P < 0.001), and bone mineral content percentage (BMC%) (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.54, P < 0.001) were all linked to lower odds of hypertension. IR significantly mediated the associations between body composition and hypertension risk. The mediation proportions were as follows: 29.4% for BF%, 61.5% for VAI, 33.7% for SMM%, 34.9% for TBW%, and 31.4% for BMC%. Our study demonstrated that, in middle-aged individuals, lower BF% and VAI, as well as higher SMM%, TBW%, and BMC%, were independently associated with a reduced risk of hypertension. IR partially mediated the associations between body composition and hypertension.",10

The effect of inhibition of STAT‑3 (expressed constitutively in DU‑145 cells) with Stt and/or Tcz on expression levels of vimentin, VEGF, and E‑cadherin, as well as proliferative, clonogenic, migratory and invasive capacity of metastatic PCa cells was assessed. The expression levels of IL‑6, C‑X‑C chemokine ligand 8, VEGF and vimentin, as well as proliferation and migration, were increased in metastatic PCa cells. Treatment with Stt or Tcz decreased vimentin and VEGF and increased E‑cadherin expression levels and inhibited proliferative, clonogenic, migratory and invasive capacity of DU‑145 cells; addition of IL‑6 decreased this inhibitory effect. However, Stt + Tcz maintained inhibition even in the present of high concentrations of IL‑6. Stt + Tcz decreased expression of vimentin and VEGF and inhibited the proliferative, clonogenic, migratory and invasive capacity of metastatic PCa cells. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to combine Stt, a STAT‑3 inhibitor, with Tcz, an antibody against IL‑6R, to target tumor cells.

[PMID: 21057494] The transition from androgen-dependent to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal event of uncertain molecular etiology. Comparing gene expression in isogenic androgen-dependent and CRPC xenografts, we found a reproducible increase in N-cadherin expression, which was also elevated in primary and metastatic tumors of individuals with CRPC. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin in nonmetastatic, androgen-dependent prostate cancer models caused castration resistance, invasion and metastasis. Monoclonal antibodies against the ectodomain of N-cadherin reduced proliferation, adhesion and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, these antibodies slowed the growth of multiple established CRPC xenografts, blocked local invasion and metastasis and, at higher doses, led to complete regression. N-cadherin-specific antibodies markedly delayed the time to emergence of castration resistance, markedly affected tumor histology and angiogenesis, and reduced both AKT serine-threonine kinase activity and serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. These data indicate that N-cadherin is a major cause of both prostate cancer metastasis and castration resistance. Therapeutic targeting of this factor with monoclonal antibodies may have considerable clinical benefit.

[PMID: 41187218] Given the urgent need for more specific, sensitive, and non-invasive markers for prostate cancer screening and differential diagnosis, circulating miRNAs have emerged as valuable candidates. Sixty seven prostate cancer subjects in different stages were included in this study. The participants were categorized into groups based on their pathological characteristics as local, biochemical relapse and metastatic. We retrieved eligible datasets from GEO database to identify stage-specific differentially expressed up/down-regulated genes. Cytohubba, built-in application of Cytoscape software, and Reactome pathway database were applied to select hub genes. To select upstream miRNAs, we utilized the MiRWalk and miRNet online tools. To construct the miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks, we employed rna22. Finally, three miRNAs and five target genes were validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PCa patients compared with benign prostate hyperplasia. PSA level was also measured using ELISA. Our findings revealed the potential role of PRC1 and UBA52 to be used as biomarkers for the metastatic stage, RCC1 for both biochemical relapse, and metastatic subjects. Furthermore, elevated levels of miR-124-3p and downregulation of miR-133a-3p can be introduced as biochemical relapse stage identifier. We also identified the tumor suppressor role of miR-17-5p, which was associated with higher Gleason scores. We propose PRC1, UBA52, RCC1, miR-124-3p and miR133a-3p as stage-specific PCa identifiers.

[PMID: 41187199] Although prior research has indicated that nutritional and inflammatory markers may play a role in prostate cancer development, the exact interplay and underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The study population comprised 16,481 males from the NHANES database, after excluding participants with missing covariates. The Neutrophil Percentage-to-Albumin Ratio (NPAR) was used to assess the inflammation and nutritional status. Statistical methods such as multivariable logistic regression, eXtreme Gradient Boosting model, subgroup analysis, and Generalized Additive Model were used to analyze the relationship between NPAR and prostate cancer prevalence. The restricted cubic splines of the independent variable NPAR and the dependent variable (prostate cancer prevalence) were statistically significant based on the logistic regression analysis. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning model identified the NPAR and age as the most influential variables for prostate cancer. Subgroup analysis revealed significant correlations between the NPAR and age, race, and smoking status. Clinical validation has confirmed the diagnostic significance of NPAR in prostate cancer. A positive correlation was observed between NPAR and prostate cancer prevalence, indicating the potential mechanism of developing the disease. However, due to the cross-sectional design and self-reported cancer diagnoses in the NHANES database, causality cannot be established.

[PMID: 41186991] Predictive biomarkers to guide chemotherapy decisions for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are lacking. Preclinical studies indicate that circulating tumor cell (CTC) studies of chromosomal instability (CTC-CIN) can predict taxane resistance. The CARD trial randomized subjects with mCRPC progressing within a year of treatment with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI; enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone/prednisone) to cabazitaxel or the alternative ARPI. As a pre-planned biomarker analysis, CTCs were isolated from blood samples obtained at baseline; cycle two, and end of treatment. Associations between baseline CTC and CTC-CIN counts with imaging-based progression free survival (ibPFS), overall survival (OS), time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, RECIST 1.1 objective response rate (ORR), and PSA50 response rate (PRR) were assessed. High baseline CTC-CIN counts significantly associated with worse OS after adjustment for confounding variables (median OS, 15.3 vs 8.9 months; univariate HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.52 - 3.06; p < 0.001; multivariate HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.01 - 2.43; p = 0.047). Detectable CTC-CIN counts at baseline may predict a lack of ibPFS and OS benefit when comparing cabazitaxel to ARPI. This preplanned biomarker analysis of CARD confirms that CTC-CIN counts are a clinically useful prognostic and predictive biomarker of taxane resistance in mCRPC. Detectable CTC-CIN at baseline defines a patient subpopulation with unmet clinical needs in which alternative therapeutics should be tested. CARD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02485691.

[PMID: 41186967] Access to prostate MRI remains limited due to resource constraints and the need for expert interpretation. To develop machine learning (ML) models that enable risk-based triage for prostate MRI (ProMT-ML) in the evaluation of prostate cancer. Retrospective and prospective. A total of 11,879 retrospective MRI scans for suspected prostate cancer from a multi-hospital health system, divided into training (N = 9504) and test (N = 2375) sets. A total of 4551 records for prospective validation. 1.5T and 3T/Turbo-spin echo T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE). Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores were retrieved from MRI reports. The Boruta algorithm was used to select final input features from candidate features. Two models were developed using supervised ML to estimate the likelihood of an abnormal MRI, defined as PI-RADS ≥ 3: Model A (with prostate volume) and Model B (without prostate volume). Models were compared to PSA. Prostate biopsy pathology was assessed to evaluate potential clinical impact. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was the primary performance metric. A total of 5580 (46.9%) subjects had a PI-RADS score ≥ 3. After feature selection, Model A included age, PSA, body mass index, and prostate volume, while Model B included age, PSA, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. Both models A (AUC 0.711) and B (AUC 0.616) significantly outperformed PSA (AUC 0.593). Compared to PSA threshold > 4 ng/mL, Model A demonstrated significantly improved specificity (28.3% vs. 21.9%) and no significant difference in sensitivity (89.0% vs. 86.7%). Among false negatives (Model A: 8.0% (62/776); Model B: 16.8% (130/776)), most (Model A: 87%; Model B: 69%) had benign or clinically insignificant disease on biopsy. On prospective validation, both versions of ProMT-ML significantly outperformed PSA. ProMT-ML provides personalized risk estimates of abnormal prostate MRI and can support triage of this test.

[PMID: 41186950] The choice of first line hormonal therapy in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) is often based on comorbidities or physician preference due to the lack of data comparing abiraterone and enzalutamide in clinical trials and in clinical practice settings, especially in African American patients. To compare clinical outcomes in patients with mHSPC treated with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. This cohort study included all patients with mHSPC diagnoses in the US Veterans Affairs Health Care system who initiated abiraterone or enzalutamide between July 2017 and April 2023. Data were analyzed from April 2024 to March 2025. Receipt of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. Drug outcomes were established by estimating rates of tumor growth (g-rates) using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values while receiving therapy and measuring overall survival (OS). Two different matching analyses were performed: inverse probability weighting (IPW) and 1:1 exact matching. A total of 1258 patients (median [IQR] age, 73 [69-79] years; 314 [25.0%] African American, 857 [68.1%] White, and 87 [6.9%] with other or unknown race) who received abiraterone and 311 patients (median [IQR] age, 74 [69-79] years; 84 [27.0%] African American, 207 [66.6%] White, and 20 [6.4%] with other or unknown race) who received enzalutamide were included. In the unweighted analysis, the abiraterone cohort had median (IQR) g-rate of 0.000137/d (0.000094-0.001519) and the enzalutamide cohort, 0.000137/d (0.000098-0.001815); median (IQR) OS was 36.2 (32.8-38.8) months for abiraterone and 36.2 (34.1-40.5) months for enzalutamide, with a median (IQR) follow-up of 28.7 (15.6-45.6) and 30.8 (16.1-39.1) months, respectively. In IPW analysis, using abiraterone as reference, the weighted median OS was comparable between abiraterone and enzalutamide in the full cohort (36.2; 95% CI, 32.8-38.8 vs 35.5; 95 % CI, 32.9-40.4 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92-1.30; P = .32), African American veterans (39.7; 95% CI, 34.3-46.6 vs 40.3; 95% CI, 34.3-not reached months; HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.72-1.34; P = .90) and those with cardiovascular disease (31.5; 95% CI, 28.1-35.5 vs 35.0; 95% CI, 30.7-38.9; HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.91-1.37; P = .30). In 1:1 matched analysis, both the abiraterone and enzalutamide groups had 279 patients with 63 (23%) who were African American; these patients had a median (IQR) follow-up of 27.3 (15.3-40.8) and 31.1 (16.8-39.9) months, respectively. The 1:1 matched cohort consisted of 158 patients (57%) in each group with an initial Gleason score of 8 or higher, and 224 patients (80%) in each group with a PSA value of 50 ng/mL or higher at treatment initiation. For the 1:1 matched cohort and its subgroups of African American patients, patients with Gleason scores of 8 or higher, and patients with a starting PSA level of 50 ng/mL or higher, no statistically significant difference in median g-rate and OS was observed. This cohort study found that abiraterone and enzalutamide had comparable outcomes in a first-line mHSPC setting, with similar g-rates and OS in both White and African American patients. There were no differences in survival or g-rate between treatment based on race, comorbidities, and prostate cancer features, including Gleason score, PSA, and volume of disease.

[PMID: 41186921] In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided online adaptive radiotherapy, MRI lacks tissue attenuation information necessary for accurate dose calculations. Although deep learning (DL)-based synthetic computed tomography (CT) generation models have been developed to obtain CT density information from MRI, they usually do not meet the requirement of real-time plan adaptation. We propose a DL-based photon dose calculation method directly on 0.35 T MRI to skip synthetic CT generation and show its feasibility for prostate patient cases. The 0.35 T planning MRI and deformed planning CT (registered to the planning MRI) of 34 prostate cancer patients treated with a 0.35 T magnetic resonance-linear accelerator (MR-Linac) were collected. The air cavities (ACs) in the abdominopelvic area of the deformed CT images were corrected based on manual AC contouring on the MRI. Monte Carlo (MC) dose simulations under a 0.35 T magnetic field were performed on the corrected CT images. All photon beams were simulated using a uniform field size of <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn> <mspace></mspace> <mtext>cm</mtext> <mo>×</mo> <mn>1</mn> <mspace></mspace> <mtext>cm</mtext></mrow> <annotation>$1\,\text{cm} \times 1\,\text{cm}$</annotation></semantics> </math> . 10 800 beams were simulated with <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <semantics><mrow><mn>5</mn> <mo>×</mo> <msup><mn>10</mn> <mn>6</mn></msup> </mrow> <annotation>$5\times 10^6$</annotation></semantics> </math> initial photons for training (20 patients) and 2160 beams with <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <semantics><mrow><mn>5</mn> <mo>×</mo> <msup><mn>10</mn> <mn>7</mn></msup> </mrow> <annotation>$5\times 10^7$</annotation></semantics> </math> photons for validation (4 patients).

Monoclonal antibody targeting of N-cadherin encourages metastasis.,Monoclonal Antibodies AND N-cadherin AND Metastasis AND Cancer,"40895189,40806753,39082961,38452580,38052206,38030131,37461464,36077593,35921442,35583238","[PMID: 40895189] Radiation therapy is a fundamental component of cancer treatment, benefiting 50%-70% of patients by selectively targeting malignant tissues. However, radioresistance remains a significant challenge, often driven by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT increases cancer invasiveness and metastasis by upregulating mesenchymal markers, including vimentin and N-cadherin, and downregulating epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin. EMT under radiation involves principal signaling pathways, including TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and ERK, which regulate EMT through transcription factors such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and Zeb1/2. These alterations drive cytoskeletal reorganization, decrease cell-cell adhesion, and enhance extracellular matrix degradation via integrins, MMP-2, and MMP-9. We also explored how growth hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment affect radiation-induced EMT. Targeting EMT pathways with monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors of signaling pathways may help overcome radioresistance. However, due to the dual role of EMT in cancer progression and tissue regeneration, precise treatment strategies are essential. There is a lack of comprehensive multi-omics studies that provide insights into postradiation EMT progression. This review examines how radiation induces EMT and its impact on metastasis and immune responses while also proposing therapeutic approaches. Integrating EMT-targeting strategies with existing cancer treatments could enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy and improve patient outcomes.

[PMID: 40806753] CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) is a marker of colorectal cancer stem cells with high metastatic potential and resistance to therapy. Although CD26 expression is known to be associated with tumor progression, its functional involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of a monoclonal anti-CD26 antibody on EMT-related phenotypes and metastatic behavior in colorectal cancer cells. We evaluated changes in EMT markers by quantitative PCR and Western blotting, assessed cell motility and invasion using scratch wound-healing and Transwell assays, and examined metastatic potential in vivo using a splenic injection mouse model. Treatment with the anti-CD26 antibody significantly increased the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and reduced levels of EMT-inducing transcription factors, including ZEB1, Twist1, and Snail1, at the mRNA and protein levels. Functional assays revealed that the antibody markedly inhibited cell migration and invasion in vitro without exerting cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, systemic administration of the anti-CD26 antibody significantly suppressed the formation of liver metastases in vivo. These findings suggest that CD26 may contribute to the regulation of EMT and metastatic behavior in colorectal cancer. Our data highlight the potential therapeutic utility of CD26-targeted antibody therapy for suppressing EMT-associated phenotypes and metastatic progression.

[PMID: 39082961] HCC is one of the most lethal cancers for humans. Mannosidase alpha class 2A member 1 (MAN2A1)-FER is one of the most frequent oncogenic fusion genes in HCC. In this report, we showed that MAN2A1-FER ectopically phosphorylated the extracellular domains of PDGFRA, MET, AXL, and N-cadherin. The ectopic phosphorylation of these transmembrane proteins led to the activation of their kinase activities and initiated the activation cascades of their downstream signaling molecules. A panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies was developed to recognize the ectopic phosphorylation sites of PDGFRA. The analyses showed that these antibodies bound to the specific phosphotyrosine epitopes in the extracellular domain of PDGFRA with high affinity and specificity. The treatment of MAN2A1-FER-positive cancer HUH7 with one of the antibodies called 2-3B-G8 led to the deactivation of cell growth signaling pathways and cell growth arrest while having minimal impact on HUH7ko cells where MAN2A1-FER expression was disrupted. The treatment of 2-3B-G8 antibody also led to a large number of cell deaths of MAN2A1-FER-positive cancer cells such as HUH7, HEPG2, SNU449, etc., while the same treatment had no impact on HUH7ko cells. When severe combined immunodeficiency mice xenografted with HEPG2 or HUH7 were treated with monomethyl auristatin E-conjugated 2-3B-G8 antibody, it slowed the progression of tumor growth, eliminated the metastasis, and reduced the mortality, in comparison with the controls. Targeting the cancer-specific ectopic phosphorylation sites of PDGFRA induced by MAN2A1-FER may hold promise as an effective treatment for liver cancer.

[PMID: 38452580] Cadherin-17 (CDH17) is a membranous cell adhesion protein predominantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. CDH17 is therefore considered a possible diagnostic and therapeutic target. This study was to comprehensively determine the expression of CDH17 in cancer and to further assess the diagnostic utility of CDH17 immunohistochemistry (IHC). A tissue microarray containing 14,948 interpretable samples from 150 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by IHC. In normal tissues, a membranous CDH17 staining was predominantly seen in the epithelium of the intestine and pancreatic excretory ducts. In tumors, 53 of 150 analyzed categories showed CDH17 positivity including 26 categories with at least one strongly positive case. CDH17 positivity was most common in epithelial and neuroendocrine colorectal neoplasms (50.0%-100%), other gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (42.7%-61.6%), mucinous ovarian cancer (61.1%), pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (28.6%), cervical adenocarcinoma (52.6%), bilio-pancreatic adenocarcinomas (40.5-69.8%), and other neuroendocrine neoplasms (5.6%-100%). OnIy 9.9% of 182 pulmonary adenocarcinomas were CDH17 positive. In colorectal adenocarcinomas, reduced CDH17 staining was linked to high pT (p = 0.0147), nodal metastasis (p = 0.0041), V1 (p = 0.0025), L1 (p = 0.0054), location in the right colon (p = 0.0033), and microsatellite instability (p < 0.0001). The CDH17 expression level was unrelated to tumor phenotype in gastric and pancreatic cancer. In summary, our comprehensive overview on CDH17 expression in human tumors identified various tumor entities that might often benefit from anti-CDH17 therapies and suggest utility of CDH17 IHC for the distinction of metastatic gastrointestinal or bilio-pancreatic adenocarcinomas (often positive) from primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas (mostly negative).

[PMID: 38052206] E-cadherins (Ecads) are a crucial cell-cell adhesion protein with tumor suppression properties. Ecad adhesion can be enhanced by the monoclonal antibody 66E8, which has potential applications in inhibiting cancer metastasis. However, the biophysical mechanisms underlying 66E8-mediated adhesion strengthening are unknown. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations, site-directed mutagenesis, and single-molecule atomic force microscopy experiments to demonstrate that 66E8 strengthens Ecad binding by stabilizing the primary Ecad adhesive conformation: the strand-swap dimer. By forming electrostatic interactions with Ecad, 66E8 stabilizes the swapped β-strand and its hydrophobic pocket and impedes Ecad conformational changes, which are necessary for rupture of the strand-swap dimer. Our findings identify fundamental mechanistic principles for strengthening of Ecad binding using monoclonal antibodies.

[PMID: 38030131] Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) is characterised by invasive and metastatic behaviour and is poorly responsive to current treatments, hence the need for new therapeutic strategies. FOSCC shares molecular targets with human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), among these the epidermal growth factor receptor. Cetuximab is an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody employed in the therapy of HNSCC and, interestingly, previous work in vitro suggested that it displays cytostatic and cytotoxic properties also against FOSCC. With the present study, we aimed at further investigating the effects of cetuximab on invasion and metastasis pathways proven to be relevant in human patients. To this purpose, FOSCC cell lines SCCF1, SCCF2 and SCCF3 were treated with cetuximab for 48/72 h and subjected to Western blot for matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers vimentin, E-, P- and N-cadherin. Treatment with cetuximab resulted in downregulation of MMP-2/-9 in all of the three cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, cetuximab downregulated vimentin and P-cadherin in SCCF1, upregulated E-cadherin whilst downregulating P-/N-cadherins in SCCF2, and impaired P-/N-cadherins in SCCF3. An in vitro scratch test also demonstrated that cetuximab delayed cell migration in SCCF3. These data suggest that cetuximab mitigates invasion and metastasis processes by impairing MMPs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways in FOSCC, indicating that this monoclonal antibody may help to counteract malignant progression and improve the management of locally invasive disease.

[PMID: 36077593] Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) occurs in 20% of all breast cancer subtypes, especially those that present the worst prognostic outcome through a very invasive and aggressive tumour. HCC-1954 (HER-2+) is a highly invasive, metastatic cell line, whereas MCF-7 is mildly aggressive and non-invasive. We investigated membrane proteins from both cell lines that could have a pivotal biological significance in metastasis. Membrane protein enrichment for HCC-1954 and MCF-7 proteomic analysis was performed. The samples were analysed and quantified by mass spectrometry. High abundance membrane proteins were confirmed by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. Protein interaction prediction and correlations with the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient data were conducted by bioinformatic analysis. In addition, β1 integrin expression was analysed by Western blot in cells upon trastuzumab treatment. The comparison between HCC-1954 and MCF-7 membrane-enriched proteins revealed that proteins involved in cytoskeleton organisation, such as HER-2, αv and β1 integrins, E-cadherin, and CD166 were more abundant in HCC-1954. β1 integrin membrane expression was higher in the HCC-1954 cell line resistant after trastuzumab treatment. TCGA data analysis showed a trend toward a positive correlation between HER-2 and β1 integrin in HER-2+ breast cancer patients. Differences in protein profile and abundance reflected distinctive capabilities for aggressiveness and invasiveness between HCC-1954 and MCF-7 cell line phenotypes. The higher membrane β1 integrin expression after trastuzumab treatment in the HCC-1954 cell line emphasised the need for investigating the contribution of β1 integrin modulation and its effect on the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance.

[PMID: 35921442] E-cadherin (Ecad) is an essential cell-cell adhesion protein with tumor suppression properties. The adhesive state of Ecad can be modified by the monoclonal antibody 19A11, which has potential applications in reducing cancer metastasis. Using X-ray crystallography, we determine the structure of 19A11 Fab bound to Ecad and show that the antibody binds to the first extracellular domain of Ecad near its primary adhesive motif: the strand-swap dimer interface. Molecular dynamics simulations and single-molecule atomic force microscopy demonstrate that 19A11 interacts with Ecad in two distinct modes: one that strengthens the strand-swap dimer and one that does not alter adhesion. We show that adhesion is strengthened by the formation of a salt bridge between 19A11 and Ecad, which in turn stabilizes the swapped β-strand and its complementary binding pocket. Our results identify mechanistic principles for engineering antibodies to enhance Ecad adhesion.

[PMID: 35583238] Cadherins are cell-surface proteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion. By regulating their grip formation and strength, cadherins play a pivotal role during normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. However, their dysfunction is associated with cell migration and proliferation, cancer progression and metastasis. The conserved amino acid sequence His-Ala-Val (HAV) in the extracellular domain of cadherins is implicated in cadherin-mediated adhesion and migration. Antagonists of cadherin adhesion such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors based on HAV peptides, are of high therapeutic value in cancer treatment. However, antibodies are not stable outside their natural environment and are expensive to produce, while peptides have certain limitations as a drug as they are prone to proteolysis. Herein, we propose as alternative, a synthetic antibody based on molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP-NGs) to target the HAV domain. The MIP-NGs are biocompatible, have high affinity for N-cadherin and inhibit cell adhesion and migration of human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells, as demonstrated by cell aggregation and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. The emergence of MIPs as therapeutics for fighting cancer is still in its infancy and this novel demonstration reinforces the fact that they have a rightful place in cancer treatment.",10
Mutations in RIM1 raise levels of IME1 RNA.,RIM1 AND IME1 AND mutation AND RNA,"8417990,41187380,41187342,41187335,41187221,41187218,41187205,41187195,41187174,41187171","[PMID: 8417990] Meiosis and spore formation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with increased expression of sporulation-specific genes. One of these genes, IME2, encodes a putative protein kinase that is a positive regulator of other sporulation-specific genes. We have isolated mutations that cause reduced expression of an ime2-lacZ fusion gene. We found mutations in IME1, a known positive regultor of IME2, and MCK1, a known positive regulator of IME1. We also isolated recessive mutations in 12 other genes, which we designate RIM (Regulator of IME2) genes. Our analysis indicates that the defects in rim1, rim8, rim9 and rim13 mutants are a consequence of diminished IME1 expression and can be suppressed by expression of IME1 from the heterologous ACT1 promoter. These rim mutations also reduced expression of an ime1-HIS3 fusion, in which the HIS3 gene is expressed from the IME1 promoter, and caused reduced levels of IME1 RNA. Although the rim1, rim8, rim9 and rim13 mutant phenotypes are similar to those of mck1 mutants, we found that the defects in ime2-lacZ expression and sporulation of the mck1 rim double mutants were more severe than either single mutant. In contrast, the defects of the rim rim double mutants were similar to either single mutant. The rim1, rim8, rim9 and rim13 mutants also display slow growth at 17 degrees and share a smooth colony morphology that is not evident in mck1 mutants or isogenic wild-type strains. We suggest that RIM1, RIM8, RIM9 and RIM13 encode functionally related products that act in parallel to MCK1 to stimulate IME1 expression.

[PMID: 41187380] Mutations of the Ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene are generally associated with syndromic tooth agenesis, yet their influence on non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) has not been thoroughly elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the genetic basis of NSTA and to identify pathogenic EDA mutations in two Chinese families using whole-exome sequencing, and explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Two unrelated individuals with NSTA and their families were enrolled in this study, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Whole-exome sequencing was performed, followed by variants detection and filtering to identify pathogenic genes and mutations. The identified genetic mutations were further validated by Sanger sequencing and confirmed to be absent in 300 unrelated healthy individuals. Conservation analysis, three-dimensional (3D) modeling, and electrostatic potential calculations were conducted accordingly. We identified a novel mutation c.827 G>T (p.Arg276Leu) and a previously reported mutation c.1069 C>T (p.Arg357Trp) in the EDA gene, with the latter showing previously unreported phenotypic characteristics. Both mutations are located in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) domain of EDA, which is crucial for binding with ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR). Conservation analysis indicated that these mutations are evolutionarily conserved across various species. In silico predictions and 3D modeling analyses suggested that these mutations may be pathogenic, potentially due to alterations in the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic potential, thereby affecting EDA-EDAR interaction. Our findings broaden the mutation spectrum of EDA gene associated with NSTA by identifying a novel mutation and provide a basis for future genetic counseling.

[PMID: 41187342] The efficacy of artesunate + amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether + lumefantrine (AL) for treating malaria was investigated in Madagascar in 2020. A randomized parallel-group study was conducted at four health centers (Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, and Matanga in the southeastern region and Ankazomborona in the northwestern region). The therapeutic efficacy and safety of ASAQ and AL were assessed using the WHO protocol, with a 28-day follow-up period. Children aged 6 months to 14 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria were randomly assigned to receive either ASAQ or AL. Genotyping assays for the pfK13 gene were conducted on P. falciparum isolates obtained from dry blood samples collected on Day 0. Of 765 enrolled patients, 709 (92.7%) reached the study endpoint. Among the per-protocol population, crude adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rates were 99%, 99%, 100%, and 100% for Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, Matanga, and Ankazomborona, respectively, in the ASAQ group and 98%, 91%, 90%, and 100% for the same locations, respectively, in the AL group. Polymerase chain reaction-corrected ACPR rates were 100% for the ASAQ group at all study sites, whereas for the AL group, they were 98.8% in Antsenavolo, 97.6% in Vohitromby, 100% in Matanga, and 100% in Ankazomborona. Day 3 slide positivity rates were 0%, 1%, 1%, and 0% for Antsenavolo, Vohitromby, Matanga, and Ankazomborona, respectively. During follow-up, mild and moderate adverse events, including gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain and vomiting) and headache, were reported in 10.2% (72/709) of patients. Of 727 samples successfully analyzed for pfK13, no mutation associated with artemisinin resistance was observed. The study results reveal that ASAQ and AL remain safe and efficacious for treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Madagascar.

[PMID: 41187335] DNA nanostructure-enabled functional constructs have shown potential to improve healthcare outcomes by offering advanced disease diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Translating this potential of DNA nanostructure-based constructs to real life applications relies on maintaining and enhancing the structural integrity and functions of the surface-anchored moieties. In this study, we explored the possibility of utilizing choline dihydrogen phosphate (CDHP) solution, an aqueous solution of ionic liquid, to assemble DNA nanostructures of different sizes and complexities with enhanced biostability and ligand binding affinity. We show successful formation of the DNA nanostructures in aqueous CDHP solution using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and circular dichroism (CD). Biostability assays reveal that the aqueous CDHP solution may provide passive protection to DNA nanostructures against DNase I and human serum for up to 48 h. We also demonstrate that this enhanced biostability arises both from the structural conformation imparted during CDHP-mediated folding and from the presence of free CDHP ions in the solution. Notably, removal of free ions reduced the passive protection effect, but did not eliminate it, indicating the contribution of both folding and surrounding free ions. Using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we show that the presence of aqueous CDHP solution can enhance the binding of aptamer-functionalized DNA nanostructures to specific receptors on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Our strategy of using ionic liquid solution for one-pot preparation with enhanced stability and functionality offers a robust, simpler and faster alternative for DNA nanostructure-based constructs.

[PMID: 41187221] The penetrant D463H mutation in <i>PRKCA</i>, which encodes the kinase PKCα, is a biomarker and driver of chordoid glioma, a type of brain cancer. Here, we found that heterozygous knock-in expression of the D463H mutant in mice elicited the development of chondrosarcomas. The mutant protein kinase was catalytically inactive, but no such oncogenic phenotype was observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N, indicating that the lack of activity per se was not the cause of the oncogenicity of the D463H mutant. In cultured glioma cells, the behavior of the D463H mutant closely mirrored that of wild-type PKCα and retained ATP binding, unlike the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, PKCα D463H displayed quantitative alterations in its interactome compared with that of the wild-type kinase, with enhanced association with epigenetic regulators. This change in the interactome aligned with transcriptomic changes that resembled an increased PKCα-induced expression program, with enhanced gene signatures mediated by BRD4, MYC, and TGF-β. D463H expression reduced the sensitivity of cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153, indicating the functional importance of these pathways. The findings indicate that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant that operates through a noncatalytic allosteric mechanism.

[PMID: 41187218] Given the urgent need for more specific, sensitive, and non-invasive markers for prostate cancer screening and differential diagnosis, circulating miRNAs have emerged as valuable candidates. Sixty seven prostate cancer subjects in different stages were included in this study. The participants were categorized into groups based on their pathological characteristics as local, biochemical relapse and metastatic. We retrieved eligible datasets from GEO database to identify stage-specific differentially expressed up/down-regulated genes. Cytohubba, built-in application of Cytoscape software, and Reactome pathway database were applied to select hub genes. To select upstream miRNAs, we utilized the MiRWalk and miRNet online tools. To construct the miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks, we employed rna22. Finally, three miRNAs and five target genes were validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PCa patients compared with benign prostate hyperplasia. PSA level was also measured using ELISA. Our findings revealed the potential role of PRC1 and UBA52 to be used as biomarkers for the metastatic stage, RCC1 for both biochemical relapse, and metastatic subjects. Furthermore, elevated levels of miR-124-3p and downregulation of miR-133a-3p can be introduced as biochemical relapse stage identifier. We also identified the tumor suppressor role of miR-17-5p, which was associated with higher Gleason scores. We propose PRC1, UBA52, RCC1, miR-124-3p and miR133a-3p as stage-specific PCa identifiers.

[PMID: 41187205] Dopamine is known to play a role in the development of myopia. In this study, we investigated the effect of dopamine (DA) on the secretion of transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Additionally, we examined the effects of SCH23390 (D1 receptor antagonist) and sulpiride (D2 receptor antagonist) on TGF-β2 levels in ARPE-19 cells to elucidate the underlying mechanism of DA in myopia development. Human RPE cells were cultured with or without different concentrations of DA, SCH23390, or sulpiride. Cell proliferation was examined using the CCK-8 assay. Cell migration was assessed by performing a cell scratch (wound healing) assay. The expression of TGF-β2 was evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Furthermore, the secretion of TGF-β2 into the ARPE-19 cell supernatant was quantified using ELISA. Treatment with 20 μg/mL of DA significantly increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA and protein expression levels of DRD1, DRD2, YAP, and TEAD and decreased TGF-β2 levels compared with that in control group. However, treatment with 24 μg/mL of SCH23390 for 24 h significantly decreased (P < 0.05) DRD1 and TGF-β2 mRNA expression and increased DRD2, YAP, and TEAD mRNA expression in ARPE-19 cells compared with that in the control group. Additionally, the protein expression levels of TGF-β2, YAP, TEAD, and SMAD7 were consistent with the mRNA levels. Notably, treatment with sulpiride (14 μg/mL) increased (P < 0.05) DRD1 and TGF-β2 expression and decreased DRD2, YAP, and TEAD expression in the cells at both the mRNA and protein levels compared with that in the control group. Our findings suggest that dopamine suppresses TGF-β2 secretion in human retinal pigment epithelial cells primarily through activation of D2 receptors, which appears to involve the YAP-TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway. This regulatory mechanism may contribute to the control of scleral remodeling and thus influence the development of myopia.

[PMID: 41187195] Serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening is crucial for early diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. This study presents the results of CrAg screening among people living with HIV (PLWH) followed in our clinic over the past six years. Patients with a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells/µL who were tested for CrAg were included in the study. Data regarding age, gender, comorbidities, CD4+ T cell count, HIV RNA level, blood culture results, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings-including CrAg, microscopy, culture, and PCR-were retrospectively collected. Descriptive statistical methods were used for the analysis. Serum CrAg testing was performed on 99 patients, nine of whom tested positive. Among the patients with positive antigenemia, four were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. In two cases, serum CrAg positivity was interpreted as false-positive due to the absence of clinical or laboratory findings consistent with cryptococcal infection. One patient died shortly after the CrAg test and could not be further evaluated. Two patients were lost to follow-up; however, one of them presented with symptoms two months later and was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. Additionally, there was one patient with confirmed cryptococcal meningitis despite an initial negative serum CrAg result. CrAg positivity may be detected during the asymptomatic phase of cryptococcal infection. Although current guidelines recommend serum CrAg screening for individuals with CD4+ T cell counts below 100 cells/µL, the detection of positive results in those with CD4+ T cell counts above this threshold should also be carefully evaluated, considering the possibility of false-positive or false-negative results.

[PMID: 41187174] Pitanga (Eugenia uniflora L.), a member of the Myrtaceae family, is native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and distributed across various ecological environments, including regions with contrasting edaphoclimatic conditions. Known for its production of secondary metabolites with significant biological activity, pitanga holds considerable pharmacological potential. Genomic and transcriptomic resources for this species are therefore valuable for understanding the genetic mechanisms that enable its adaptation to diverse ecosystems and for identifying candidate genes relevant for crop improvement and bioprospection. To explore whether genetic diversity is associated with population adaptation to environmental conditions, we first generated a draft genome of E. uniflora, totaling 385.1 Mbp with an N50 value of 26,199 bp, assembled de novo from Illumina-sequence reads. Likewise, gene prediction, based on Viridiplantae protein references, identified 30,663 protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics revealed 2,219 orthologous clusters, 40% of which were functionally annotated and encompassing 1,772 gene ontology terms. This draft genome also facilitated the identification of microsatellite markers, whose variation was analyzed across pitanga samples from two contrasting natural environments: Restinga and Riparian forest. The microsatellite profile showed a natural bias towards monomeric repeats, with genetic diversity differences across both populations that could be used as molecular markers for phenotype selection and plant breeding. Furthermore, RNA sequencing coupled with a Transcriptogram approach revealed significant differences in gene expression between the two populations. Pitangas from the Restinga ecosystem exhibited a stronger stress response, with distinct gene expression patterns associated with osmoprotection, cell wall modification, detoxification, nutrient balance, and epigenetic regulation. These patterns are likely linked to enhanced adaptation to the water and osmotic stress conditions, characteristic of this environment. Together, these findings enhance our knowledge of genetic diversity within E. uniflora populations and the molecular basis of their environmental adaptability. Such insights are critical for understanding how plants rapidly adapt to climate change and how these adaptations affect population dynamics, important for conservation strategies, population management, and the development of resilient cultivars.

[PMID: 41187171] Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a highly aggressive lung cancer with poor prognosis due to lack of reliable biomarkers. Resistance to anoikis drives tumor progression and metastasis. This study aims to develop and validate an anoikis-related prognostic model for LUAD. We employed univariate Cox regression analysis, LASSO regression, and random forest algorithms to identify anoikis-related genes (ARG) from bulk transcriptomic datasets, and establish a 7-gene prognostic signature, validated in two LUAD cohorts from GEO database. We evaluated immune infiltration, molecular functions, and genomic alterations between risk groups and analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data. IHC and mIF validated TIMP1 expression and its interaction with Treg cells. We developed a 7-gene prognostic model (LDHA, PLK1, TRAF2, ITGB4, SLCO1B3, TIMP1, ZEB2) using machine learning to predict survival in LUAD patients. The model accurately predicted 1-year survival rates (GSE31210: AUC = 0.805; GSE30219: AUC = 0.787), 2-year survival rates (GSE31210: AUC = 0.769; GSE30219: AUC = 0.681), and 3-year survival rates (GSE31210: AUC = 0.695; GSE30219: AUC = 0.735) and correlated with clinical features, immune infiltration, and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling. Single-cell sequencing data showed that LUAD patients exhibited an immunosuppressive TME phenotype, which was exacerbated by high TIMP1 expression in epithelial cells, promoting Treg cell activity. The 7-gene ARG prognostic model established in this study shows promising potential as a clinically applicable tool for decision-making.",10

In the present study, novel mutations in the connection domain of RT (T369I/V), first identified in patient-derived viruses, were characterized, and their effects on NNRTI and NNRTI susceptibility were determined. Furthermore, the effect of N348I on NRTI and NNRTI resistance was confirmed. HIV-1 with either N348I or T369I/V demonstrated reduced susceptibility to nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), delaviridine (DLV), and zidovudine (ZDV) compared to wild-type HIV-1. However, HIV-1 with T369I and N348I demonstrated 10- to 60-fold resistance to these same drugs. In clinical samples, these two connection domain RT mutations were predominantly observed in viruses containing TAMs and NNRTI mutations and did not alter the susceptible-resistant classifications of these samples. Introduction of T369I, N348I, or T369I/N348I also reduced replication capacity (RC). These observations suggest that it may be of scientific interest to test these mutations against new NNRTI candidates.

[PMID: 41187383] High breast density impairs mammographic cancer detection. We investigated if contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) performance is less affected by density compared to conventional mammography, addressing this critical gap. This study retrospectively included 326 adult female patients. The study protocol was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform. Each image was annotated and evaluated by a minimum of two expert radiologists, while a team of radiologists produced detailed medical reports and manual segmentation annotations for abnormal findings. The reference standards for lesion classification included follow-up assessments and pathological evaluations. The overall malignant breast lesion diagnosis for CESM yielded a sensitivity of 95.4 % (95 % CI = 92.4 %-97.5 %) and a specificity of 94.0 % (95 % CI = 91.8 %-95.7 %). Conventional mammography demonstrated a sensitivity of 85.0 % (CI = 80.5 %-88.8 %) and a specificity of 93.5 % (95 % CI = 91.3 %-95.3 %), which were both slightly lower than those achieved with CESM. In level A density, both conventional mammography and CESM demonstrated complete sensitivity and specificity. At density levels B, C, and D, CESM demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional mammography. Our findings indicate that as breast density transitions from fatty (level A) to dense (level D), CESM retains its sensitivity, while conventional mammography shows a decrease. Integrating CESM into clinics could enhance reporting systems and facilitate clinical decision-making, especially for patients with dense breast tissue. CESM showed superior diagnostic performance in the detection of malignant lesions compared to conventional mammography. CESM retains its diagnostic performance at varying levels of breast densities in contrast to conventional mammography.

[PMID: 41187381] The aim of this study was to assess the dose-dependent effects of radiotherapy on the progression of apical periodontitis (AP) in rats. Forty-five animals were divided into five groups based on radiation dose and apical periodontitis induction (n = 9): AP-RT7 (irradiated with a dose of 7.5 Gy + AP); AP-RT10 (10 Gy dose + AP); AP-RT15 (15 Gy dose + AP); AP (AP without radiation), and Control (no intervention). Radiation therapy was administered on the first day of the experiment. After seven days, the apical periodontitis induction was carried out in all groups except Control. All animals were euthanized after 21 days of AP progression (day 28), and the area and volume of AP were analyzed using radiography, micro-CT, and histological analyses. Inflammation intensity and extent were assessed histologically. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's t test for quantitative data, and Kruskal-Wallis for ordinal data (P < 0.05). The AP-RT15 group exhibited significantly larger apical periodontitis lesions compared to the AP-RT7.5, AP-RT10, and AP groups, as demonstrated by radiographic (p < 0.05), micro-CT (p < 0.0001), and histological analyses (p < 0.0001). Histological examination further revealed a more extensive and intense inflammatory response in the AP-RT15 group (p < 0.01). Overall, radiotherapy contributed to increased apical bone resorption and exacerbated inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The progression of apical periodontitis in irradiated animals follows a dose-dependent pattern, with higher radiation doses markedly amplifying the lesion's area, volume, and inflammatory severity.

[PMID: 41187378] The high moisture content and perishability of the mulberry fruit restrict its high-value utilization. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) were extracted from mulberries using ultrasound-assisted acid, alkali, and enzymatic extraction processes. The structural and functional characteristics were systematically analyzed. The highest yield of SDF (23.61 %) obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction. Structural analysis showed that both IDF and SDF had a loose and porous structure with several exposed functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Functional experiments showed that IDF exhibited superior cholesterol- and nitrite-adsorption capacities compared with SDF. IDF and SDF obtained through ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities for glucose, cholesterol, and nitrite. In conclusion, ultrasound-assisted alkali extraction simultaneously enhances both the yield and functional properties of dietary fiber extracted from mulberry, providing an effective strategy for developing high-value functional ingredients and promoting sustainable utilization of the fruit.

[PMID: 41187374] The aim of this umbrella review was to synthesise existing evidence from systematic reviews on the impact of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on recovery in intensive care units. This umbrella review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidance, and its reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews statement. The search was carried out in the databases Medline®, CINAHL®, Scopus®, SciELO®, Web of Science®, Cochrane®, and SportDiscus®, using both indexed terms specific to each database and free-text terms. To assess the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews, the AMSTAR 2, tool was usedcovering 16 domains related to review design and reporting quality. The search was conducted with no temporal limits, until December 2024. A total of 21 systematic reviews were included. The most frequently assessed outcomes were muscle strength, muscle mass, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Muscle strength was the most extensively investigated outcome, with 11 reviews reporting positive effects. The analysis of primary study overlap revealed a moderate degree of overlap (6.71%). It is concluded that neuromuscular electrical stimulation is safe for critically ill patients, with positive effects on muscle strength, muscle mass, and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Although neuromuscular electrical stimulation demonstrates promising results in the rehabilitation of critically ill patients, the methodological quality of the available systematic reviews is variable. Therefore, there is a need for more robust and high-quality systematic reviews to strengthen the evidence base.

[PMID: 41187371] Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a key member of the BET family, is integral to epigenetic regulation through its recognition of acetylated histones and its modulation of transcriptional programs associated with cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and inflammatory responses. The overexpression of BRD4 has been linked to a diverse array of malignancies, including basal-like breast cancer, melanoma, and epithelial ovarian cancer, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic target. In the past year, significant advancements have been made in the development of novel agents targeting BRD4, particularly selective inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which demonstrate enhanced efficacy and specificity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the functions and underlying mechanisms of BRD4 in oncogenesis. It further highlights the recent progress in the development of BRD4-directed inhibitors and degraders in the past year. Additionally, the review discusses emerging mechanisms of resistance to BRD4-targeted therapies and explores rational combination strategies to mitigate such resistance. The objective of this overview is to offer timely and insightful information that may facilitate the advancement of more effective epigenetic therapies targeting BRD4-dependent cancers.

[PMID: 41187364] Threat perception is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, shaped by evolutionary pressures and modern environmental demands. While ancestral threats (e.g., snakes) have been shown to elicit stronger neural responses than modern threats (e.g., guns), less is known about how the brain processes airborne threats, such as depictions of individuals wearing face masks. This fMRI study investigates neural responses to ancestral, modern, and airborne threats to identify shared and distinct activation patterns. Sixty participants viewed visual stimuli from the three categories while undergoing fMRI scanning. Results showed heightened activation in the fear-processing network for all affective stimuli. In addition, activation of the ventral attention network was found for the ancestral threats. Modern threats elicited less intense responses, primarily engaging cortical regions associated with context-specific analysis. Notably, airborne threats elicited neural responses of similar intensity to ancestral threats but activated cortical regions overlapping with those for modern threats. This dual pattern highlights the brain's capacity to integrate evolutionary biases with socially constructed threat awareness. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing airborne threats as a unique category of threat processing, with implications for public health and mental well-being.

[PMID: 41187363] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains a major respiratory pathogen of economic concern in the poultry industry. This study investigated the farm-level prevalence of IBV and evaluated associated risk factors in northern Vietnam by a cross-sectional study from June 2022 to June 2024. A total of 69 poultry farms were randomly selected across nine provinces, and pooled tracheal swab samples were purposively collected for IBV detection using RT-qPCR. The overall IBV farm-level prevalence was 34.78 % (95 % CI:23.71-47.21 %). Although no statistically significant differences were found across provinces, production types, age groups, or flock sizes, IBV was detected in all subgroups, indicating widespread circulation of the virus. A total of 22 potential risk factors were initially assessed using univariate logistic regression. Of these, six variables with P < 0.1, including farm size, number of poultry houses, presence of multiple age groups, vaccination at day-old, frequency of disinfection before chick placement, and proximity to live bird markets and residential areas, were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model retained two independent predictors: performing more than one disinfection before chick placement (P = 0.035), and administration of a live IB vaccine at one day of age (P = 0.006), both of which were significantly associated with reduced the odds of IBV infection at the farm level. These findings suggest that strategic vaccination and careful calibration of disinfection protocols are critical to minimizing IBV transmission at the farm level.

[PMID: 41187361] To explore the mechanism of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa on the accumulation of γ-glutamyl peptides and taste development in Jinhua ham, the influences of R. mucilaginosa on fungal community structure, functional enzyme gene expression, key enzyme activities, γ-glutamyl peptides accumulation and taste attributes were investigated during the dry-ripening. In comparison with Pichia kudriavzevii XS-5 (PK), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa XZY63-3 (RX) and no inoculation (CK), the inoculation with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa EIODSF019 (RE) showed the highest overall acceptance and richness. Metagenomics revealed that RE inoculation inhibited Aspergillus abundance, and the profile of Rhodotorula reached 45.94 % at genus level. The treatment of RE increased the gene abundance of amino acid metabolism pathways; the expression levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase gene in RE were increased by 83.27 % compared with CK, and the activities of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase increased from 214 U/g proteins of CK to 567 U/g proteins of RE. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the total contents of γ-glutamyl peptides increased from 136.40 μg/g of CK to 518.18 μg/g of RE. Partial least squares regression and correlation analysis indicated that γ-Glu-Cys and γ-Glu-Gln were mainly responsible for the improvement of overall acceptance and richness of Jinhua ham with RE inoculation.

[PMID: 41187357] To examine relationships among caregiver burden, parenting competence, and related factors in parents providing home-based care for children with medical complexity. We used a descriptive correlational, cross-sectional design and conducted path analysis. Convenience sampling was employed via pediatric visiting nurse stations in Kyoto and Shiga, Japan. Self-administered questionnaires were returned by 91 parents. The short version of the Japanese version of the Zarit Burden Interview and the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale were used. Analyses were performed in SPSS v29 and AMOS v29. After assessing all variable correlations, a path analysis was conducted to examine the direct and indirect effects of caregiver burden, parenting satisfaction, self-efficacy, and related variables. Caregiver burden negatively influenced parenting satisfaction (β = -0.383, p < .001) and was associated with inadequate rest (β = -0.271, p = .006) and shorter sleep duration (β = -0.228, p = .021). Higher medical complexity scores predicted greater parenting satisfaction (β = 0.202, p = .024) but were correlated with providing nighttime care (r = 0.275, p < .001), which reduced sleep duration. Model fit was adequate (goodness-of-fit index = 0.879; comparative fit index = 0.918; root mean square error of approximation = 0.043). Caregiver burden was a key factor affecting parenting competence among parents. Interventions aimed at reducing caregiver burden, such as facilitating adequate sleep and rest, may enhance their parenting competence. Future studies should recruit larger and more diverse samples and use longitudinal designs to increase generalizability and clarify temporal relationships.",10
NR5A2 does not play a role in development of endometrial tissues.,NR5A2 AND NR5A2 function AND endometrial tissue development AND no role,"26717016,41187384,41187379,41187366,41187354,41187348,41187343,41187328,41187314,41187303","[PMID: 26717016] Preeclampsia (PE) is a multisystem disorder unique to Homo sapiens that is known to cause maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Between 5-7% of all pregnancies are affected by PE and it is responsible for approximately 50,000 maternal deaths annually. The pathogenesis of PE remains poorly understood. However, the results of this study indicated that insufficient decidualization plays a significant role. NR5A1 and NR5A2 are orphan members of the Ftz-F1 subfamily of nuclear receptors and are involved in mammal follicular development, female reproduction, steroidogenesis, and decidualization. The expression of NR5A1 and NR5A2 in the human decidua and their functions during decidualization were investigated using in vitro cultured cells by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and siRNA techniques. The results demonstrated that the levels of NR5A2 mRNA and protein in the decidual tissues of women with PE were lower than those of normal pregnant women. However, the levels of NR5A1 mRNA and protein did not significantly differ between groups. The expression of NR5A2 was upregulated after in vitro decidualization, but the expression of NR5A1 remained low and showed no difference compared with that of the control cells. Knocking down of NR5A2 in human endometrial stromal cells (hESC) resulted in a significant reduction in their expression of decidualization markers (IGFBP1 and PRL) and signaling pathway molecules (WNT4 and BMP2) (P < 0.05). From these data, we concluded that NR5A2 is pivotal for the decidualization of decidual tissues and cultured human endometrial stromal cells. Disorders of the endometrium in decidual tissues may be associated with the abnormal decidualization thought to cause PE.

[PMID: 41187384] Treatment for gaming disorder (GD) can be challenging due to comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of interventions for GD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacological, and other approaches (e.g., family therapy, mindfulness-based therapy), and extends past reviews by evaluating GD-specific trials and the role of comorbidity. A pre-registered systematic review identified controlled trials of GD interventions published between 2007 and 2025. Eligible studies (n = 21) used validated GD assessments, included control groups, and reported effect sizes at post-intervention and/or follow-up. The primary outcome was GD symptoms; secondary outcomes included gaming time, depression, and anxiety. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g), with mixed-effects subgroup analyses by comorbidity, intervention type, age, gender, and region. Across 1360 participants, interventions significantly reduced GD symptoms (g = 1.38, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.90, p=.002), with moderate reductions in depression (g = 0.65, p=.001) and anxiety (g = 0.66, p=.001) at post-intervention. Effects were sustained at 90-day follow-up for GD symptoms (g = 1.15, p<.001) and gaming time (g = 0.79, p=.025). CBT and other interventions demonstrated comparable efficacy. Comorbidity did not moderate outcomes. Adolescents displayed larger treatment effects than adults. Heterogeneity between studies was generally high (i.e., I<sup>2</sup>>50 %). The GD treatment literature has methodological limitations including inconsistent diagnostic approaches, relatively short follow-ups, and high between-studies heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests treatment can effectively reduce symptoms and gaming time, with sustained benefits at follow-up, regardless of comorbidity. High heterogeneity suggests larger, longer-term trials are needed. Pharmacological interventions require further study, alone or combined with psychological therapies.

[PMID: 41187379] This study aimed to investigate the effect of the periodontal bacterium Filifactor alocis on proinflammatory cytokine production by osteoblasts. Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187366] The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, primarily through mechanisms involving carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Aberrant FGFR1 signalling has been implicated in various cancers, including lung, breast, neck and urothelial carcinoma. Despite the recognized oncogenic potential of FGFR1, therapeutic strategies targeting its kinase domain remain inadequately explored. This underscores an urgent need for the development of novel FGFR1 inhibitors, particularly through de novo drug design approaches, to effectively counteract FGFR1-driven malignancies. This research aims to develop novel FGFR1 inhibitors through a multi-step approach involving fragment-based drug design, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and density functional theory studies (DFT), with the goal of targeting FGFR1's kinase binding domain to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Initially, known FGFR inhibitor molecules were retrieved and subjected to fragment-based drug designing and virtual screening. Through thorough analysis, molecules containing the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold were identified as promising candidates. A pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based database containing 90,952 molecules was subsequently retrieved from PubChem and filtered using molecular docking-based virtual screening resulting 94 molecules having better binding affinity than derazantinib, reference drug. After pharmacokinetic profiling (ADME), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) studies, out of 94 molecules only 11 compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and superior MM-GBSA binding free energies were selected. Docking-based screening revealed that selected 11 compounds demonstrated better binding scores than the reference drug, derazantinib. Among them, HIT1, was selected for 150ns molecular dynamics simulation to assess its conformational stability. DFT calculations further confirmed its bio-feasibility by analyzing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Overall, the selected lead compounds exhibited enhanced binding affinity, superior conformational stability, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to derazantinib. Present findings suggest that the identified hit molecules hold strong potential for inhibiting FGFR1's kinase domain and disrupting FGFR-associated tumor angiogenesis.

[PMID: 41187354] In recent years, atmospheric pollution has been increasing day by day due to the rapid growth of industrialization, urbanization and motor vehicles. As a result, a large number of pollutants containing harmful and toxic gases like NO2, NH3, H2, H2S and C3H6O etc. are being released into the environment. This detrimental increase can cause adverse effects on human life, necessitating monitoring and safety measures. Gas sensors play a crucial role in this regard by monitoring and alerting when pollutant levels exceed permissible limits. Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors have gained much popularity due to their good stability, tunable chemical properties, simple fabrication process and cost effectiveness. SnO2 is the most widely used MOS material for detecting various toxic and hazardous gases, owing to its excellent physical and chemical properties, high reliability and short adsorption and desorption times. In this review, we elevated the role of SnO2 in detecting various toxic and hazardous gases and highlighting different synthesis methods with various structural and morphological modifications are summarized. By reviewing the latest advancements, this paper proposes several future research directions for SnO2-based gas sensors.

[PMID: 41187348] The Casimir force, an attractive force between two parallel, uncharged, perfectly conducting plates separated by a small gap has attracted much attention not only because it is fascinating phenomenon in quantum electrodynamics, but also because of its important applications in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Although the Casimir force is extremely small, it plays a dominant role in the MEMS when the distance between device components is also very small. The failure of MEMS due to stiction caused by attractive force motivates the study of repulsive Casimir force. As a result, more and more derivative concepts related to the Casimir force have emerged. Aside from the attractive and repulsive Casimir forces, the lateral Casimir force can occur between sinusoidally corrugated surfaces. Casimir friction appears when two plates are in relative motion even if they are not in direct contact. Such phenomena reveals the non-intuitive nature of the quantum vacuum, but also demonstrate potential applications in nanoscience and quantum technology. In addition, a rotating nanoparticle can also experience a lateral Casimir force when it rotates near a plate, the underlying mechanism is different from that occuring between corrugated surfaces. In particular, when the nanoparticle rotates in the proximity of an optical anisotropic plate, an axial Casimir force along the direction of the rotation axis is exerted on the nanoparticle. At present, these novel phenomena related to the Casimir force form the foundation of Casimir physics research. Here, we focus on the recent progress in the theoretical and experimental research on the Casimir effect including the attractive Casimir force, repulsive Casimir force, lateral Casimir force, and Casimir friction. We also review the applications of various Casimir effects in the field of nanotechnology. The Casimir effect provides new perspectives on MEMS and quantum information processing, and may inspire new experimental approaches and technological applications. This phenomenon holds substantial scientific significance and promising application potential across both fundamental research and engineering fields.

[PMID: 41187343] IntroductionMental health in children is significantly influenced by socio-economic status, poverty, and income inequality. However, existing child psychiatric research focuses on clinical variables and developed nations. Hence, this study explored the impact of these factors on the psychosocial functioning of children visiting a mental health clinic in India.MethodsA cross-sectional research design was employed, with data collected from children and their parents/caregivers using the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS). Participants included 120 children recruited from an out-patient clinic in a tertiary mental healthcare center. Non-parametric tests were employed to examine the influence of socio-economic status and poverty on functioning among the participants.ResultsOur study observed significant differences in functioning scores related to socio-economic status, monthly family income, and sources of income, with family income source significantly affecting disability scores. A significant proportion of the participants scored below the functioning benchmark and above the disability benchmark.ConclusionSocio-economic disparities and income inequality significantly influence mental health outcomes. The findings emphasize the role of social determinants of mental health and underscore the importance of integrating mental health services with socio-economic support systems.

[PMID: 41187328] Patient interaction patterns with self-triage modules in mobile health apps during urgent direct-to-consumer telemedicine consultations remain underexplored, despite their critical role in optimizing virtual care pathways. This study aimed to analyze user navigation behaviors within the screen pathways of a symptom-based self-triage mobile app's algorithm during remote urgent care assessments. This observational, retrospective, single-center study analyzed data from users who were aged 18 years and older and who voluntarily sought virtual urgent care through the Einstein Conecta (version 2.0; iOS and Android) at a private Brazilian hospital between May 2022 and December 2023. Patients with incomplete connection records were excluded. User interactions were evaluated based on the number of distinct triage flows accessed per session, the number of screens viewed per flow, the frequency of returns to previous screens, and the time spent within the self-triage module. Descriptive statistical methods were applied for analysis. Data from 62,006 unique users with a mean age of 36.51 (SD 10.53) years, of whom 54.65% (33,889/62,006) were female, were analyzed. They initiated 194,976 self-triage flows. We found that 36.89% (22,875/62,006) of users completed 1 flow per session; 22.15% (13,734/62,006) users accessed 2 flows; and 27.93% (17,317/62,006) users accessed ≥4 flows (maximum 63 flows). Users receiving an initial emergency department referral recommendation were more likely to initiate subsequent flows than those recommended for virtual assessment. Returning to a previous screen was infrequent (used by 5277/62,006, 8% of users). The average time spent in the first flow was 70.95 (SD 65.26) seconds, with an average of 9.51 (SD 12.84) seconds per screen. In this cohort, most users explored alternative pathways beyond the initial self-triage recommendation, particularly when directed to the emergency department, while rarely backtracking within a flow. These findings underscore the need to refine self-triage mechanisms in telemedicine to better align with observed user navigation behaviors and preferences.

[PMID: 41187314] A global aging population seeking resolution of pain and functional decline from degenerative spine conditions is leading to an increasing number of spine surgeries. The recovery process is complex with many cognitive and physical actions performed by the patient, which can be conceptualized as patient work. Shaped by the dynamic patient work system (PWS), patient work is the time and effort patients complete at home and across health settings to meet their health goals. Our aim was to define factors in the PWS that influence the patient work of older adults' recovery during the hospital and posthospitalization phases as well as by discharge location after spine surgery.METHODS: Secondary data analysis (28 interviews) using deductive and inductive qualitative content analysis methods was used to describe PWS influencing factors. The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety 2.0 human factors framework (person, organization, task, tools and technology, and internal and external environments) guided independent (3 members) coding, codebook evolution, and team deductive analysis. Care phase and discharge location were further analyzed using team inductive analysis.RESULTS: In nearly all components, factor differences were present between discharge to home or skilled nursing facility or inpatient rehabilitation. These differences included pain severity, mobility, unexpected experiences, education not meeting their needs, the level of problem-solving required, and types of benchmarks to their goal of recovery.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that regardless of discharge disposition, older adults experience uncertainty and different needs during recovery that often generate invisible work in navigating the recovery process. Participants describe significant work to clarify any uncertainty and meet their recovery needs. Nursing has a pivotal role to further investigate strategies to help patients achieve their recovery goals.

[PMID: 41187303] The reconstruction of perovskite oxides into transition metal oxyhydroxides (MOOH) has reshaped traditional structure-activity paradigms in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. Understanding the structural origins of catalytic activity in reconstruction-derived MOOH is important for rationally optimizing its catalytic activity. Herein, by achieving complete reconstruction of SrCoO<sub>3-δ</sub>, we show that A-site Sr actively participates in the formation of γ-CoOOH through intercalation. To explore the way and extent to which the A-site species can modulate the structure and catalytic performance, Ba is further introduced into the γ-CoOOH interlayer with varying Ba/Sr ratios. The disparity in atomic radius between Ba and Sr induces a local compressive strain in γ-CoOOH, resulting in distortion of the CoO<sub>6</sub> octahedron. This structural distortion could lift the degeneracy of <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub>* orbitals, populating more electronic states around the Fermi level and hence significantly enhancing the electron transfer ability and corresponding OER activity. Consequently, the reconstructed Ba<sub>0.3</sub>Sr<sub>0.7</sub>CoO<sub>3-δ</sub>-h with the strongest <i>t</i><sub>2g</sub>* band broadening exhibits superior OER activity, achieving 4.06 A cm<sup>-2</sup> at 2.0 V in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer device and operating stably at 1 A cm<sup>-2</sup> for more than 200 h. This work highlights the pivotal role of A-site cations in manipulating the reconstruction of perovskite precatalysts and offers a design principle for developing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.",10

In the context of dyslipemia, LRP1 is upregulated in the heart. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of cardiomyocyte LRP1 deficiency on high fat diet (HFD)-induced cardiac and metabolic alterations, and to explore the potential mechanisms involved. We used TnT-iCre transgenic mice with thoroughly tested suitability to delete genes exclusively in cardiomyocytes to generate an experimental mouse model with conditional Lrp1 deficiency in cardiomyocytes (TNT-iCre<sup>+</sup>-LRP1<sup>flox/flox</sup>). Mice with Lrp1-deficient cardiomyocytes (cm-Lrp1<sup>-/-</sup>) have a normal cardiac function combined with a favorable metabolic phenotype against HFD-induced glucose intolerance and obesity. Glucose intolerance protection was linked to higher hepatic fatty acid oxidation (FAO), lower liver steatosis and increased whole-body energy expenditure. Proteomic studies of the heart revealed decreased levels of cardiac pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP), which was parallel to higher ANP circulating levels. cm-Lrp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed ANP signaling activation that was linked to increased fatty acid (FA) uptake and increased AMPK/ ACC phosphorylation in the liver. Natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) antagonist completely abolished ANP signaling and metabolic protection in cm-Lrp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These results indicate that an ANP-dependent axis controlled by cardiac LRP1 levels modulates AMPK activity in the liver, energy homeostasis and whole-body metabolism.

[PMID: 18855224] The common C34T polymorphism in the AMP deaminase-1 (AMPD1) gene results in an inactive enzyme in homozygotes for the mutated T allele. Some studies have shown an association of T allele with longer survival in heart failure (HF) and/or coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to assess genotype-phenotype correlations in such patients, with emphasis on components of the metabolic syndrome. Ninety-seven patients with CAD without HF (CAD+ HF-) and 104 with HF (HF+) were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. The genetic control group comprised 200 newborns. No significant differences were found in the frequency of AMPD1 genotypes between the groups. In the CAD+ HF- group, the carriers of T allele compared to CC homozygotes had significantly lower values of waist circumference (89.5+/-8.5 versus 97.7+/-11.2 cm; p = 0.00029), waist/hip ratio (p = 0.0059) and BMI (p = 0.045). There was no diabetes or fasting glycaemia > or =126 mg/dL in T carriers, while these features were present in 25% of CC homozygotes (p = 0.0024). In the HF+ group, a tendency towards a lower prevalence of diabetes (20 % versus 41%; p = 0.068) and significantly lower systolic blood pressure (p = 0.048) were observed in T allele carriers. C34T AMPD1 polymorphism may be associated with reduced frequency of obesity in CAD patients and of hyperglycaemia and diabetes in both CAD and HF patients. Morphometric parameters associated with adipose tissue distribution and parameters of glucose metabolism should be analysed as potential confounders in further studies on the role of polymorphisms of AMPD1 and other genes associated with AMP and adenosine metabolism in cardiovascular disease.

[PMID: 41187382] Recent research elucidates the complex molecular mechanisms linking adipose tissue (AT) browning to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. Pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 inflammasome, TLR4, and NF-κB, typically inhibit browning, whereas their disruption promotes it. Conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by IL-4, IL-13, and M2 macrophages stimulate browning and are associated with enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mitochondrial regulation is central to this process, with UCP-1 and PGC1-α as key effectors. Interventions like ASK-1 knockout, nitrate, and melatonin have increased thermogenesis and improved metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. A limited number of studies directly measuring cardiovascular endpoints report improved endothelial function, reduced hypertension, reduced atherosclerotic plaque inflammation with attenuated atherosclerosis progression and decreased liver steatosis, suggesting significant cardioprotective potential. However, most evidence remains preclinical, derived from in vitro and animal studies. Interpretations are complicated by context-dependent effects, such as variable responses in IL-6 signaling. The current literature indicates that white AT browning mitigates inflammation and improves cardiometabolic health through multiple pathways that include key atherosclerosis-related risk factors; direct clinical confirmation is needed. Future research should prioritize human validation of preclinical findings to determine sex-specific responses, identify target patient populations, particularly those at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and develop AT-targeted therapies with fewer off-target cardiovascular and systemic adverse effects.

[PMID: 41187128] The autonomic nervous system (ANS) dynamically regulates the internal environment to maintain homeostasis. The ANS exhibits some forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and plastic changes in neurotransmitter distribution, both of which may contribute to autonomic function. Dysautonomia refers to an abnormality in the function of the ANS, with an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Dysautonomia has been reported in conditions such as stress, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and premature death. In MS, the signs of dysautonomia include elevated plasma norepinephrine levels and increased arterial blood pressure. In this study, we characterized the effect of a high-sucrose diet (HSD) on synaptic plasticity in sympathetic ganglia of the rat by measuring LTP expression in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and analyzing the expression of acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA, as well as their balance of colocalization/segregation in ganglionic nerve terminals. The HSD consists of adding 30% sucrose to drinking water, which is an accepted model of MS. We observed an impairment in LTP expression, along with a decrease in ACh presence and a reduction in its segregation from GABA. These findings suggest the emergence of an inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission and plasticity within the SCG. We propose that dysautonomia associated with MS might involve changes in sympathetic activity, at least at the level of ganglionic cholinergic transmission. These results may help to improve our understanding of autonomic dysfunction in the context of this metabolic disorder.

[PMID: 41187060] Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) represent a promising therapeutic resource, yet their immunometabolic regulation remains poorly defined. Here, we reveal a tunneling nanotube (TNT)-mediated communication mechanism between ADSCs and adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) that maintains metabolic homeostasis during pregnancy. Using gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mouse models combined with live-cell imaging, scanning electron microscope, and multi-omics approaches, we demonstrate that mitochondrial transfer from ADSCs to ATMs via TNTs sustains ATM metabolic fitness. This process is governed by the WNT5A-RhoA-ROCK1 axis and becomes impaired under metabolic stress, driving ATMs inflammatory polarization and insulin resistance. Importantly, in situ ADSC administration restores mitochondrial transfer and improves metabolic parameters in GDM mice. Collectively, our work establishes TNT-mediated organelle sharing as a fundamental mechanism of stem cell-immune interaction and demonstrates that ADSC-based therapy represents a promising strategy for GDM by reprogramming the metabolism of immune cells.

[PMID: 41186995] The present study aims to explore the role and possible underlying mechanisms of histone lactylation modifications in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment (DACD). In this study, behavioral tests, Hematoxylin & Eosin (HE) staining, and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate cognitive function and the extent of cerebral tissue injury. We quantified the levels of lactic acid and Pan-lysine lactylation (Pan Kla) in the brains of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice and in high glucose-treated microglia. We also identified all Kla sites in isolated microglia. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were subsequently conducted to identify the functions and pathways that were enriched at the differentially expressed modification sites. cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) technology was used to identify candidate genes that are regulated by H3K18la. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and H3K18R mutant sequences were used to knock down crucial components in key signaling pathways to assess the effects of histone lactylation on microglial polarization. We found that lactic acid levels were significantly greater in the brains of T2DM mice and high glucose-treated microglia than in those of their corresponding controls, which increased the level of Pan-Kla. We discovered that lactate can directly stimulate an increase in H3K18la. The global landscape of the lactylome reveals information about modification sites, indicating a correlation between the upregulation of H3K18la and protein lactylation and Toll-like receptor signaling. CUT&Tag demonstrated that enhanced H3K18la directly stimulates the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway by increasing binding to the promoter of Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), thereby promoting M1 microglial polarization. The present study demonstrated that enhanced H3K18la directly stimulates TLR4 signaling to promote M1 microglial polarization, thereby facilitating DACD phenotypes. Targeting such loop may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of DACD.

[PMID: 41186777] Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis involves apoptosis, inflammation, lipogenesis, and insulin resistance. Hepatocyte apoptosis leads to liver injury and fibrosis, while inflammation exacerbates damage through immune cells and cytokines. Lipogenesis promotes fat accumulation and lipotoxicity, stressing hepatocytes, whereas insulin resistance impairs glucose metabolism and exacerbates dysfunction. Highlight the complexity of NASH and the need for multi-targeted therapies are highlighted by these interrelated processes. Using in silico transcriptomic analysis, this study identifies key microRNAs (miRNAs) in NASH and explores the relationship between miRNAs and circ-MYO9B in NASH. To find differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), miRNA expression profiles from the liver and blood datasets (GSE33857, GSE59492, and GSE49012) were examined. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced cirrhosis (NASH-CH)-related miRNA modules were discovered by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). RT-qPCR was used on tissue and blood samples to examine the expression and interaction of circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p in NASH patients, and dual-luciferase assays confirmed their direct interaction. Circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p were found to be significantly correlated in both blood and liver tissue in NASH-CH patients, according to expression analysis. RT-qPCR analysis validated their dysregulation, suggesting their role in the advancement of the disease. The direct interaction between circ-MYO9B and hsa-miR-193b-5p was confirmed by the dual-luciferase assay, indicating a regulatory function in metabolic pathways. By modulating this miRNA, circ-MYO9B may influence downstream pathways in which miR-193b-5p is known to be involved, such as lipogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that circ-MYO9B may represent a potential therapeutic target for addressing metabolic dysfunction associated with NASH, although further validation in hepatocyte-specific models is warranted.

[PMID: 41186757] Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a significant pulmonary disorder that often leads to prolonged respiratory complications in preterm infants. This study aimed to characterize the lipidomic profiles in the tracheal aspirate (TA) of extremely preterm infants to identify specific lipid signatures associated with the development of BPD. This study involved 7 infants with BPD and 10 extremely preterm infants without BPD. TA samples were obtained at intubation from the non-BPD infants and at intubation as well as 7 days post-intubation from the BPD infants. Untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed to characterize the lipidomic signatures of TA. A total of 1189 lipid compounds were identified in the TA of infants with BPD and without BPD, with 298 significantly different lipid metabolites between the two groups at intubation. Notably, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were significantly decreased, while triglycerides, ceramides, phosphorylated fatty acid analogs, and diglycerides were significantly increased in the infants with BPD. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of differential lipids in pathways related to insulin resistance, vitamin digestion and absorption, lipolysis regulation in adipocytes, glycerolipid metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, and cholesterol metabolism. After intubation, infants with BPD exhibited 26 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated lipid metabolites, with enrichment primarily in metabolic pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism and autophagy.  This study identified distinct lipidomic alterations in the TA of BPD infants, suggesting the potential of these lipid profiles as early diagnostic biomarkers and as therapeutic intervention targets. • BPD is a serious pulmonary complication in preterm infants. Lipid synthesis and metabolism are vital for normal lung development. • Distinct lipidomic profiles in tracheal aspirate differentiate infants with and without BPD. • Tracheal aspirate lipid profiles show strong potential as novel early diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for BPD.",10

[PMID: 41185081] Optimizing mechanical ventilation in patients with acute brain injury (ABI) presents a complex clinical challenge, requiring a delicate balance between minimizing secondary cerebral injury and preventing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The intricate interplay between respiratory and cerebral physiology mandates an individualized approach to ventilatory management. Core goals include maintaining normoxia and normocapnia to avert cerebral ischemia from hypoxia or hypocapnia while avoiding intracranial hypertension associated with hypercapnia. However, evidence guiding the ideal tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings in this population remains limited, particularly regarding their impact on cerebral perfusion pressure and oxygen delivery. Advanced neuromonitoring modalities-such as transcranial Doppler ultrasound and brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO₂) monitoring-offer critical real-time data to inform ventilation strategies. Additionally, emerging technologies, including automated and adaptive modes of ventilation, show promise in enhancing patient-ventilator synchrony and gas exchange. This narrative review synthesizes current physiological principles, discusses the challenges inherent in protecting both the brain and lungs, and explores the evolving role of precision ventilation strategies supported by multimodal monitoring. Integrating these approaches may improve neurological and respiratory outcomes and help close the evidence gaps in ABI management.

[PMID: 41184594] Pulmonary fibrotic changes (FC) following COVID-19-related ARDS represent a significant concern due to the potential respiratory complications. The identification of early predictive factors for FC and the development of predictive tools are needed to optimize patient management and outcomes. This observational prospective multicentre study is a substudy of the RECOVIDS study and included 32 centres in France and Belgium. COVID-19 ARDS survivors were included if they met the Berlin ARDS criteria or if they received high flow oxygen therapy (flow ≥ 50 L/min and FiO<sub>2</sub> ≥ 50%). Exclusion criteria were non-attendance at follow-up 6 ± 1 months after ICU discharge, lack of baseline or follow-up chest CT, and history of interstitial lung disease. The primary endpoint was presence of FC at follow-up CT. The secondary outcome was to identify predominant radiological patterns. Among 555 patients included in the RECOVIDS study, 440 were analysed, of whom 162 (36.8%) had FC at follow-up. Predictive factors for FC included older age, body mass index < 30, Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 1, invasive mechanical ventilation, early signs of FC, and greater lung involvement on baseline CT. The nomogram for predicting pulmonary FC yielded an AUC of 80.6% (95%CI (76.4-84.8)). Late organizing pneumonia was the most common pattern overall and 30 (18.5%) of the 162 patients with FC presented mainly anterior fibrosis compatible with post ventilatory changes. In this large cohort of COVID-19 ARDS survivors, 36.8% exhibited FC at 6 months post-ICU discharge. The key predictors identified here could guide therapeutic and follow-up strategies.

[PMID: 41184244] The Hippo pathway plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and cancer occurrence. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) is a key effector molecule of Hippo pathway. Previous studies have found abnormal YAP overexpression in many solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we attempt to explore the cancer-promoting mechanism of YAP in HCC. The target gene of Hippo-YAP pathway, Four and a half LIM domain protein 3 (FHL3), was screened by spontaneous hydrodynamic tumor model with YAP participation and two publicly HCC microarray sets. Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemical (IHC) showed high protein levels of FHL3 in tumor tissues and the expression of FHL3 was associated with poorer prognosis. The biological effect experiments showed that FHL3 significantly promoted the progression of HCC. FHL3 interacted with MYC-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) to recruit MAZ binding to the G-quadruplexes (G4s) structure, which promoted Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS) transcription and activation of its downstream signal. Down-regulating KRAS expression inhibited the promoting effect of YAP-FHL3 signaling on HCC. In addition, transactivation of FHL3 mediated by YAP was verified by luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). FHL3 knockdown inhibited the tumor-promoting effect of YAP and significantly delayed the tumorigenesis and progression caused by YAP. Finally, clinical data validated the correlation between YAP, FHL3, and KRAS expression. In conclusion, we identified a new target of Hippo-YAP signaling, FHL3, which interacts with MAZ to promote KRAS transcription and downstream oncogenic signaling pathway activation, thereby promoting HCC progression.

[PMID: 41183953] This study focused on ventilatory management during robot-assisted laparoscopic rectal resection in an obese patient, using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to evaluate lung conditions. The case involved a 40s male with a history of smoking, obesity (BMI:31), and iodine allergy. General anesthesia was induced, and EIT was employed to assess positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during different surgical positions. The study found that the PEEP for supine positioning was 10-12 cmH2O for ventilatory conditions in which the anterior and posterior impedance changes were equal in patients, but during pneumoperitoneum and head lowering, a higher PEEP of 20 cmH2O was necessary to prevent lung collapse. This differed from conventional recommendations. Oxygenation was maintained, and the patient had no major complications. The study suggests that EIT may offer a noninvasive and bedside approach to evaluating ventilator settings, potentially changing perspectives on intraoperative ventilator management. J. Med. Invest. 72 : 447-450, August, 2025.

[PMID: 41181863] Individuals with Parkinson's disease may be more susceptible to severe coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 outcomes due to advanced age and neurological and systemic impairments. However, the evidence on this association remains inconclusive. This study investigates the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in hospitalized patients with Parkinson's disease. Secondary data from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System were obtained from the OpenData-SUS platform of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, covering March 2020 to March 2024. Variables included demographics, comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, ventilatory and intensive care unit (ICU) support, hospital stay, and outcomes. Missing data were imputed, and descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable analyses were conducted using 5% significance level. Among 1 725 690 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Brazil, 4907 (0.3%) had Parkinson's disease. Overall mortality was 37.2%, while mortality among Parkinson's patients reached 53.1% (OR = 1.920; 95% CI = 1.815-2.031), indicating a significantly higher risk. Death was independently associated with advanced age, male sex, low vaccination coverage, and cardiovascular or chronic respiratory diseases. Age strongly predicted both Parkinson's diagnosis and mortality. Parkinson's patients had higher ICU admission rates and more frequent need for invasive ventilation. Multivariable analysis confirmed Parkinson's disease as an independent mortality risk factor (OR = 1.277; 95% CI = 1.198-1.360). The logistic regression model for mortality demonstrated good discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.810 (95% CI = 0.809-0.811), indicating reliable performance in distinguishing patients who experienced the outcome. Parkinson's disease is associated with higher mortality and greater ICU needs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings underscore the need for targeted prevention, close monitoring, and tailored clinical management for this vulnerable group, especially considering their age and comorbid conditions.

[PMID: 41181767] A 76-year-old man with a history of liver cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), secondary adrenal insufficiency, and psychiatric comorbidities presented with severe weight loss and laboratory findings of pancytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and IgG-predominant hypergammaglobulinemia, raising suspicion for multiple myeloma. However, serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and urinary Bence Jones testing showed no monoclonal protein, and the kappa/lambda (κ/λ) ratio remained normal, indicating polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Further evaluation revealed decompensated liver cirrhosis with hypersplenism, secondary adrenal insufficiency, severe obstructive ventilatory defect from COPD, and nutritional deficiencies. Management included nutritional supplementation, infection control, diuretics, hydrocortisone replacement, and branched-chain amino acids, leading to gradual improvement and discharge with preserved daily function. This case illustrates how multimorbidity, malnutrition, and disuse can mimic malignant conditions, producing hypergammaglobulinemia and weight loss through chronic systemic inflammation. It emphasizes the importance of considering non-malignant causes, especially in frail older patients, and highlights the need for a comprehensive diagnostic and management approach that integrates chronic disease care, nutritional support, and community-based interprofessional collaboration.

[PMID: 41181765] Background Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders were commonly used in patients with severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with variation across different healthcare settings. We evaluated the practices of DNR orders in patients with severe COVID-19 at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 who required ICU admission in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between March and December 2020. We compared patients with DNR orders during ICU stay to those without and described their clinical condition on the day of DNR order implementation. Results Among 470 patients (median age 62.0 years, 348 (74.0%) were males, 207 (44.0%) used high-flow nasal cannula and/or noninvasive ventilation without intubation, and 263 (56.0%) needed intubation), 30.6% (N = 144) received DNR orders after a median of 10 days in the ICU. Patients with DNR orders were older and had more comorbidities. On the DNR order day, 126 patients (87.5%) were on invasive mechanical ventilation (median fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.80), 84 (58.3%) were on vasopressors, and 42 (29.2%) were on renal replacement therapy. The median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 13. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (odds ratio (OR) per one-year increase, 1.052) and intubation (OR, 3.757) were associated with DNR orders. The hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with DNR orders (133/144 (92.4%) vs. 61/326 (18.7%), p < 0.0001). Conclusions DNR orders were commonly used in patients with severe COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, typically after one week of ICU admission. Key predictors were older age and persistent organ failure.

[PMID: 41181736] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis represent severe and often life-threatening conditions, especially in critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities. This case report details the management of a 59-year-old male patient with a complicated medical history, including ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acutely decompensated heart failure (HF) and subsequent sepsis, leading to ARDS. His treatment involved initiating continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using the oXiris filter (Baxter International Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA), known for its ability to adsorb cytokines. The oXiris filter was employed as part of a multifaceted approach to manage the patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) in the context of septic shock and a cytokine storm. Remarkably, no adverse effects were noted, and the patient demonstrated clinical improvement. This case supports the feasibility and safety of using CRRT with the oXiris filter in septic patients with AKI and a cytokine storm, providing an effective adjunctive treatment strategy. This technique may offer potential benefits in managing critically ill patients with complex comorbid conditions, highlighting its possible role in improving outcomes for similar clinical scenarios.

[PMID: 41181652] Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a prevalent acute coronary syndrome among the elderly, a population often underrepresented in clinical trials. Frailty, a marker of physiologic vulnerability, may influence the risks and benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in these patients. To evaluate the impact of frailty status on in-hospital outcomes among patients aged ≥ 75 years with NSTEMI undergoing PCI. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the 2021-2022 National Inpatient Sample to evaluate the impact of frailty on in-hospital outcomes among NSTEMI patients aged ≥ 75 years undergoing PCI. Patients were stratified into three frailty categories using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score. Multivariable logistic and generalized linear models with interaction terms assessed the association between frailty and clinical outcomes. Among 456690 NSTEMI admissions, 37.95%, 50.71%, and 11.34% were categorized as low, intermediate, and high frailty, respectively. PCI use declined with increasing frailty (35.0% in low <i>vs</i> 7.5% in high; <i>P</i> < 0.001). Adjusted mortality was lower with PCI across all frailty levels [odds ratios (OR): 0.27 (low), 0.37 (intermediate), 0.43 (high); all <i>P</i> < 0.001]. However, the mortality benefit was attenuated with increasing frailty (interaction OR: 1.56 and 1.83 for intermediate and high <i>vs</i> low frailty; <i>P</i> < 0.001). Frailty was independently associated with higher odds of complications, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, delirium, and bleeding. PCI was associated with shorter hospital stays in low (-0.90 days) but longer in the high-frail category (+2.47 days; <i>P</i> < 0.001), and increasing frailty correlated with significantly higher hospital charges. In elderly NSTEMI patients, PCI conferred a survival benefit across all frailty strata, although with a diminishing magnitude as frailty increased. Frailty correlated with increased complications and healthcare resource utilization.",10
Nonsteroidal antinflammatory drugs are ineffective as cancer treatments.,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs AND Cancer treatment AND Ineffective AND Anticancer effects,"39834258,37998354,37156929,34371895,34234410,33040178,32329700,32292109,32061771,31584382","[PMID: 39834258] Existing chemotherapeutic approaches against refractory cancers are ineffective due to off-target effects, inefficient delivery, and inadequate accumulation of anticancer drugs at the tumor site, which causes limited efficiency of drug treatment and toxicity to neighboring healthy cells. The development of nano-based drug delivery systems (DDSs) with the goal of delivering desired therapeutic doses to the diseased cells and has already proven to be a promising strategy to address these challenges. Our study focuses on achieving an efficient tumor-targeted delivery of a combination of drugs for therapeutic benefits by developing a versatile DDS by following a simple one-step chemical approach. We used low-molecular-weight chitosan and modified its primary amine groups with reactive forms of cholesterol and folic acid by simple chemical tools and thus prepared folic acid-chitosan-cholesterol graft copolymer. The polymer contains numerous residual primary amine groups, which offer enough water solubility and positive charge to its polymeric backbone to foster the interaction of negatively charged and/or hydrophobic drugs to load and encapsulate a wide variety of drugs within it <i>via</i> various non-bonding interactions. We used curcumin and doxorubicin as the combination of drugs and thus finally prepared targeted nanoconjugates (targeted NCs). <i>In vitro</i> cellular experiments show that our developed targeted NCs demonstrate 3-5 times higher cellular uptake than non-targeted NCs at various incubation times (2 h, 8 h, and 12 h) in KB cells where folate receptors are overexpressed. This enhanced cellular uptake of targeted NCs and the following delivery of drugs in the cytosol and its disposition to the nucleus exhibit a substantial amount of toxicity to KB cells towards an effective therapeutic strategy for treatment.

[PMID: 37998354] The semisynthetic derivatives MePip-SF5 and isogarcinol, which are aligned with the natural products curcumin and garcinol, were tested for their antitumor effects in a preclinical model of pulmonary melanoma metastasis. MePip-SF5 was almost five times more effective in inhibiting B16F10 melanoma cell proliferation than its original substance of curcumin (IC<sub>50</sub> MePip-SF5 2.8 vs. 13.8 µM). Similarly, the melanoma cytotoxicity of isogarcinol was increased by 40% compared to garcinol (IC<sub>50</sub> 3.1 vs. 2.1 µM). The in vivo toxicity of both drugs was assessed in healthy C57BL/6 mice challenged with escalating doses. Isogarcinol induced toxicity above a dose of 15 mg/kg, while MePip-SF5 showed no in vivo toxicity up to 60 mg/kg. Both drugs were tested in murine pulmonary metastatic melanoma. C57BL/6 mice (<i>n</i> = 10) received 500,000 B16F10 melanoma cells intravenously. After intraperitoneal injection of MePip-SF5 (60 mg/kg) or isorgarcinol (15 mg/kg) at days 8, 11 and 14 and sacrifice at day 16, the MePip-SF5-treated mice showed a significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) lower pulmonary macroscopic and microscopic tumor load than the vehicle-treated controls, whereas isogarcinol was ineffective. The pulmonary RNA levels of the mitosis marker Bub1 and the inflammatory markers <i>TNFα</i> and <i>Ccl3</i> were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) reduced in the MePip-SF5-treated mice. Both drugs were well tolerated, as shown by an organ inspection and normal liver- and kidney-related serum parameters. The novel curcuminoid MePip-SF5 showed a convincing antimetastatic effect and a lack of systemic toxicity in a relevant preclinical model of metastasized melanoma.

[PMID: 37156929] Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third broadly identified cancer in the world. The ineffectiveness of colorectal cancer treatment is redundantly reported. Natural bioactive compounds have gained popularity in reducing the drawback of conventional anti-cancer agents. Curcumin (Cur) and Artemisinin (Art) are materials of a natural source that have been utilized to treat numerous kinds of cancers. Although the benefits of bioactive materials, their utilization is limited because of poor solubility, bioavailability, and low dispersion rate in aqueous media. Nano delivery system such as niosome can improve the bioavailability and stability of bioactive compounds within the drug. In current work, we used Cur-Art co-loaded niosomal nanoparticles (Cur-Art NioNPs) as an anti-tumor factor versus colorectal cancer cell line. The synthesized formulations were characterized using dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, and FTIR. The proliferation ability of the cells and expression of apoptosis-associated gene were MTT assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. Cur-Art NioNPs exhibited well distributed with an encapsulation efficiency of 80.27% and 85.5% for Cur and Art. The NioNPs had good release and degradation properties, and had no negative effect on the survival and proliferation ability of SW480 cells. Importantly, nanoformulation form of Cur and Art significantly displayed higher toxicity effect against SW480 cells. Furthermore, Cur-Art NioNPs increased Bax, Fas, and p53 gene expressions and suppressed Bcl2, Rb, and Cyclin D 1 gene expressions. In summary, these results display the niosome NPs as a first report of nano-combinational application of the natural herbal substances with a one-step fabricated co-delivery system for effective colorectal cancer.

[PMID: 34371895] Curcumin, a natural polyphenol and the principal bioactive compound in <i>Curcuma longa</i>, was reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic and anti-rheumatic activity. Curcumin is not only considered for preventive, but also for therapeutic, purposes in cancer therapy, which requires a killing effect on cancer cells. A drawback, however, is the low bioavailability of curcumin due to its insolubility in water. To circumvent this limitation, curcumin was administered in different water-soluble formulations, including liposomes or embedded into nanoscaled micelles. The high uptake rate of micellar curcumin makes it attractive also for cancer therapeutic strategies. Native curcumin solubilised in organic solvent was previously shown to be cytotoxic and bears a genotoxic potential. Corresponding studies with micellar curcumin are lacking. We compared the cytotoxic and genotoxic activity of native curcumin solubilised in ethanol (Cur-E) with curcumin embedded in micells (Cur-M). We measured cell death by MTT assays, apoptosis, necrosis by flow cytometry, senolysis by MTT and C12FDG and genotoxicity by FPG-alkaline and neutral singe-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Using a variety of primary and established cell lines, we show that Cur-E and Cur-M reduce the viability in all cell types in the same dose range. Cur-E and Cur-M induced dose-dependently apoptosis, but did not exhibit senolytic activity. In the cytotoxic dose range, Cur-E and Cur-M were positive in the alkaline and the neutral comet assay. Genotoxic effects vanished upon removal of curcumin, indicating efficient and complete repair of DNA damage. For inducing cell death, which was measured 48 h after the onset of treatment, permanent exposure was required while 60 min pulse-treatment was ineffective. In all assays, Cur-E and Cur-M were equally active, and the concentration above which significant cytotoxic and genotoxic effects were observed was 10 µM. Micelles not containing curcumin were completely inactive. The data show that micellar curcumin has the same cytotoxicity and genotoxicity profile as native curcumin. The effective concentration on different cell lines, including primary cells, was far above the curcumin concentration that can be achieved systemically in vivo, which leads us to conclude that native curcumin and curcumin administered as food supplement in a micellar formulation at the ADI level are not cytotoxic/genotoxic, indicating a wide margin of safety.

[PMID: 34234410] Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). However, current GBM treatments are ineffective, signifying the great importance of exploring new therapeutic targets. Curcumin has been found to be a natural compound with an anticancer potential. However, its targets and mechanisms in GBM are still unclear. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from the GBM dataset in the GEO database and intersected with the target genes of curcumin to select potential target genes. Subsequently, survival analysis was performed with the GEPIA database to confirm the effect of target genes on the prognosis of GBM, and functional enrichment analysis was performed using the DAVID database. In vitro, CCK-8 assay was used to screen the appropriate concentration of curcumin; scratch and transwell invasion assays were used to evaluate the effect of curcumin on the migration and invasion abilities of GBM cells. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to detect changes in target genes and flow cytometry was used to assess the apoptosis level. A total of 16 target genes of curcumin and GBM were obtained, among which <i>ENO1, MMP2</i>, and <i>PRKD2</i> significantly affected the prognosis (<i>P</i> < 0.05). We further selected <i>ENO1</i> for functional enrichment analysis and found that it was enriched in the glycolytic pathway. Meanwhile, in vitro experiments showed that curcumin could inhibit the migration and invasion of U251 cells and promote apoptosis (<i>P</i> < 0.05). <i>ENO1</i> could be a possible target for curcumin in the suppression of GBM cells.

[PMID: 33040178] The naturally-occurring omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is safe, well-tolerated and inexpensive, making it an attractive anti-cancer intervention. However, EPA has only modest anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) activity, when used alone. Both cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms metabolise EPA and are over-expressed in CRC cells. We investigated whether COX inhibition increases the sensitivity of CRC cells to growth inhibition by EPA. A panel of 18 human and mouse CRC cell lines was used to characterize the differential sensitivity of CRC cells to the growth inhibitory effects of EPA. The effect of CRISPR-Cas9 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 on the anti-cancer activity of EPA was determined using in vitro and in vivo models. Genetic ablation of both COX isoforms increased sensitivity of CT26 mouse CRC cells to growth inhibition by EPA in vitro and in vivo. The non-selective COX inhibitor aspirin and the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib increased sensitivity of several human and mouse CRC cell lines to EPA in vitro. However, in a MC38 mouse CRC cell tumour model, with dosing that mirrored low-dose aspirin use in humans, thereby producing significant platelet COX-1 inhibition, there was ineffective intra-tumoral COX-2 inhibition by aspirin and no effect on EPA sensitivity of MC38 cell tumours. Cyclooxygenase inhibition by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs represents a therapeutic opportunity to augment the modest anti-CRC activity of EPA. However, intra-tumoral COX inhibition is likely to be critical for this drug-nutrient interaction and careful tissue pharmacodynamic profiling is required in subsequent pre-clinical and human studies.

[PMID: 32329700] Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide. Despite several advances made in the treatment strategies, the cure for cancer remains still a challenge. Currently used treatment modalities pose several side effects and remain ineffective in the later stages. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have been shown to possess anti-cancer activity in several in vitro models. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of novel synthesized thiazolidinedione derivatives on three selected cancer cell lines viz., human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and colorectal carcinoma (HT29). This study also aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and DNA binding activity of the synthesized derivatives. The synthesized thiazolidinedione derivatives were screened for their in vitro anti-cancer activity on the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and colorectal carcinoma (HT29) using the Methyl Thaizolyl Tetrazolium (MTT) Assay. They were also evaluated for in vitro antiinflammatory activity using albumin denaturation method, DNA binding activity and hemocompatibility. Compounds 5a, 5b, 5d, 6c and 6d showed IC50 of 30.19, 41.56, 65.97, 60.16 and 50.41μM respectively on breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), IC50 of 49.75, 51.42, 65.43, 61.94 and 56.80μM on lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and 38.11, 45.58, 71.24, 53.15 and 51.25μM on colorectal carcinoma (HT29). In the hemolysis assay, compounds 5a and 5b were found to be nontoxic and nonhemolytic to human erythrocytes. Five compounds possessed significant anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity. Three of them are Mannich bases, whereas the remaining two are aryl acyl derivatives. The in vitro results (anticancer and anti-inflammatory) showed that the 4-chloro anilinomethyl substitution at third position and thiophenoethenyl at the fifth position of thiozolidinedione (5a) emerged as the most effective derivative on all the tested cancer cell lines. A higher DNA binding affinity of the test compounds was also found.

[PMID: 32292109] Many dietary polyphenols have been investigated for their therapeutic potential either as single agents or in combinations. Despite the significant anticancer potential of these polyphenols in <i>in vitro</i> cell culture and <i>in vivo</i> animal models, their clinical applications have been limited because of challenges such as ineffective systemic delivery, stability and low bioavailability. Nanoencapsulation of these polyphenols could prolong circulation, improve localization, enhance efficacy and reduce the chances of multidrug resistance. This review summarized the use of various polyphenols especially epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, curcumin and resveratrol as nanoformulations for cancer prevention and treatment. Despite some success, more research is warranted to design a nanoencapsulated combination of polyphenols, effective in <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i> and human systems.

[PMID: 32061771] Pancreatic cancer has poor survival rates and largely ineffective therapies. Aspirin is the prototypical anti-cancer agent but its long-term use is associated with significant side effects. NOSH-aspirin belongs to a new class of anti-inflammatory agents that were designed to be safer alternatives by releasing nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide. In this study we evaluated the effects of NOSH-aspirin against pancreatic cancer using cell lines and a xenograft mouse model. NOSH-aspirin inhibited growth of MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 47 ± 5, and 57 ± 4 nM, respectively, while it did not inhibit growth of a normal pancreatic epithelial cell line at these concentrations. NOSH-aspirin inhibited cell proliferation, caused G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase cycle arrest, leading to increased apoptosis. Treated cells displayed increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 activity. In MIA PaCa-2 cell xenografts, NOSH-aspirin significantly reduced tumor growth and tumor mass. Growth inhibition was due to reduced proliferation (decreased PCNA expression) and induction of apoptosis (increased TUNEL positive cells). Expressions of ROS, iNOS, and mutated p53 were increased; while that of NF-κB and FoxM1 that were high in vehicle-treated xenografts were significantly inhibited by NOSH-aspirin. Taken together, these molecular events and signaling pathways contribute to NOSH-aspirin mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic death of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

[PMID: 31584382] Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal and aggressive human malignancies. Studies have shown that Cancer Stem-Cell (CSC) phenotype is mainly responsible for ATC aggressiveness. Cytostatic compounds are mostly ineffective because of multidrug resistance mechanisms driven by the CSC phenotype. Taxanes have limited efficacy. Recently, CSC inhibition using plant-derived, less toxic compounds, which have anti-cancer efficacy, has become a novel treatment modality. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of two natural compounds (curcumin and deguelin) on ATC cells and their CSC properties. In addition, the efficacies of these compounds were compared with that of docetaxel. Besides control, five treatment groups were formed. ATC cells (CAL-62) were treated with curcumin, deguelin, docetaxel, and their combinations (curcumin+docetaxel, deguelin+docetaxel) at previously determined IC50 doses. Stemness was analyzed by quantitative estimation of sphere formation in matrigel, expression of several cell surface markers (CD133, CD90, Nanog, and OCT3/4) using flow cytometry, and quantification of the hypoxic status [Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity]. The anti-cancer efficacies of these compounds and their combinations were evaluated by determining the alterations in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumoral cell migration. Both the natural compounds (particularly curcumin) significantly suppressed the spheroid formation and cellular motility in matrigel as well as suppressed the accumulation of cells in the G0/1 phase, in which the maximum CSC activity is observed. The compounds did not suppress the expression of CSC markers, but twothirds of the cells expressed CD90. Deguelin was found to be particularly effective in inducing apoptosis similar to docetaxel at IC50 concentrations. Curcumin reduced the OSI and deguelin enhanced the SOD activity, even in docetaxel pre-treated cells. A large proportion of anaplastic tumors might consist of heterogeneous CSC population. Curcumin and deguelin have anti-cancer and several anti-stem cell activities against ATC cells. These natural compounds are capable of altering the aggressive behavior of ATC cells through the inhibition of the CSC phenotype. As a novel therapeutic target, CD90 should be investigated in other ATC cell lines and in vivo models.",10

After initial colonisation, M. abscessus smooth colony (S) variants can undergo an irreversible genetic switch into highly inflammatory, rough colony (R) variants, often associated with a decline in pulmonary function. Here, we use an adult zebrafish model of chronic infection with R and S variants to study M. abscessus pathogenesis in the context of fully functioning host immunity. We show that infection with an R variant causes an inflammatory immune response that drives necrotic granuloma formation through host TNF signalling, mediated by the tnfa, tnfr1 and tnfr2 gene products. T cell-dependent immunity is stronger against the R variant early in infection, and regulatory T cells associate with R variant granulomas and limit bacterial growth. In comparison, an S variant proliferates to high burdens but appears to be controlled by TNF-dependent innate immunity early during infection, resulting in delayed granuloma formation. Thus, our work demonstrates the applicability of adult zebrafish to model persistent M. abscessus infection, and illustrates differences in the immunopathogenesis induced by R and S variants during granulomatous infection.

[PMID: 33465071] Infections by schistosomes result in granulomatous lesions around parasite eggs entrapped within the host tissues. The host and parasite determinants of the Schistosoma mansoni egg-induced granulomatous response are areas of active investigation. Some studies in mice implicate Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) produced in response to the infection whereas others fail to find a role for it. In addition, in the mouse model, the S. mansoni secreted egg antigen omega-1 is found to induce granulomas but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We have recently developed the zebrafish larva as a model to study macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation in response to Schistosoma mansoni eggs. Here we use this model to investigate the mechanisms by which TNF and omega-1 shape the early granulomatous response. We find that TNF, specifically signaling through TNF receptor 1, is not required for macrophage recruitment to the egg and granuloma initiation but does mediate granuloma enlargement. In contrast, omega-1 mediates initial macrophage recruitment, with this chemotactic activity being dependent on its RNase activity. Our findings further the understanding of the role of these host- and parasite-derived factors and show that they impact distinct facets of the granulomatous response to the schistosome egg.

[PMID: 30832224] <i>Background</i>: Polyphyllin VII (PP7), a steroidal saponin from <i>Paris polyphylla</i>, has been found to exert strong anticancer activity. Little is known about the anti-inflammatory property of PP7. In this study, the anti-inflammatory activity and its underlying mechanisms of PP7 were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and in multiple animal models. <i>Methods</i>: The content of nitric oxide (NO) was determined by spectrophotometry. The levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE₂) and cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes was determined by qPCR. The total and phosphorylated protein levels were examined by Western blotting. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated by using mouse and zebrafish models. <i>Results</i>: PP7 reduced the production of NO and PGE₂ and the protein and mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<i>TNF-α</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, and <i>IL-6</i>) and enzymes (inducible NO synthase [<i>iNOS</i>], cyclooxygenase-2 [<i>COX-2</i>], and Matrix metalloproteinase-9 [<i>MMP-9</i>]) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPKs pathways. Notably, PP7 markedly inhibited xylene-induced ear edema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation in mice and suppressed LPS and CuSO₄-induced inflammation and toxicity in zebrafish embryos. <i>Conclusion</i>: This study demonstrates that PP7 exerts strong anti-inflammatory activities in multiple in vitro and in vivo models and suggests that PP7 is a potential novel therapeutic agent for inflammatory diseases.

[PMID: 29352446] Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) invading and activating microglia causes the most serious subtypes of tuberculosis called tubercular meningitis. However, the developmental process of tubercular meningitis, especially the early phase, is poorly understood due to lacking well-established and well-accepted visible models in vitro and in vivo. Here, consistent with one recent report, we found Mycobacterium marinum (M. marinum) invade the zebrafish brain and subsequently cause granuloma-like structures. We further showed that M. marinum, which shares similar characteristics with M. tuberculosis, can invade microglia and replicate in microglia, which subsequently promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. M. marinum infection in microglia can also promote autophagy, which conversely limits the replication of M. marinum. Thus, pharmacological activation of autophagy by rapamycin could prevent M. marinum replication. Our study provides in vivo and in vitro models to study underlying pathogenic mechanisms of tubercular meningitis by using M. marinum. Our results also showed that activation of autophagy could be a meaningful way to prevent tubercular meningitis.

[PMID: 27806130] Mycobacterium abscessus is considered the most common respiratory pathogen among the rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Infections with M. abscessus are increasingly found in patients with chronic lung diseases, especially cystic fibrosis, and are often refractory to antibiotic therapy. M. abscessus has two morphotypes with distinct effects on host cells and biological responses. The smooth (S) variant is recognized as the initial airway colonizer while the rough (R) is known to be a potent inflammatory inducer associated with invasive disease, but the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of the infection remain unsolved. We conducted a comparative stepwise dissection of the inflammatory response in S and R pathogenesis by monitoring infected transparent zebrafish embryos. Loss of TNFR1 function resulted in increased mortality with both variants, and was associated with unrestricted intramacrophage bacterial growth and decreased bactericidal activity. The use of transgenic zebrafish lines harboring fluorescent macrophages and neutrophils revealed that neutrophils, like macrophages, interact with M. abscessus at the initial infection sites. Impaired TNF signaling disrupted the IL8-dependent neutrophil mobilization, and the defect in neutrophil trafficking led to the formation of aberrant granulomas, extensive mycobacterial cording, unrestricted bacterial growth and subsequent larval death. Our findings emphasize the central role of neutrophils for the establishment and maintenance of the protective M. abscessus granulomas. These results also suggest that the TNF/IL8 inflammatory axis is necessary for protective immunity against M. abscessus and may be of clinical relevance to explain why immunosuppressive TNF therapy leads to the exacerbation of M. abscessus infections.

[PMID: 26449262] Visualization of infection and the associated host response has been challenging in adult vertebrates. Owing to their transparency, zebrafish larvae have been used to directly observe infection in vivo; however, such larvae have not yet developed a functional adaptive immune system. Cells involved in adaptive immunity mature later and have therefore been difficult to access optically in intact animals. Thus, the study of many aspects of vertebrate infection requires dissection of adult organs or ex vivo isolation of immune cells. Recently, CLARITY and PACT (passive clarity technique) methodologies have enabled clearing and direct visualization of dissected organs. Here, we show that these techniques can be applied to image host-pathogen interactions directly in whole animals. CLARITY and PACT-based clearing of whole adult zebrafish and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mouse lungs enables imaging of mycobacterial granulomas deep within tissue to a depth of more than 1 mm. Using established transgenic lines, we were able to image normal and pathogenic structures and their surrounding host context at high resolution. We identified the three-dimensional organization of granuloma-associated angiogenesis, an important feature of mycobacterial infection, and characterized the induction of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) within the granuloma using an established fluorescent reporter line. We observed heterogeneity in TNF induction within granuloma macrophages, consistent with an evolving view of the tuberculous granuloma as a non-uniform, heterogeneous structure. Broad application of this technique will enable new understanding of host-pathogen interactions in situ.

[PMID: 25377142] Granulomas, organized aggregates of immune cells, are a defining feature of tuberculosis (TB). Granuloma formation is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory disorders. However, the tuberculous granuloma has been assigned the role of a host protective structure which ""walls-off"" mycobacteria. Work conducted over the past decade has provided a more nuanced view of its role in pathogenesis. On the one hand, pathogenic mycobacteria accelerate and exploit granuloma formation for their expansion and dissemination by manipulating host immune responses to turn leukocyte recruitment and cell death pathways in their favor. On the other hand, granuloma macrophages can preserve granuloma integrity by exerting a microbicidal immune response, thus preventing an even more rampant expansion of infection in the extracellular milieu. Even this host-beneficial immune response required to maintain the bacteria intracellular must be tempered, as an overly vigorous immune response can also cause granuloma breakdown, thereby directly supporting bacterial growth extracellularly. This review will discuss how mycobacteria manipulate inflammatory responses to drive granuloma formation and will consider the roles of the granuloma in pathogenesis and protective immunity, drawing from clinical studies of TB in humans and from animal models--rodents, zebrafish, and nonhuman primates. A deeper understanding of TB pathogenesis and immunity in the granuloma could suggest therapeutic approaches to abrogate the host-detrimental aspects of granuloma formation to convert it into the host-beneficial structure that it has been thought to be for nearly a century.

[PMID: 24643219] During the past 12 years, we have developed the zebrafish as a model for the study of tuberculosis pathogenesis and immunology. We have taken advantage of the optical transparency and the genetic and pharmacological tractability of the developing zebrafish to monitor infection in real time. Detailed information about the sequential interactions among the host and the pathogen, the cell types, and the molecules involved has yielded surprising insights into this ancient disease. We have identified a number of host evasion strategies deployed by pathogenic mycobacteria as well as host responses that provide broad insights into host immunity. Many of these discoveries have relevance to human tuberculosis and suggest new therapeutic avenues for tuberculosis as well as other inflammatory diseases.

[PMID: 24614659] Francisella spp. are facultative intracellular pathogens identified in increasingly diverse hosts, including mammals. F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis and F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis infect fish inhabiting warm and cold waters, respectively, while F. tularensis subsp. novicida is highly infectious for mice and has been widely used as a model for the human pathogen F. tularensis. Here, we established zebrafish embryo infection models of fluorescently labeled F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis, F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis, and F. tularensis subsp. novicida at 22, 28, and 32°C, respectively. All infections led to significant bacterial growth, as shown by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and to a robust proinflammatory immune response, dominated by increased transcription of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis was the most virulent, F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis caused chronic infection, and F. tularensis subsp. novicida showed moderate virulence and led to formation of relatively small granuloma-like structures. The use of transgenic zebrafish strains with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled immune cells revealed their detailed interactions with Francisella species. All three strains entered preferentially into macrophages, which eventually assembled into granuloma-like structures. Entry into neutrophils was also observed, though the efficiency of this event depended on the route of infection. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the zebrafish embryo model for studying infections caused by different Francisella species at a wide range of temperatures and highlight their interactions with immune cells.

[PMID: 22851747] SecA2 is an ATPase present in some pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, is required for translocation of a limited set of proteins across the cytosolic membrane, and plays an important role in virulence in several bacteria, including mycobacteria that cause diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy. However, the mechanisms by which SecA2 affects virulence are incompletely understood. To investigate whether SecA2 modulates host immune responses in vivo, we studied Mycobacterium marinum infection in two different hosts: an established zebrafish model and a recently described mouse model. Here we show that M. marinum ΔsecA2 was attenuated for virulence in both host species and SecA2 was needed for normal granuloma numbers and for optimal tumor necrosis factor alpha response in both zebrafish and mice. M. marinum ΔsecA2 was more sensitive to SDS and had unique protrusions from its cell envelope when examined by cryo-electron tomography, suggesting that SecA2 is important for bacterial cell wall integrity. These results provide evidence that SecA2 induces granulomas and is required for bacterial modulation of the host response because it affects the mycobacterial cell envelope.",10

Disruption of this axis, through dysbiosis, altered intestinal barrier integrity, microbial translocation, and maladaptive immune activation, has become a central mechanism in the onset and progression of chronic liver diseases. Common pathways include changes in microbial composition and altered production of metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, ethanol, and trimethylamine N-oxide and activation of proinflammatory cascades via Toll-like receptors, NOD receptors, and inflammasomes. These alterations lead to steatosis, oxidative stress, fibrogenesis, and carcinogenesis. Notably, each liver disease presents distinct alterations. Beyond pathogenesis, modulation of the liver-gut axis has been shown to have therapeutic potential. Microbiota-targeted interventions, bile acid signaling modulators, and dietary and lifestyle strategies can restore microbial balance, strengthen the intestinal barrier, and attenuate liver injury. However, long-term safety, disease-specific efficacy, and integration with standard treatments remain key challenges. This review aims to provide an overview of the liver-gut axis. First, it describes its general regulatory mechanisms, then analyzes the specific alterations in the main chronic liver diseases and finally, it discusses the therapeutic implications of acting on this axis.

[PMID: 41179569] Cardiomyopathy (CM) is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by structural and functional changes in the heart, with the exact cause often remaining unknown. CM can arise from both inherited and acquired metabolic disturbances. Alterations in energy production and substrate utilization impair the heart's contractile function and limit its ability to respond to stress. Given the complexity and dynamic nature of CM, as well as the multiple etiologies involved, we reviewed metabolomic studies employing high-throughput platforms to understand how metabolic pathways shift across CM subtypes and how these perturbations may inform clinical translation. Several recurring disruptions emerge across CM with alterations in amino acid metabolism (valine, leucine, methionine, tryptophan, tyrosine); mitochondrial redox imbalance (NAD/NADH shifts, niacinamide, acylcarnitines); and oxidative stress as central hallmarks. Each subtype, however, displays a different emphasis. For instance, hypertrophic CM is characterized by nucleotide remodeling, particularly in cases involving <i>MYBPC3</i> mutations; dilated CM shows accumulation of Krebs cycle intermediates and trimethylamine-N-oxide; restrictive CM is associated with amino acid stress related to amyloidosis; tachycardia-induced CM involves fatty acid remodeling and elevated uric acid, while Takotsubo CM is linked to ketone utilization and glutamate excitotoxicity. Overall, a single metabolomic profile cannot capture CM. What emerges from this review is that subtype-specific shifts, and the way they interact, provide meaningful insight into disease mechanisms and highlight pathways with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic relevance. This broader perspective shifts the focus beyond narrow comparisons, making the translational relevance of metabolomics in CM more apparent.

[PMID: 41178126] Emerging evidence indicates that the gut microbiome (GM) and its metabolites may play a role in the development of cardiometabolic diseases, including atrial fibrillation (AF). Although the current data are limited, studies suggest that the GM composition in AF mirrors that observed in associated conditions such as heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease (characterized by increased genera <i>Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus</i>, and decreased genus <i>Faecalibacterium</i>). Additionally, patients with AF appear to have distinct microbial alterations, including increased abundances of the genera <i>Dialister, Dorea, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Lachnospira, Parabacteroides, Ruminococcus</i>, and <i>Veillonella</i> and decreased abundances of the genera <i>Butyricicoccus, Hungatella</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>. Gut-derived metabolites also show associations with AF. Trimethylamine <i>N</i>-oxide and choline have been linked to new-onset and postoperative AF, potentially via autonomic, inflammatory, and fibrotic pathways. In contrast, short-chain fatty acids, which are reduced in AF patients, may offer protective effects. Elevated lipopolysaccharide levels are correlated with AF onset and recurrence through inflammation and structural remodeling. Indoxyl sulfate and bile acids may contribute to arrhythmogenesis via oxidative stress, apoptosis, and disrupted calcium signaling. These mechanisms contribute to AF by disrupting conduction and increasing automaticity. Emerging evidence also links gut microbes to other arrhythmias, but more research is needed to clarify causality and therapeutic potential.

[PMID: 41175512] In this work, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to simultaneously quantitatively detect the choline (CHL), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), γ-butyrobetaine (GBB), betaine (BET), and ʟ-carnitine (CAR) in human saliva for the first time. Saliva samples collected from healthy volunteers were treated with acetonitrile for protein precipitation, followed by direct injection into the LC-MS/MS system for analysis. The method validation was performed in accordance with the CLSI C62-A standard guidelines. The linearity was in the range of 0.300-300.000 μmol/L for CHL, 0.005-5.000 μmol/L for TMAO, 0.050-50.000 μmol/L for GBB, 0.020-20.000 μmol/L for BET, and 0.100-100.000 μmol/L for CAR. The intra-day and inter-day precision ranged from 1.13 % to 8.34 % and from 1.63 % to 10.65 %, respectively. The recoveries and matrix effects of these analytes ranged from 94.31 % to 108.00 % and from 90.59 % to 111.37 %, respectively. The performance of the method met the requirements of the guidelines. The validated method was subsequently applied to analyze test saliva samples from 43 healthy volunteers and 4 coronary heart disease (CHD) inpatients, to evaluate the distributions of five analytes in healthy people and CHD inpatients. This study provides a reliable and accurate analytical approach for the clinical detection of five analytes in saliva.

[PMID: 41174457] Vegan lunch soups formulated with mushroom, asparagus, leek, and sea buckthorn were previously developed by our team to provide a consistent daily intake of dietary cholinesterase inhibitors. Considering the proposed continuous consumption of these functional soups, it is essential to examine any cytotoxic responses that may occur in the gastro-intestinal tract. This work starts this topic by investigating the effect of in vitro digested soups towards selected human intestinal cells and intestinal bacteria. Reduced viability of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains after 24 h of incubation of each soup with bacteria in the ""large intestine"" was observed, but it was not statistically (P < 0.05) confirmed. Sea buckthorn soup demonstrated the highest cell counts and these observations were confirmed by SEM analysis. All soups (at 1 % and 2.5 % in the medium) showed decreased metabolism of healthy colon epithelial CCD 841 cells (MTT and NR tests). Metabolism of colorectal cancer HT-29 cells was reduced by leek soup (at 0.01 % - 2.5 %) and all other soups at 2.5 % (MTT test), but no effect was observed in MTT test. Asparagus soup decreased the percent number of CCD 841 cells at early apoptosis large stage and all soups increased the percent of CCD 841 cells at the necrosis stage. All soups decreased the percent of HT-29 cells in S phase. Also, mushroom and leek soups increased the percent of HT-29 cells in G2 phase.

[PMID: 41172493] The study evaluated the effect of vegan toothpaste on the surface and elementary constitution of enamel submitted to erosion-abrasion. Human enamel blocks (3x3mm) were submitted to in vitro erosion-abrasion cycling (1% citric acid, 4x/day). After the first and last erosive challenge, the blocks were brushed with the toothpaste: conventional fluoride-free (Bitufo), containing SnF2/SnCl2 (Oral-B Gingiva Detox, 1100 ppm F-), vegan fluoride-free (Boni Natural), or vegan with NaF (Colgate Zero, 1100 ppm F-). The control area was covered with tape, and the test area was left exposed. The tape was removed after cycling, and the blocks were evaluated for surface roughness (Ra, n=10), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, n=5), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, at%, n=5). Data analysis used split ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Dunn tests (α=0.05). Ra values in the test area were higher (p=0.01) for fluoride-free (0.389±0.09) and vegan fluoride-free (0.383±0.08) toothpastes compared to SnF2/SnCl2 (0.297±0.05) and fluoridated vegan (0.303±0.06) toothpastes. EDS analysis showed higher Na% (p=0.02) in enamel exposed to SnF2 and SnCl2 toothpaste (=0.7%) than vegan fluoride-free toothpaste (=0.5%). SEM images indicated less surface alteration in enamel exposed to SnF2/SnCl2 toothpaste. Vegan toothpaste with fluoride showed better performance in reducing the effects of surface alteration than vegan fluoride-free toothpaste; however, toothpaste containing SnF2/SnCl2 promoted the enamel surface to be less altered.

[PMID: 41171588] Hair thinning is a prevalent concern influenced by multiple factors including stress, hormonal changes, diet, and lifestyle, with varying impacts across demographic groups. Oral supplements addressing these key root causes through a multi-targeting, patented, botanical-based Synergen Complex have been developed to combat hair thinning across different populations. This study sought to build on existing evidence from previous clinical studies evaluating hair growth and quality by evaluating the effectiveness of these nutraceuticals in enhancing hair fiber diameter, and thus hair strength and length, in adults with thinning hair. This 6-month, prospective, open-label study included women, plant-based women, menopausal women, parous women, and men consuming commercially available hair growth nutraceuticals (HGNs) targeted to different demographics (Nutrafol<sup>®</sup> Women, Vegan, Balance, Postpartum, and Men). All subjects had hair thinning, self-reported and confirmed by the study dermatologist. Assessments occurred at baseline, day 90, and day 180. Measurements included hair shaft diameter via light microscopy, hair breakage/shedding via a four-region hair pull test, investigator global assessment (IGA) of hair parameters, and subject self-perception questionnaire. A total of 252 participants enrolled, with 244 completing the study per protocol. Ingestion of the HGNs was associated with a significant increase in hair shaft diameter across all groups by day 180. Hair pull tests showed significant reductions in intact, broken, and total hair shedding overall. In-person IGA was correlated with significant improvements in hair attributes-strength, length, thickness, and overall hair health-across all groups. Self-perception data revealed strong agreement across groups with statements regarding hair improvements by day 180. This study demonstrates that ingestion of these bio-specific HGNs are associated with significantly enhanced hair shaft diameter and decreased breakage, resulting in longer, stronger hair across their intended populations. These findings support the use of these HGNs for hair thinning, offering alternative options for various populations for improving hair growth and thickness. gov identifier, NCT06362941.

[PMID: 41168846] Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) are a key component of the microbial food webs, playing an essential role in nutrient recycling and energy transfer in aquatic ecosystems. They have been typically considered to be bacterivores, but they can also be omnivorous (feeding on prokaryotes and other eukaryotes) and predatory grazers (feeding on other eukaryotes). Here, we combine CARD-FISH with both short and long-amplicon sequencing to resolve the dynamics of key HNF groups during two high-frequency sampling campaigns in spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) phytoplankton blooms in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. This approach allowed us to resolve the microbial food web dynamics within HNF communities at the phylotype level at time scales relevant to HNF duplication times. Omnivorous katablepharids and predatory MAST-2 dominated the HNF community, especially in spring. Bacterivorous groups (e.g., MAST-1, CRY1) were less abundant. Long-read sequencing revealed distinct seasonal shifts in dominant phylotypes, with Katablepharis sp. and MAST-2D peaking in spring, while other lineages became more prominent in summer and autumn. The high abundance of omnivorous HNF, compared to bacterivores, highlights their key role both as grazers of bacteria and flagellates, and as a food source for predatory and omnivorous ciliates.

[PMID: 41165739] Neurological disorders (NDs) represent a significant global health challenges, with neurodegeneration being a common pathological feature. Recent investigations indicate the involvement of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in these disorders, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive decline. The gut-brain axis, a communication network between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS), is influenced by microbial metabolites, which can cross the blood-brain barrier and impact brain function. Key metabolites such as trimethylamine <i>N</i>-oxide (TMAO), para-cresol sulfate (pCS), 4-ethylphenyl sulfate (4-EPS), and indoxyl sulfate (IS) have been linked with the progression of neurological disorders. TMAO disrupts blood-brain barrier integrity, promotes oxidative stress, and activates microglial cells, which lead to the apoptosis of neurons, resulting in neuroinflammation. This could also result in psychiatric changes and behavioral disorders. pCS produced from gut bacteria metabolizing dietary proteins is correlated with amplified oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments in disorders like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, elevated 4-EPS levels are linked to autism spectrum disorder, contributing to anxiety-like behavior and blood-brain barrier disruption. Understanding the mechanisms by which gut-derived metabolites affect neurological health could lead to novel therapeutic strategies that can target gut microbiota for the medication and treatment of neurological disorders. Dietary precursors and gut microbiota metabolites, modulated by probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics, play a critical role in maintaining microbiota homeostasis and influencing neurological health, needing sophisticated biosensors to enable real-time monitoring and early intervention in disorders linked to gut metabolite imbalances.

[PMID: 41164885] Gut-microbiota dysbiosis has been linked to cognitive decline. Given its role in metabolism, immunity, and environmental interactions, broader molecular signaling alterations are likely. We analyzed gut microbiota composition, plasma and fecal metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines across cognitive stages, from healthy controls to dementia. Alpha diversity declined with increasing cognitive impairment severity. Short-chain fatty acid-producing Firmicutes and Bacteroidota decreased from 76% and 17% in controls to 59% and 11% in dementia, respectively. Proteobacteria (e.g., Escherichia-Shigella) rose from < 2% to 4%, and Verrucomicrobiota from 3% to 11%. Despite overall Firmicutes decline, Ruminococcus gnavus, a mucus-degrading species, increased in dementia. These shifts correlated with elevated plasma cytokines, suggesting a link between gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation. Bacteria-associated metabolites, including bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, oxylipins, sugars, and fatty acids were significantly altered. Changes were seen as early as subjective cognitive decline. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and explore microbiome-based interventions. Examined gut microbiota, inflammation, and metabolic changes in cognitive impairment stages Early metabolic changes in feces detected before plasma alterations Observed shifts in gut microbiota and inflammation associated with cognitive decline Suggests potential for early biomarkers based on gut metabolites Calls for larger, longitudinal studies to validate findings.",10

However, the extent to which these problems exist in RCTs of cerebrovascular disease is not well understood. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of discontinuation and nonpublication among cerebrovascular clinical trials and explore characteristics associated with each. We searched Clinicaltrials.gov using selected keywords to identify relevant RCTs. Trials generated in our search were screened to exclude unrelated trials, active trials, and trials completed within the previous three years. We analyzed included RCTs to identify the publication status or reason for discontinuation. Of the 421 included RCTs, 245 (58.2%) were completed and 176 (41.8%) were discontinued. Trials investigating medical devices and government-funded trials had the lowest rates of discontinuation. Participant accrual difficulty was the most common reason for discontinuation identified (12.5%), though 52.8% of the discontinued trials did not provide a reason for discontinuation. There were 226 published trials (53.7%) and 195 unpublished trials (46.3%). Unpublished trials included 135 of the 176 discontinued trials (76.7%) and 60 of 245 completed trials (24.5%). Trial discontinuation was significantly associated with nonpublication. Trials funded by the National Institutes of Health were less likely to be unpublished. Premature discontinuation was common among cerebrovascular trials in neurosurgery and frequently attributed to difficulties with patient enrollment. Nonpublication was especially common among discontinued trials. Our findings may highlight opportunities to improve research efficiency and potentially improve outcomes for patients with cerebrovascular diseases.

[PMID: 39843332] Data on the early use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients with acute heart failure (HF) are conflicting, and mostly evaluating soft endpoints (i.e., indices of congestion, renal function, ejection fraction, and diuresis). The aim was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess their impact after an HF decompensation event. Two electronic databases were screened for eligible studies. Efficacy endpoints were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, length of hospital stay, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (nt-proBNP). Safety endpoints included acute kidney injury (AKI), volume depletion, ketoacidosis, hypotension, hypoglycemia, non-cardiovascular death, urinary tract infection, genital infections, serious adverse events (AE), and AE leading to treatment discontinuation. Two pre-specified subgroup analyses were planned according to the specific SGLT2i and clinical setting [i.e., acute myocardial infarction (MI) versus non-acute MI]. 16 RCTs enrolling 15,073 patients were considered. Early initiation of SGLT2i significantly reduced the risk of HF hospitalizations [Risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95 % Confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.87], AKI (RR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.59-0.99), and nt-proBNP levels (MD -354 pg/mL). No significant difference was detected for any of the other endpoints. In the pre-specified subgroup analysis, a significant interaction was found between the SGLT2i type and the risk of AKI, in favor of empagliflozin. In patients recently hospitalized for acute HF, early administration of SGLT2i was associated with fewer readmissions for HF and AKI, as well as decongestant effects, without raising any safety concern.

[PMID: 37311508] Discontinued and unpublished randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are common resulting in biased publication and loss of potential knowledge. The magnitude of selective publication within vascular surgery remains unknown. RCT relevant to vascular surgery registered (01/01/2010-10/31/2019) on ClinicalTrials.gov were included. Trials ending normally with conclusion of participant treatment and examination were considered completed whereas discontinued trials stopped early. Publications were identified through automatically indexed PubMed citations on ClinicalTrials.gov or manually identified on PubMed or Google Scholar >30 months after the completion date, the date the final participant was examined, allowing time for publication. Of 108 RCT (n = 37, 837), 22.2% (24/108) were discontinued, including 16.7% (4/24) stopped prior to and 83.3% (20/24) after starting enrollment. Only 28.4% of estimated enrollment was achieved for all discontinued RCT. Nineteen (79.2%) investigators provided a reason for discontinuation, which most commonly included poor enrollment (45.8%), inadequate supplies or funding (12.5%), and trial design concerns (8.3%). Of the 20 trials terminated following enrollment, 20.0% (4/20) were published in peer-reviewed journals and 80.0% (16/20) failed to reach publication. Of the 77.8% trials completed, 75.0% (63/84) were published and 25.0% (21/84) remain unpublished. In a multivariate regression of completed trials, industry funding was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of peer-reviewed publication (OR = 0.18, (95% CI 0.05-0.71), P = 0.01). Of the discontinued and completed trials remaining unpublished, 62.5% and 61.9% failed to report results on ClinicalTrials.gov, respectively, encompassing a total of 4,788 enrollees without publicly available results. Nearly 25% of registered vascular RCT were discontinued. Of completed RCT, 25% remain unpublished with industry funding associated with decreased likelihood of publication. This study identifies opportunities to report all findings for completed and discontinued vascular surgery RCT, whether industry sponsored, or investigator initiated.

[PMID: 27885950] OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the trial discontinuation and publication rate of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in neurosurgery. METHODS Trials registered from 2000 to 2012 were identified on the website clinicaltrials.gov using a range of key words related to neurosurgery. Any trials that were actively recruiting or had unknown status were excluded. Included trials were assessed for whether they were discontinued early on the clinicaltrials.gov database; this included trials identified as withdrawn, suspended, or terminated in the database. For included trials, a range of parameters was identified including the subspecialty, primary country, study start date, type of intervention, number of centers, and funding status. Subsequently, a systematic search for published peer-reviewed articles was undertaken. For trials that were discontinued early or were found to be unpublished, principal investigators were sent a querying email. RESULTS Sixty-four neurosurgical trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Of these 64, 26.6% were discontinued early, with slow or insufficient recruitment cited as the major reason (57%). Of the 47 completed trials, 14 (30%) remained unpublished. Discontinued trials showed a statistically significant higher chance of remaining unpublished (88%) compared with completed trials (p = 0.0002). Industry-funded trials had a higher discontinuation rate (31%) compared with non-industry-funded trials (23%), but this result did not reach significance (p = 0.57). Reporting of primary outcome measures was complete in 20 (61%) of 33 trials. For secondary outcome measures, complete reporting occurred in only 11 (33.3%) of 33. CONCLUSIONS More than a fifth (26.6%) of neurosurgical RCTs are discontinued early and almost a third of those that are completed remain unpublished. This result highlights significant waste of financial resources and clinical data.

[PMID: 41187375] To compare cost-effectiveness of targeted therapeutic strategies for non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHB) patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage endometrial cancer. A Markov-based cost-utility model using a third-party payer perspective compared concurrent and maintenance treatment strategies incorporating dostarlimab and trastuzumab for newly diagnosed stage III-IV endometrial cancer: chemotherapy alone; 3 universal immunotherapy strategies (universal concurrent and maintenance dostarlimab +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu-positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas); and 3 targeted immunotherapy strategies (dostarlimab for mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors +/- trastuzumab for HER2/neu positive serous and/or carcinosarcomas). Costs (2024 USD), utilities, and clinical estimates were derived from published literature and the National Cancer Database. The base case analysis was a microsimulation with 10,000 runs, accompanied by a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 20,000 trials. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We performed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses on key parameters and analyses stratified by race/ethnicity. All targeted immunotherapy strategies were cost-effective compared to chemotherapy alone in both NHB and NHW, while universal immunotherapy was never cost-effective. Targeted strategies were more cost-effective in NHB than NHW. Targeted dostarlimab for dMMR plus trastuzumab for HER2 serous and carcinosarcomas was the most cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy, with an ICER of $119,945/QALY. In sensitivity analysis, assuming longer durations of treatment benefit resulted in lower ICERs. Personalized treatment strategies incorporating HER2 and MMR testing should be considered to optimize both cost-effectiveness and equity in care.

[PMID: 41187327] Neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized as pain arising from lesions of the somatosensory nervous system. However, NP-like features have been found in several chronic secondary musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions in the absence of detectable lesion or damage to the somatosensory pathways. Emerging evidence has demonstrated associations between NP-like symptoms and altered neural activity within brain regions implicated in sensory perception and affective-emotional processing of pain with consistent findings of abnormal activity in the right insula (RIns) cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG-NF) is a brain-computer interface biofeedback technique that allows individuals to self-regulate the real-time cortical brain activities of the regions of interest. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of a novel EEG-NF intervention designed to simultaneously downtrain activity in the RIns and dACC in individuals with a chronic secondary MSK pain condition exhibiting NP-like features. In addition, this study will conduct secondary exploratory analyses to investigate EEG-derived neuronal changes and their associations with clinical and experimental pain outcomes following the EEG-NF training. We will design a single-arm, open-label, pilot-feasibility trial. We will recruit adults aged 35-75 years with a score of ≥19 using the PainDETECT questionnaire and an average pain score of ≥4 on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the last 3 months, with a minimum pain duration of 3 months, to receive active EEG-NF training. Participants will receive auditory feedback as a reward for achieving a predetermined activity threshold of the RIns and dACC. Primary outcomes will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and safety using both self-reported questionnaires and monitoring data. Collected data will be summarized descriptively, with mean (SD) reported where appropriate. Secondary outcomes will include EEG parameters, self-reported measures, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing. An exploratory within-group pre-post statistical comparison will be conducted for all secondary outcome measures, and correlation analysis will be performed to explore relationships between EEG measures, self-reported outcomes, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing measures. This study has received approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Participant recruitment began in April 2025 and is ongoing. As of October 2025, data collection has been completed, with a total of 5 participants enrolled, all of whom have completed the study to date. We expect to complete the study in March 2026. This study will generate data on feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary data to inform a fully powered effectiveness clinical trial. The results and data generated will inform the design and sample size calculation for a fully powered randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of EEG-NF in targeting NP-like features in individuals with chronic MSK pain.

[PMID: 41187260] The venipuncture is one of the most frequently performed procedures in health care. Arm phantoms are available for training, because the procedure itself can be challenging. These phantom arms do not represent a realistic setting and do not offer opportunities to train challenging scenarios. This randomized, single-blind study aimed to train health care workers on both a commercially available injection arm and an in-house developed 3D-printed arm, to evaluate the perceived realism and adequacy of training on both arms. Participants were trained on both the commercially available arm (arm A) and the 3D-printed arm (arm B). Participants were randomized and blinded from knowing which arm they started training on. A questionnaire was filled in on, among others, the perceived realism of the arm (0 for not realistic, 100 for realistic) and adequacy of the training (inadequate, moderate, or adequate). A total of 68 participants evaluated the perceived realism of arm A and B, which were scored on average 62.97 (SD 21.47) and 63.79 (SD 17.45), respectively. The difference in perceived realism of the two arms was not statistically significant (based on the paired t test, mean difference=-0.82, P=.78). Training on arm A was reported inadequate by 7% (5/68 participants), moderately adequate by 31% (21/68), and adequate by 62% (42/68). This was not significantly different from arm B (marginal homogeneity test, P=.74), with 4% (3/68), 38% (26/68), and 57% (39/68), respectively, reporting that the training was inadequate, moderately adequate, and adequate. The 3D-printed arm is as realistic and provides an equally adequate training compared to the commercially available arm. The 3D-printed arm offers the additional possibility to design different models representing several levels of difficulty for vascular morphology. This potentially lowers the number of venipuncture failures by preparing health care workers on challenging scenarios.

[PMID: 41187196] The safety of single-port totally extraperitoneal (STEP) inguinal hernia repair compared to conventional totally extraperitoneal (CTEP) has been supported by various randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, the optimal method remains unclear because of variations in the location and length of the incision as well as different uses of the single-port device. We standardized STEP using the glove method with a straight umbilical incision that maintained the wound profile within the confines of the umbilicus for better cosmetic satisfaction and port operative pain reduction. The incision length was limited to 1-1.5 cm, extending no further than the umbilicus. The STEP is performed utilizing the glove method using Alexis of XXS size. To minimize forceps interference, the surgeon dissected the spermatic cord into two distinct phases. As the mesh was inserted within the pneumoperitoneum, it was deployed safely and securely. In addition, we present the surgical outcomes at our institution for an early career surgeon. A total of 25 unilateral inguinal hernia STEP procedures were performed between April and October 2023. The median operative time was 68 minutes, and the procedure was performed safely with no complications requiring treatment. In conclusion, STEP using the glove method with a total intraumbilical incision can be safely performed by an early career surgeon.

[PMID: 41187145] Venepuncture-associated pain is a major source of distress commonly experienced by adult patients in day-to-day clinical practice. Topical lignocaine application before venepuncture may address this issue, but this delivery approach may be suboptimal. Hence, we aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of a novel lignocaine-embedded transdermal microneedle array patch (LEMAP) in facilitating transcutaneous lignocaine delivery to reduce procedural-related pain in adults undergoing venepuncture in a tertiary-care outpatient clinic setting. This is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, active-controlled, double-blind, randomised superiority trial divided into two distinct stages. Twenty (single-group LEMAP recipients) and 144 adult patients (72 per group; randomised to either LEMAP (intervention) or 5% EMLA patch (control) applied on antecubital fossa, near the venepuncture site, for 30 minutes) aged 18 years and above requiring routine venepuncture will be recruited from the Ophthalmology Outpatient Clinic, Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz, for stage I and II of this trial, respectively. For the stage I trial, the safety endpoints are lignocaine's pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical adverse events. In the stage II trial, the primary endpoints are the venepuncture-associated pain experience, which will be evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the skin conductance algesimeter index (SCAI) scores at one-minute post-venepuncture. Non-linear mixed-effect model and multiple linear regression will be used to analyse the stage I and II trial outcomes, respectively. The trial protocol has been registered with the clinicaltrial.gov registry (ID: NCT05694858) and adheres to the SPIRIT 2025 reporting guideline. All trial participants will provide written informed consent, which the trial investigators will obtain before trial enrollment and randomisation. The trial findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences and shared with participants via the web-based trial notification system..

[PMID: 41187137] Sleep disturbances are common among older adults, affecting up to 50% of this population and significantly impacting quality of life and health outcomes. Music therapy has been proposed as a non-pharmacological intervention to improve sleep quality in this population, but evidence regarding its effectiveness remains inconsistent across individual studies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize available evidence on the effectiveness of music therapy interventions for improving sleep quality in elderly adults.. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. Major databases were searched for studies evaluating music interventions for sleep quality in adults aged 50 + years. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for RCTs and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for non-RCTs. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using both common effect and random effects models. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The initial search retrieved 473 articles from electronic databases. After removing duplicates and screening, 10 studies (6 RCTs, 4 non-RCTs) published between 2010 and 2023 with 602 participants met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The random effects model showed significant improvement in sleep quality with music therapy (SMD: -0.79; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.33; P < .001). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I² = 79%; Q = 42.54; P < .001). Subgroup analysis revealed significant benefits in RCTs (SMD: -0.59; 95% CI, -1.11 to -0.07) but not in non-RCTs (SMD: -1.08; 95% CI, -2.36 to 0.19). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of findings, and no publication bias was detected. GRADE assessment indicated very low certainty of evidence for both RCTs and non-RCTs due to risk of bias concerns and substantial heterogeneity. Music therapy demonstrates significant improvement in sleep quality among older adults; however, the very low certainty of evidence based on GRADE assessment suggests caution in clinical recommendations. Future research should address methodological limitations, particularly regarding bias in outcome measurement and intervention implementation, to provide more definitive evidence for clinical practice guidelines.",10

Specifically, we examined the mechanisms underlying interleukin (IL)-6 production by osteoblasts stimulated with live and lyophilized F. alocis, and F. alocis-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were stimulated with live bacteria of F. alocis and, as a comparative control, P. gingivalis. Furthermore, cells were treated with F. alocis lyophilized whole cells or EVs, and IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA; cytokine expression profiled using membrane-based array; and mRNA expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using specific inhibitors. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests with significance set at p < 0.05. F. alocis live bacteria, lyophilized whole cells, and F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and chemokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, IL-6 production by F. alocis involved osteoblast activation via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on the bacterial surface or released EVs. Lyophilized F. alocis induced IκB-ζ mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Moreover, F. alocis-derived EVs induced IL-6 production in osteoblasts via protein kinase C (PKC). Live and lyophilized F. alocis and F. alocis-derived EVs induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts, including IL-6. Additionally, the induction of IL-6 by F. alocis-derived EVs involves the activation of TLR2 and PKC. Conclusively, these findings suggest that F. alocis-induced cytokine production by osteoblasts may induce osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

[PMID: 41187361] To explore the mechanism of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa on the accumulation of γ-glutamyl peptides and taste development in Jinhua ham, the influences of R. mucilaginosa on fungal community structure, functional enzyme gene expression, key enzyme activities, γ-glutamyl peptides accumulation and taste attributes were investigated during the dry-ripening. In comparison with Pichia kudriavzevii XS-5 (PK), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa XZY63-3 (RX) and no inoculation (CK), the inoculation with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa EIODSF019 (RE) showed the highest overall acceptance and richness. Metagenomics revealed that RE inoculation inhibited Aspergillus abundance, and the profile of Rhodotorula reached 45.94 % at genus level. The treatment of RE increased the gene abundance of amino acid metabolism pathways; the expression levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase gene in RE were increased by 83.27 % compared with CK, and the activities of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase increased from 214 U/g proteins of CK to 567 U/g proteins of RE. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the total contents of γ-glutamyl peptides increased from 136.40 μg/g of CK to 518.18 μg/g of RE. Partial least squares regression and correlation analysis indicated that γ-Glu-Cys and γ-Glu-Gln were mainly responsible for the improvement of overall acceptance and richness of Jinhua ham with RE inoculation.

[PMID: 41187353] The appearance time of blood components in the brain provides complementary information about cerebral microvascular dynamics. Plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) behave differently in the microcirculation: while plasma can pass through peripheral layers of capillaries, RBCs carry oxygen and are affected by phenomena such as the Fåhræus-Lindqvist effect and plasma skimming. Our study aims at visualizing these differences in vivo using H<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O PET to assess plasma appearance time (ATPlasma) and<sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub>PET to assess RBC appearance time (ATRBC), and demonstrated that the relative delay of RBCs compared with plasma correlates with the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). &#xD;Methods We retrospectively analyzed PET images obtained with<sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub>and H<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O administration in 40 patients, comprising a total of 63 scan data. Appearance time images were generated by fitting tissue curves both for the<sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub>(AT<sub>RBC</sub>) andH<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O phases (AT<sub>Plasma</sub>). AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>values were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs) and compared. Additionally, differences between AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>(ΔAT) were analyzed in relation to OEF. &#xD;Results: AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>images exhibited similar spatial distributions. A strong correlation was observed between them as AT<sub>RBC</sub>= 0.80·AT<sub>Plasma</sub>+ 1.8,<i>r</i>= 0.86), suggesting that RBCs flow faster than plasma. The difference between the two (ΔAT) showed a moderate correlation with OEF (<i>r</i>= 0.44), indicating that higher OEF values are associated with slower RBC movement relative to plasma. This finding suggests that under certain ischemic conditions, RBC flow is more severely impaired than plasma flow. &#xD;Conclusion: This study demonstrates that AT<sub>RBC</sub>and AT<sub>Plasma</sub>are closely related measures of cerebral blood appearance time. The observed association between their difference and OEF suggests a potential link to ischemic pathology.

[PMID: 41187279] Since January 2022, Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates has implemented the 4-day work week model for the first time in the public and private sectors, including universities. While this framework may enhance productivity and work-life balance for many professionals, the current study specifically explores the perceptions of students in medicine, dentistry, and health sciences programs regarding the impact of transitioning from a 5-day to a 4-day work week on their academic performance. The objective of this study was to explore and analyze the perceptions of students in medicine, dentistry, and health sciences regarding the implementation of a 4-day academic week in the Emirate of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Twenty-four university students (mean age 20.95, SD 1.30 years; 12 men) studying in medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, nursing, or medical diagnostic imaging programs, who experienced a transition from a 5-day week to a 4-day week, participated in semistructured interviews lasting approximately 20-30 minutes. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The Braun and Clarke 6-phase framework of thematic analysis was used. We identified 5 themes: academic journey, academic work-life balance, support systems, classroom dynamics, and common stressors of the 4-day academic week. Overall, most students reported increased motivation, engagement, and academic achievement following the transition from a 5-day to a 4-day week. In addition, participants described a positive academic work-life balance, improved physical and mental well-being, optimal use of time for both academic and personal commitments, favorable support from faculty and family members, and maintained or even improved attendance levels. Nevertheless, some students expressed concerns about condensed schedules and longer days, increased stress, disrupted work-life balance, and inadequate support systems to cope with this new framework. Overall, the 4-day academic week enhanced motivation, academic performance, work-life balance, and the physical and mental well-being of medicine, dental, and health science students. However, some students experienced challenges related to condensed schedules and increased stress. These mixed outcomes highlight that while the 4-day work week offers notable advantages, careful planning and support are essential to mitigate the potential drawbacks and ensure all students can succeed within this new academic framework. Future research could explore strategies to address these challenges and further improve the 4-day week experience for all students.

[PMID: 41187277] As the number of individuals diagnosed with dementia continues to grow, collective caregiving capacity is simultaneously declining. As a result, caregivers often face significant stress and burnout, which negatively impacts both their well-being and the quality of care they are able to provide. To address these challenges, various forms of technology have been developed to support caregiving responsibilities for people with dementia. Barriers to widespread adoption include the cost of technology, lack of caregiver training, limited awareness of available solutions, privacy and ethical concerns, and resistance to change from both caregivers and care recipients. By identifying these key insights, this study seeks to inform the development of more accessible, user-friendly, and effective technological solutions that can better support caregivers in their vital roles. This study aimed to assess the way dementia caregivers solve common challenges, focusing on technology adoption and barriers to its use. We conducted online surveys regarding technology usage and caregiving experience, which were distributed to the communities of caregivers of people living with dementia. Surveys quantified categories of technology use and caregiver needs. The survey also gathered open responses for joys, struggles, and technology use. Follow-up interviews with caregivers discussed how specific challenges were met. The responses were thematically coded to characterize findings by the type-struggles, social supports, technology, and joy. Respondents (N=69) identified access to resources as the most important unmet need for caregivers (53%). The survey found that medication and routine tracking applications and mobility assistive devices were the most commonly used forms of technology. The dominant need expressed by caregivers was for better access to resources, with improved access to health care services and financial support. Interviewees reported barriers to accessing resources, including high costs and difficulties in selecting appropriate technology resources. Additionally, centralizing resources and simplifying the process of locating support was recommended as a solution. The study showed that caregivers felt inadequately supported and did not frequently use technology due to barriers of access and usability of products. Strategies in product design and user communication that engage dementia care partners would likely accelerate adoption.

[PMID: 41187269] Population aging underlines the critical need to improve health professional training to adequately care for adults aged >60 years. Developing educational resources to support academics and professionals presents a valuable opportunity to enhance understanding of health conditions and improve clinical management. Serious games are designed to develop teaching, training, and learning skills. Their use in the educational setting is warranted, as they integrate digital aspects and gamification to create a playful experience for content acquisition. Deepening this theme in nursing education will improve assistance to the older adult population, leading to more qualified care based on gerontological practices and comprehensive health care for older adults. This study aims to develop and validate a serious game on older adult health for undergraduate nursing students. This quantitative and descriptive methodological study, conducted between February 2023 and December 2023 at a public university in the Federal District of Brazil, involved the active participation of 27 undergraduate nursing students in their eighth to tenth semesters. The game, Health Unit in Focus (HUF), was developed and validated with their input. It features 75 clinical cases distributed across 3 themes: pharmacology, metabolic syndrome, and semiology. Of the 40 students initially enrolled, 27 completed the study. The app was validated using the System Usability Scale and student feedback, and the results were reported following the Game-Based Intervention Reporting Guidelines (GAMING). The participants had a mean age of 22.67 (SD 1.44) years, were mostly female (20/27, 74%), and were in their eighth semester (26/27, 96%). The game received an average System Usability Scale score of 85.75 (median 86.57), classified as excellent, as all evaluated items scored >75. Participants considered the game easy to use; accessible; practical; and rich in well-founded, useful content. This high usability score, coupled with the overwhelmingly positive feedback from the students, instills confidence in the game's effectiveness. Furthermore, 100% (27/27) of students agreed that learning through games is effective and expressed interest in incorporating more interactive games into their training. The serious game HUF showed good usability, as its overall score was ""excellent,"" with its highest score in the odd-numbered items that addressed the positive aspects identified in the analysis. The serious game HUF is not just a valid and reliable tool for training nursing students but also an engaging and interactive approach to learning. Its ability to captivate and involve students in the learning process is a testament to its potential to revolutionize nursing education. It is essential that the development of new methodological resources, such as serious games, be based on scientific evidence to guarantee greater reliability and success in achieving their established objectives.

[PMID: 41187268] Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac aging and its susceptibility to injury are not fully understood. Although literature reports a role for mitochondrial Arginase 2 (ARG2) in heart failure, contradictory results are reported. How ARG2 participates in cardiac aging is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>Arg2</i> is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and humans but is upregulated in non-myocyte cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of <i>Arg2</i> (<i>Arg2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that ARG2 mediates IL-1β release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, ARG2 enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1β from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of ARG2 through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

[PMID: 41187267] The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Specifically, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic data sets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yields 1,865 high-confidence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular fingerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding affinity profiles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

[PMID: 41187266] In the zebrafish retina, incident light undergoes wavelength-dependent processing encompassing mechanisms such as color opponency, contrast enhancement, and motion detection prior to neural transmission to the brain proper. In darkness, photoreceptors continuously release glutamate into the synaptic cleft, a process that diminishes in response to increased light intensity, thereby conveying visual signals to ON and OFF bipolar cells. Specifically, in zebrafish, the ON pathway signal transduction is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 6b (mGluR6b) and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs). Here, we demonstrate that the knockout of <i>eaat5b</i> and <i>eaat7</i> disrupts electroretinogram responses to short and long-wavelength stimuli while preserving middle-wavelength responses, suggesting wavelength-specific roles. We found differential expression of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in the outer plexiform layer, particularly in the strike zone, crucial for prey capture, supporting task-specific involvement of these signaling pathways. In order to investigate this, we developed a virtual hunting assay using UV light stimuli. Such a behavioral assay targeting short and long wavelengths indicates that EAAT5b and EAAT7 influence UV-dependent prey detection and motion sensing differently. Our findings highlight the importance of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in modulating light integration dynamics in the zebrafish retina.

[PMID: 41187251] Paralytic ileus is a frequent complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), contributing to increased morbidity, nutritional compromise, and risk of infection. Despite its clinical relevance, data on its incidence, predictors, management, and outcomes in AP remain limited. We conducted a retrospective study of 426 adult patients admitted with AP over a 3-year period at a tertiary-care center. The primary outcome was paralytic ileus; secondary outcomes included infected necrosis, intervention, and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors expressed as adjusted odds ratio (aOR). Paralytic ileus occurred in 167/426 (39.2%) patients. Patients with ileus were more frequently male, obese, and had higher rates of SIRS compared to those without ileus. They also exhibited significantly higher leukocyte counts, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), serum creatinine, and lower serum albumin and sodium levels. In multivariate analysis, obesity (aOR: 2.329), NLR (aOR: 1.131), serum albumin (aOR: 0.342), and serum sodium (aOR: 0.802) were identified as independent predictors. An NLR of 9.5 had a sensitivity of 82.6% and a specificity of 76.1% for predicting paralytic ileus. Conservative management resolved ileus in 85% of cases, 6% responded to neostigmine, while 9% with unresolved ileus succumbed to multiorgan failure. Paralytic ileus was independently associated with increased risk of infected necrosis (aOR: 3.62), intervention (aOR: 4.43), and mortality (aOR: 4.71). Paralytic ileus affects a significant proportion of patients with moderate to severe AP and is a marker of local and systemic complications. Paralytic ileus was an independent predictor of infected necrosis, intervention, and mortality, underscoring its prognostic relevance.",10

While this framework may enhance productivity and work-life balance for many professionals, the current study specifically explores the perceptions of students in medicine, dentistry, and health sciences programs regarding the impact of transitioning from a 5-day to a 4-day work week on their academic performance. The objective of this study was to explore and analyze the perceptions of students in medicine, dentistry, and health sciences regarding the implementation of a 4-day academic week in the Emirate of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Twenty-four university students (mean age 20.95, SD 1.30 years; 12 men) studying in medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, nursing, or medical diagnostic imaging programs, who experienced a transition from a 5-day week to a 4-day week, participated in semistructured interviews lasting approximately 20-30 minutes. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The Braun and Clarke 6-phase framework of thematic analysis was used. We identified 5 themes: academic journey, academic work-life balance, support systems, classroom dynamics, and common stressors of the 4-day academic week. Overall, most students reported increased motivation, engagement, and academic achievement following the transition from a 5-day to a 4-day week. In addition, participants described a positive academic work-life balance, improved physical and mental well-being, optimal use of time for both academic and personal commitments, favorable support from faculty and family members, and maintained or even improved attendance levels. Nevertheless, some students expressed concerns about condensed schedules and longer days, increased stress, disrupted work-life balance, and inadequate support systems to cope with this new framework. Overall, the 4-day academic week enhanced motivation, academic performance, work-life balance, and the physical and mental well-being of medicine, dental, and health science students. However, some students experienced challenges related to condensed schedules and increased stress. These mixed outcomes highlight that while the 4-day work week offers notable advantages, careful planning and support are essential to mitigate the potential drawbacks and ensure all students can succeed within this new academic framework. Future research could explore strategies to address these challenges and further improve the 4-day week experience for all students.

[PMID: 41187277] As the number of individuals diagnosed with dementia continues to grow, collective caregiving capacity is simultaneously declining. As a result, caregivers often face significant stress and burnout, which negatively impacts both their well-being and the quality of care they are able to provide. To address these challenges, various forms of technology have been developed to support caregiving responsibilities for people with dementia. Barriers to widespread adoption include the cost of technology, lack of caregiver training, limited awareness of available solutions, privacy and ethical concerns, and resistance to change from both caregivers and care recipients. By identifying these key insights, this study seeks to inform the development of more accessible, user-friendly, and effective technological solutions that can better support caregivers in their vital roles. This study aimed to assess the way dementia caregivers solve common challenges, focusing on technology adoption and barriers to its use. We conducted online surveys regarding technology usage and caregiving experience, which were distributed to the communities of caregivers of people living with dementia. Surveys quantified categories of technology use and caregiver needs. The survey also gathered open responses for joys, struggles, and technology use. Follow-up interviews with caregivers discussed how specific challenges were met. The responses were thematically coded to characterize findings by the type-struggles, social supports, technology, and joy. Respondents (N=69) identified access to resources as the most important unmet need for caregivers (53%). The survey found that medication and routine tracking applications and mobility assistive devices were the most commonly used forms of technology. The dominant need expressed by caregivers was for better access to resources, with improved access to health care services and financial support. Interviewees reported barriers to accessing resources, including high costs and difficulties in selecting appropriate technology resources. Additionally, centralizing resources and simplifying the process of locating support was recommended as a solution. The study showed that caregivers felt inadequately supported and did not frequently use technology due to barriers of access and usability of products. Strategies in product design and user communication that engage dementia care partners would likely accelerate adoption.

[PMID: 41187148] Immune dysregulation is a pathogenic factor in ulcerative colitis (UC), in which mitochondrial involvement is increasingly recognized. This study aimed to construct a diagnostic model using mitochondria-related genes, identify new target genes, and illuminate the roles of mitochondria-related genes in energy metabolism, immune infiltration and the pathogenesis of UC. RNA expression data from 465 patients with UC and 154 healthy controls (HCs) were obtained from the GEO database. A total of 128 mitochondria-related differentially expressed genes (Mito-DEGs) were identified between patients with UC and HCs. A diagnostic model constructed from 20 genes showed satisfactory discrimination, calibration functions, clinical benefits and clinical impacts. Enrichment and immune infiltration analyses revealed significant differences in mitochondrial structure and function, immune cell disorders, and signaling pathway activation between the high- and low-mitochondrial gene expression UC groups. Correlations between mitochondrial structure and function and immune cells were evaluated. Single-cell RNA sequencing data were used to analyze the hub gene distribution, cell‒cell communication, and enrichment. Cell‒cell communication analysis revealed that immune response and pathogenesis pathways are activated in UC. Experiments revealed that the expression of the ACADM and ACADSB genes was decreased in UC patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of UC by altering energy metabolism, promoting immune disorders and activating pathogenic signaling pathways. The mitochondria-related genes are valuable for the diagnosis of UC. ACADM and ACADSB may play important roles in UC pathogenesis.

[PMID: 41186821] We studied the effects of female sex hormones estradiol and progesterone on the expression of CCR5 and CCR8 co-receptor genes (that play an important role in the HIV-1 entry into the cell) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from different female donors and infected with HIV-1 subtype G. Female sex hormones produced a dose-dependent effect on the replication of HIV-1 subtype G: low doses of estradiol and high doses of progesterone significantly induced CCR8 expression in PBMC of all donors, which correlated with an increase in viral load by 1.5-1.7 times on average. The exception was one donor, in whom a high dose of estradiol also induced an increase in CCR8 expression. High concentrations of progesterone also enhanced the expression of the CCR5 co-receptor. The detected differences in the co-receptor expression in infected PBMC from different donors indicates that the host genetics may also play an important role in PBMC susceptibility to HIV infection.

[PMID: 41186762] Fluoxastrobin (FLUO) is a fungicide from strobilurin family used widely worldwide. The use of FLUO pesticide is on the rise and this phenomenon is accompanied by a series of concerns such as endocrine disruption. In order to determine the potential toxic effects of FLUO, cell culture, gene expression and molecular docking assays were conducted as it is crucial to determine the interaction between chemicals and nuclear receptors in order to estimate and understand the impact of the chemical. This study analyzed the quantum properties of FLUO at the molecular quantum mechanical level using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-311 + + G(d, p) and cc-pVDZ basis sets including the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, chemical reactivity descriptors, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface calculation. In order to investigate molecular characteristics, topological (AIM, RDG) and Natural Bonding Orbitals (NBO) investigations were conducted. Molecular docking studies were performed with the title compound in the active sites of the proteins selected because of their role in xenobiotic metabolism. The docking result was determined to be a significant factor in bioactivity, a finding that is corroborated by the cytotoxic analysis of the FLUO compound. Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations are used to support molecular docking analysis. Toxicity of FLUO was tested on MDA-MB-231 cells using XTT and wound healing assays. IC50 value of FLUO was determined as 6,9 µg/ml. The impact of FLUO exposure at molecular level was assessed using qRT-PCR by determining the expression levels of PPARy, AhR and PXR genes where no statistically significant change was found.

[PMID: 41186719] Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase and core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is an important player in cancer progression through its powerful effects on chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. In addition to its classical role in regulating the cell cycle and tumor proliferation, numerous publications have identified the broad role of EZH2 in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), leading to immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. EZH2 has been shown to silence immune surveillance genes by binding to H3K27me3 histone, leading to epigenetic silencing in lymphomas and thereby reducing tumor immunogenicity, which facilitates immune escape. EZH2 also modulates the recruitment and activity of immunosuppressive cells by epigenetically modifying cytokine and chemokine networks. Importantly, EZH2 upregulates PD-L1 expression either directly or indirectly through its pro-oncogenic activation of STAT3 signaling, which induces T cell exhaustion and ultimately resistance to checkpoint inhibitors in cancers such as breast cancer and glioblastoma. Furthermore, EZH2 also influences the regulation of immune-related microRNAs, including the suppression of the miR-144/451a cluster, which encourages immunosuppressive macrophage polarization. Pharmacological EZH2 inhibition has been shown to be an arm of a synergistic therapy, combining immune checkpoint blockade therapies, which can reinstate antigen presentation and T cell infiltration, highlighting EZH2 as an essential epigenetic modulator of tumor-immune interactions. It remains a viable target for therapy to overcome immune resistance and improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes.

[PMID: 41186626] To identify daily activity limitations, including but not limited to impairments in physical function, experienced by persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and identify Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) short form (SF) scales that can measure these limitations. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted among a diverse group of adults with RA across the spectrum of disease activity. PROMIS Upper Extremity (UE) SF7a, Physical Function (PF) SF8b, and a Task Difficulty Scale were used to assess daily activity limitations experienced by persons with RA in the United States. An open-ended question asking what other daily activity limitations respondents experienced was also included. The daily activity limitation in the text response and the three scale items were deductively coded using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) based on an established linking rule. Potential PROMIS SF scales were identified and linked to ICF to measure some activity limitations reported by persons with RA. PROMIS PF SF10a was linked to ICF and compared with UE SF7a and PF SF8b. Eighty-three out of 99 RA patient respondents answered the open-ended question, the majority (> 70%) of whom had severe or moderate physical function limitations. All 9 second-level sub-categories of the Activities and Participation (A&P) in ICF were linked to the text response to the open-ended question. UE SF7a and PF SF8b were linked to four of these second-level sub-categories (e.g., Mobility), while additional four second-level sub-categories (e.g., General tasks and demands, Interpersonal interactions and relationships) linked to PROMIS Fatigue SF7a and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities (APS) SF4a. Moreover, PF SF10a was linked to four of these second-level sub-categories too, but with fewer items than UE SF7a plus the PF SF8b. Some activity limitations, such as driving and using telecommunication devices, were not linked to any items of the five PROMIS SF scales. Persons with RA reported a variety of activity limitations across multiple domains, including physical function, telecommunication, social interactions, and other aspects of daily living, which could be a focus for goal-setting communication in the clinical setting. PROMIS PF SF10a may be a more effective and efficient scale to measure 4 sub-categories of daily activity limitations. To more comprehensively assess the spectrum of the impact of RA, it appears advisable to also use PROMIS Fatigue SF7a and APS SF4a to examine General tasks and demands, and Interpersonal interactions and relationships limitations.

[PMID: 41186505] Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained growing interest for its potential metabolic benefits. However, the unique physiological aspects of Ramadan fasting (RF), a culturally and religiously significant form of dry IF, remain underexplored, particularly regarding liver disease. RF imposes distinct metabolic and circadian challenges through prolonged daily fasting and altered meal timing, placing considerable demands on hepatic adaptability. Given the liver's essential role in energy balance, metabolism, and inflammation, as well as the high prevalence of liver disease in many Muslim-majority regions, it is crucial to better understand how RF impacts liver health. This review synthesizes current evidence on how RF can impact liver function, including its effects on insulin sensitivity, autophagy, gut microbiota, gene expression, and inflammation-related pathways. We further reviewed the clinical implications of RF across the broad spectrum of liver conditions, from metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) to advanced cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and post-transplant states. By addressing this knowledge gap, this review offers an evidence-based foundation for culturally sensitive and risk-stratified fasting recommendations in individuals with liver disease.

[PMID: 41186347] This study explored the metabolic shifts in <i>Rosa roxburghii</i> Tratt juice (RRTJ) following fermentation and assessed its impact on adipocyte differentiation. Non-targeted metabolomics revealed significant changes, particularly in flavor-related compounds and flavonoid profiles, with KEGG enrichment analysis highlighting energy metabolism and secondary metabolic pathways. Cluster analysis categorized differentially expressed metabolites into flavor-forming and anti-inflammatory/antioxidant groups. Quantitatively, RRT extract had a flavonoid content of 7.64% (0.764 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>), while RRTJ and <i>Rosa roxburghii</i> Tratt fermentation broth (RRTFB) contained 1.31% and 1.13% flavonoids, respectively. Network pharmacology identified nine key anti-inflammatory/antioxidant compounds, four of which were flavonoids, with molecular docking confirming strong binding affinities to SIRT1. <i>In vitro</i> experiments using 3T3-L1 cells demonstrated that RRT-derived flavonoids inhibited adipocyte differentiation by regulating SIRT1 expression. RRT-derived flavonoids exert anti-adipogenic effects <i>via</i> SIRT1 pathway activation, offering insights into its functional properties and processing applications.

[PMID: 41186345] Dysbiosis, defined as an imbalance in the gut microbiota, disrupts the gut barrier and impairs host immune and metabolic responses, playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dietary flavonoids have been explored as safer alternatives to conventional drugs, showing efficacy in alleviating inflammation and restoring barrier integrity in colitis models. However, whether their anti-colitic activity is preserved under human microbial dysbiosis remains unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated microbiota on the efficacy of 3-deoxyflavonoids (3-DFs) and 3-hydroxyflavonoids (3-HFs), using a humanized interleukin (IL)-10<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup> mouse model. Four near-isogenic lines (NILs) of corn, Lines A (lacking 3-DF or 3-HF), B (expressing only 3-DF), C (expressing only 3-HF), and D (expressing both 3-DF + 3-HF), were incorporated into experimental diets, alongside a purified control. Mice were colonized with fecal microbiota from UC patients and fed the respective diets. The effects of flavonoid-rich diets on distal colon inflammatory markers, tight-junction expression, and disease activity varied according to the microbial composition of the three UC donors. Higher concentrations of gut metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids, were associated with reduced inflammation and enhanced barrier function. Overall, the composition of dysbiotic human microbiota influenced the anti-colitic activity of dietary flavonoids. When protective effects were observed, diets containing 3-HF were more effective than those with only 3-DF. These findings highlight the need to account for individual microbial profiles when designing flavonoid-based dietary interventions for IBD.",10

The effects of such extended aggregation of doses form an important part of the everyday concerns of radiological protection against low-level exposures. For more than half a century, databases of nuclear workers have been assembled, and the numbers of workers currently included in studies, together with the numbers of deaths among them that have now occurred, are capable of generating reasonably precise risk estimates that should provide meaningful comparisons with those obtained from other studies, such as of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, constructing, updating and maintaining these large databases, linking workers to occupational dose databases and to registers of deaths (and other outcomes, such as incident cancers) and their causes, and analyses of these data that endeavour to take account of other influential factors (such as smoking) are far from straightforward. A critical review of recent nuclear worker studies illustrates the difficulties in reliably interpreting reported statistical associations between rates of cancer and cumulative occupational doses because of the real possibility of distortions produced by biases, confounding and/or the interplay of radiation with other risk factors. This doesn't mean that studies of nuclear workers should be abandoned, far from it, but it does mean that appropriate effort needs to be expended on these studies before confident conclusions about the levels of risks from radiation exposure can be drawn from them. Unexpected findings should be examined in depth to gain a proper understanding of their origin, including the impact of doses from intakes of radionuclides upon dose-responses derived using doses from external sources of radiation.

[PMID: 41187327] Neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized as pain arising from lesions of the somatosensory nervous system. However, NP-like features have been found in several chronic secondary musculoskeletal (MSK) pain conditions in the absence of detectable lesion or damage to the somatosensory pathways. Emerging evidence has demonstrated associations between NP-like symptoms and altered neural activity within brain regions implicated in sensory perception and affective-emotional processing of pain with consistent findings of abnormal activity in the right insula (RIns) cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG-NF) is a brain-computer interface biofeedback technique that allows individuals to self-regulate the real-time cortical brain activities of the regions of interest. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of a novel EEG-NF intervention designed to simultaneously downtrain activity in the RIns and dACC in individuals with a chronic secondary MSK pain condition exhibiting NP-like features. In addition, this study will conduct secondary exploratory analyses to investigate EEG-derived neuronal changes and their associations with clinical and experimental pain outcomes following the EEG-NF training. We will design a single-arm, open-label, pilot-feasibility trial. We will recruit adults aged 35-75 years with a score of ≥19 using the PainDETECT questionnaire and an average pain score of ≥4 on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the last 3 months, with a minimum pain duration of 3 months, to receive active EEG-NF training. Participants will receive auditory feedback as a reward for achieving a predetermined activity threshold of the RIns and dACC. Primary outcomes will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and safety using both self-reported questionnaires and monitoring data. Collected data will be summarized descriptively, with mean (SD) reported where appropriate. Secondary outcomes will include EEG parameters, self-reported measures, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing. An exploratory within-group pre-post statistical comparison will be conducted for all secondary outcome measures, and correlation analysis will be performed to explore relationships between EEG measures, self-reported outcomes, heart rate variability, and quantitative sensory testing measures. This study has received approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Participant recruitment began in April 2025 and is ongoing. As of October 2025, data collection has been completed, with a total of 5 participants enrolled, all of whom have completed the study to date. We expect to complete the study in March 2026. This study will generate data on feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary data to inform a fully powered effectiveness clinical trial. The results and data generated will inform the design and sample size calculation for a fully powered randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of EEG-NF in targeting NP-like features in individuals with chronic MSK pain.

[PMID: 41187292] Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to poor outcomes after spinal deformity correction, but it is unclear whether osteoporosis is the underlying factor. This study analyzed a national administrative database to clarify this association. The 2010 to Q1 2022 PearlDiver M161 database was queried for adult spinal deformity surgeries. Patients were stratified by not having versus having vitamin D deficiency diagnosis and matched 4:1 based on age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and multivariate analysis (controlling for age, sex, and CCI) for 90-day postoperative adverse events was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs, Bonferroni correction, α < 0.00417). These methods were then repeated adding osteoporosis to the matching and multivariate controlling variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis comparing 5-year cumulative revision surgery rates was also performed for both sets of comparisons. In the primary analyses matching for age, sex, and CCI, the vitamin D deficiency cohort showed a higher likelihood of osteoporosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased odds of aggregated any (OR 1.34) and minor adverse events (1.39), as well as wound dehiscence (OR 1.91). The vitamin D deficiency group had a higher 5-year revision surgery rate (39.3% vs. 31.7%, P = 0.006).When osteoporosis was included as a matched/controlled variable, vitamin D deficiency was only associated with higher odds of aggregate any (OR 1.35) adverse events and urinary tract infection (OR 1.56). No difference in 5-year revision surgery rates was observed. Following adult deformity surgery, many of the perioperative adverse outcomes were similar regardless of controlling for osteoporosis, but 5-year revisions seemed to be driven by the osteoporosis rather than vitamin D deficiency.

[PMID: 41187198] We analyzed stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values (δ13C and δ15N, respectively) for pan-Arctic coastal primary producers and consumers to detect large-scale regional trends both temporally and spatially. To facilitate comparison, we grouped coastal habitats into fjords, lagoons, shelves, and straits as four ""coastscapes"". We gathered over 12,000 rows of data collected over 24 years (between 1999 and 2022) from 34 different field campaigns across the coastal Arctic (63 to 81°N and 177°W to 33°E). Our goal was to examine the isotopic patterns in pelagic and sediment particulate organic matter (pPOM and sPOM, respectively) and four consumer groups (deposit feeders, opportunists/scavengers, predators, and suspension feeders) among the four coastscapes. We found that despite the enormous spatial range of data, both pPOM and sPOM became 2.1‰ and 2.2‰ more 13C-depleted per decade, respectively, with parallel decreases in the δ13C values in consumers. The significant decrease is likely attributed to the increased contributions of 13C-depleted terrestrial organic matter across the Arctic coasts from freshwater inputs and coastal erosion in concert with diminishing sea ice that supports sympagic microalgae. Across all Arctic coastscapes, consumer groups exhibited overlapping isotopic composition, notably with wide δ13C ranges that indicated assimilation of multiple organic matter sources, including terrestrial organic matter, organic matter derived from marine phytoplankton and sea ice algae, macroalgae, and potentially benthic microalgae or degraded organic matter. This consistent pattern across coastscapes provides evidence of the trophic plasticity possessed by Arctic consumers, how coastal food webs respond to climate warming, and the signature of terrestrialization imprinted on the pan-Arctic coastal isoscape.

[PMID: 41187098] Pain, both acute and chronic, places a substantial burden on global healthcare systems. While conventional treatments may be limited in efficacy due to side effects, risk of dependency, or variable individual response, there is growing interest in mind-body complementary approaches. Yoga Nidra (YGN) has emerged as a promising non-invasive intervention for pain management. However, a clear understanding of its efficacy remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of YGN on pain outcomes. A literature search was conducted across seven databases and one trial database. Eligible studies included quantitative designs assessing the effects of YGN on pain. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials and the modified Downs and Black checklist for non-randomized studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled effect sizes. Twelve studies, comprising 1,176 participants, were included. Between-group analyses revealed that YGN significantly reduced pain compared to passive comparators (Hedge's g: -2.05, p=0.01), while comparisons with active comparators (g: -0.31, p= 0.53) showed no statistically significant differences. Within-group analyses indicated significant pain reduction following YGN (g: -2.01, p<0.001). Subgroup comparisons of single versus multiple training sessions, as well as meta-regression analyses, revealed no significant dose-response relationship across intervention durations. YGN shows potential in reducing pain intensity compared to passive control conditions, with notable within-group improvements following intervention. However, given the low methodological quality across the included studies, these effects should be interpreted cautiously, as the observed effects may represent inflated estimates. Despite these limitations, YGN demonstrates potential as a complementary approach for pain management, underscoring the need for high-quality, standardized research to establish its efficacy as a viable clinical intervention.

[PMID: 41187074] <b>Introduction.</b> Gastrointestinal infections remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality within the UK.<b>Hypothesis.</b> The Luminex<sup>®</sup> NxTAG<sup>®</sup> Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (NxTAG GPP) multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR assay performs equivalently to standard-of-care diagnostic approaches.<b>Aim.</b> To compare the analytical performance of the NxTAG GPP assay versus routine diagnostic testing methods in a district general hospital setting.<b>Methodology.</b> Gastrointestinal pathogens in 159 faecal specimens from hospital inpatients and outpatient clinics were comparatively analysed using the NxTAG GPP assay versus traditional culture, enzyme immunoassay and molecular methods.<b>Results.</b> Positive results were detected in 45 out of 159 specimens (28.3%) by NxTAG GPP, which was a higher positivity rate when compared with traditional diagnostic methods which detected 31 out of 159 (19.5%) positive infections (<i>P</i>=0.087 by Fisher's exact test). Infections were caused by a single organism in 40 out of 45 (88.9%) cases, but 5 out of 45 (11.1%) infections detected were due to coinfections. No coinfections were detected by traditional methods. <i>Campylobacter</i> Group was the most common enteropathogen detected with 15 out of 52 (28.9%) infections. Viruses caused 26.9% of infections, including 15.4% being norovirus. Overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the NxTAG GPP assay were 97.6%, 99.7% and 99.5%, respectively, for enteropathogenic bacteria and viruses detected during this study. No parasites were detected during this study and were not included in comparisons.<b>Conclusions.</b> The NxTAG GPP assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for identifying gastrointestinal pathogens, with comparable accuracy as more resource-intensive and time-consuming standard diagnostic approaches. The NxTAG GPP has the potential to enhance patient diagnosis, reduce turnaround time and improve clinical outcomes compared to routine diagnostic methods.

[PMID: 41187065] The regulation of new psychoactive substances (NPS) varies across countries and regions, and China's program provides important experience for global control of NPS. The aim of the study was to analyze the regulation of NPS in China and provide an important reference for global NPS control. This paper analyzes the legislation, scheduling methods, scheduling updates, and legal prosecution of NPS in China, and discusses improvements in the scheduling of NPS. A combination of individual listing with generic legislation is a feasible option for NPS scheduling. Taiwan regularly updates the scheduling of NPS every three months, and Hong Kong frequently updates the chemical parent nucleus and relevant substituent groups in generic legislation, both of which are valuable practices. The decriminalization of drug abuse imposes lighter penalties in mainland China, and it is also worth learning from the mandatory education programs for drug abusers on the harms of NPS in Taiwan. Taiwan and Macao have classified NPS, as they contend that it is more scientific to apply different penalties to different classifications of NPS. It is suggested that the global community adopt a combined approach of individual listing and generic legislation, regularly update NPS schedules, continuously update the chemical parent nucleus and relevant substituent groups in generic legislation, classify NPS, and apply different penalties, and implement mandatory education programs for NPS users.

[PMID: 41187011] To compare the effectiveness and prognosis of lamellar keratoplasty (LK) using human cornea and acellular porcine corneal stroma (APCS) for noninfectious peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK). Fifty-eight patients with noninfectious PUK who underwent LK from 2013 to 2023 were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into human cornea (n = 27) and APCS (n = 31) groups according to corneal graft material. The primary outcome was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate graft survival rates within 12 months. BCVA improved in both groups. The human cornea group had better BCVA at 3 months (p = 0.045) and 6 months (p = 0.010) postoperatively, but no significant difference was observed at 1 or 12 months (p > 0.05). Corneal epithelial healing time was similar overall, but prolonged in the APCS group among patients with autoimmune diseases (p = 0.012). The number of transparent corneal grafts was higher in the human cornea group at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < 0.05), but comparable at 12 months (p > 0.05). Complications occurred in 13 APCS patients and 10 human cornea patients (p > 0.05). Graft survival rates were 80.6% for APCS and 88.8% for human cornea at 12 months (p > 0.05). APCS is a feasible alternative for noninfectious PUK, with promising visual recovery and long-term outcomes. However, its midterm effectiveness may be slightly inferior, especially in patients with autoimmune diseases, suggesting a need for tailored approaches.

[PMID: 41186961] Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a perioperative multimodal approach aimed at improving post-surgery functional outcomes. Its implementation in patients with intracranial aneurysms undergoing craniotomy is insufficient. Hence, we aimed to investigate whether the ERAS protocol is better than the conventional protocol in terms of favorable outcomes. The primary outcome of the study was postoperative hospital length of stay (LOS). The secondary outcomes included intraoperative fentanyl consumption, postoperative pain assessment and analgesic requirement, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, postoperative complications, functional recovery, and patient satisfaction. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I or II patients with anterior circulation aneurysms (18-65 years) with World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade 1 were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups: ERAS group (group E) or conventional group (group C) using computer-generated sequence numbers. Exclusion criteria included nonconsenting patients, posterior circulation aneurysms, WFNS grades 2, 3, 4, and 5, age <18 or >65 years, ASA grade III, IV, V, pregnant patients, patients requiring postoperative ventilation, history of brain surgery, preoperative cognitive dysfunction, and body mass index (BMI) >40. Quantitative data underwent analysis via t test or Mann-Whitney U test, while qualitative data were subjected to χ2 test or Z test of proportions. The value of P < .05 was considered significant. A total of 46 patients were analyzed for the study, 23 in each group. Demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. The mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD) of LOS in group E was 8.0 ± 2.4 days and those were in group C was 8.9 ± 2.7 days, which were comparable (difference 0.9 [95% confidence interval {CI}, -2.32 to 0.67; P = .28]). The duration of the mean ICU stay was shorter in group E in comparison to those in group C (20.9 ± 6.8 hours vs 28.9 ± 9.0 hours; difference 8; 95% CI, 12.7 to -3.37; P = .001). The additional intraoperative fentanyl requirement was significantly lower in group E in comparison to those in group C (132 ± 40 vs 183 ± 39 µg; difference 51, 95% CI, -73.8 to -27.0; P < .001). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in group E in comparison to group C (4 [3-5] vs 3 [2-4]; difference 1; 95% CI, 0-2; P < .001). ERAS protocol within the domain of intracranial aneurysm surgery results in early ICU discharge, augmented patient satisfaction, improved postoperative pain scores, and a potentially higher score in functional recovery.",10
